	Part of the heat energy is dissipated into jostling the bar magnets back into random directions, cooling the disk below room temperature. A second stream of water runs over the disk, and that cool water is used to chill the refrigerator.
	Although the concept is straightforward, researchers have been refining the details, first looking for metals that maximize the magnetocaloric effect. The current prototype uses a disk, about the size of a CD, made of gadolinium, a metal used in the recording heads of video recorders.
	Earlier prototypes also used superconducting magnets -- which themselves have to be chilled to very low temperatures -- to generate the magnetic field.
	In the latest prototype, the scientists fashioned a permanent magnet that generates a field nearly as strong.
	''This is getting closer to a real machine that you put in a real device,'' said Dr. Karl A. Gschneidner Jr., a senior metallurgist at the Ames Laboratory in Iowa, who has been working on the prototypes with colleagues at Ames and a company, the Astronautics Corporation of America in Milwaukee.
	The use of a permanent magnet is ''definitely a nice advance,'' said Dr. Robert D. Shull, leader of the magnetic materials group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md.
