	What he did not remember was his vehement opposition to psychotropic medication on the ground that it was not natural and would change his brain chemistry.
	Of course, he was right. Like Eric, many patients and therapists share the view that psychotherapy is preferable to pharmacotherapy because it is more ''natural'' and because it supposedly gets to the root of the patient's problem. They are convinced that self-understanding will bring relief, whether the problem is anxiety, depression or obsessional thinking.
	Insight is a prerequisite of happiness, the theory goes, and well-being achieved without the hard work of psychotherapy is artificial and inauthentic.
	But new evidence suggests that the talking cure and psychotropic medication have much more in common than had been thought. In fact, both produce surprisingly similar changes in the brain.
	Take Eric's obsessive compulsive disorder. It hobbles patients with unwanted thoughts, often violent or sexual, that play in the mind like a broken record. Owing to the sometimes lurid nature of the thoughts, the treatment mainstay had for years been psychoanalytically oriented therapy to unlock the sexual and aggressive conflicts presumed to underlie the symptoms.
	There was just one problem.
