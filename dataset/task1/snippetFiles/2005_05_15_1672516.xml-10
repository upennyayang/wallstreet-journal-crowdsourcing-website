	EXUBERANCE null
	When Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, sagely warned rabid stock touts and gullible investors about irrational exuberance in 1996, he used an adjective to cast a pall over a beautiful noun. Ever since, the word exuberance -- rooted in ''fruitful, fertile,'' related to a cow's uber, ''udder'' -- has picked up an old sense of excess.
	Comes now one of the world's best-known psychiatrists to the word's rescue. Prof. Kay Redfield Jamison of Johns Hopkins, author of the best seller ''An Unquiet Mind'' and co-author of a doorstop-size classic medical text on manic depressive illness, has given us an uplifting reading experience: ''Exuberance: The Passion for Life.''
	''Words for desolation come apace,'' Jamison notes, ''those for exuberance less so. . . . In part this is because the language for melancholy is such a rich and nuanced one.'' She's right: it's enough to make us a pack of dispirited, despondent, Gloomy Guses.
	But what of the synonymy of cheer? Sprightliness, enthusiasm, exultation, spiritedness, buoyancy, Ã©lan, ebullience -- all these upbeat, elated words are there to back up exuberance.
	This is probably apocryphal, but I once heard a literary legend about Robert Louis Stevenson, a man of wide mood swings.
