	''It's not that I'm so smart,'' Einstein once said, ''It's just that I stay with problems longer.'' Whatever the reason for his greatness, there is no doubt that this determination allowed him to invent courageous new physics and explore realms that nobody else had dared to investigate.
	What he was not, however, was a perfect genius. In fact, when it came to the biggest scientific issue of all -- the origin of the universe -- he was utterly wrong. And while we should certainly laud his achievements over the next 12 months, we may learn a more valuable lesson by investigating Einstein's greatest failure.
	The story starts in the late 19th century, when the scientific establishment believed in an eternal and unchanging universe. This was a neat theory of cosmology, because a universe that had always existed did not raise any awkward questions, such as ''When was the universe created?'' and ''What (or Who) created it?''
	Einstein grew up in this era, and was similarly convinced that the universe had existed for an eternity. However, when he developed general relativity (his theory of gravity) in 1915, he became aware of a tricky problem.
