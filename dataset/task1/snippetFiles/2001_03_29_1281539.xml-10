	Dr. William Unruh, a physicist at the University of British Columbia and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, said, ''I find it hard to believe that one could get an effect in LIGO.''
	Physicists have struggled for decades to find a theory that joins quantum mechanics, which describes the fuzziness of ordinary matter at small scales, and Einstein's theory of relativity, which shows how gravity warps space. Those ''quantum gravity'' theories differ in detail, but many predict that space itself should be fuzzy and fluctuating on unimaginably tiny scales.
	Dr. Ng's theory says the combined effects of those fluctuations should be detectable. Discovering those fluctuations could guide physicists to the correct quantum gravity theory.
	Dr. Stuart Shapiro, a physicist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, compared the theory to surprising predictions just after World War II that fluctuating electric and magnetic fields in apparently empty space could have measurable effects on electrons in atoms -- predictions that were later verified.
	Even if the effects are not as large as Dr. Ng predicts, said Dr. Abhay Ashtekar, director of the Center for Gravitational Physics and Geometry at Pennsylvania State University, the calculation offers hope that quantum gravity theories can be checked.
