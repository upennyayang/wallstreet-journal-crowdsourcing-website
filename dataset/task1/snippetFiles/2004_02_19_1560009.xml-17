	The review panel said the plan's strongest element was its architecture for organizing the dispersed efforts of 13 agencies to focus on a few central goals, including improving knowledge of past and current climate shifts and the influences -- both natural and human -- that shape them and reducing uncertainties in projections of how Earth's climate may shift in coming decades.
	''Although the plan was developed for a 10-year time frame, it could effectively guide climate change research for decades,'' provided it is revised every three to five years to reflect advances in the science, the panel said in a statement.
	One of the biggest weaknesses in the administration's plan, the panel said, was the absence of any significant reference to existing research examining the potential effects of climate change around the United States.
	Particularly notable, it said, was the omission of any reference to the National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change. That 2001 report, done at the request of Congress, was compiled by academic and government scientists over several years.
	White House officials have been continually pressed by industry lobbyists and antiregulatory groups to remove references to the assessment from government documents.
