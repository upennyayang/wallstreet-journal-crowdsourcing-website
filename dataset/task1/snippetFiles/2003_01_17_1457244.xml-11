	Dr. Padian said Dr. Dial's demonstration of this new use of wings added to earlier research that had determined that the dinosaur ancestors of birds had both feathers and the right limb structure to make a flight stroke. Even without flying ability, he said, wings and feathers offered evolutionary benefit, in terms of isolation and catching prey. Those dinosaurs, he said, could have used a forward predatory grab similar to a flight stroke. The new use of wings, he said, offers an additional survival benefit for a proto-wing. Dr. Alan Gishlick, a paleontologist who also studies the evolution of flight, said, the research ''for the first time gives us a modern analog for terrestrial origin of flight.'' Dr. Gishlick, who is at the National Center for Science Education in Oakland, Calif., a nonprofit group that defends the teaching of evolution in public schools, said the fossils of dinosaurs he has studied showed they had the bone and muscle structure for this use of wings. ''Dinosaurs like velociraptor could have done this,'' he said. He was not suggesting that velociraptors flew, since they seem to have been a highly successful predator on their feet.
