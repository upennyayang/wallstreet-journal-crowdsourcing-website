	Dr. Lunine said the fact that no craters had been seen ''tells us that Titan's surface is young,'' its basins filled in with material from such volcanic upwellings or hydrocarbon precipitation from the sky.
	Other remote-sensing instruments on Cassini detected evidence that Titan had lost three-quarters of its original atmosphere. Much of its light nitrogen seems to have escaped over time. But the methane content appears to have remained constant.
	It could be that Titan has replenished methane escaping from the atmosphere, said Dr. Tobias Owen of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. ''Where did it come from?'' he added. ''That is the question.''
	Scientists suggested that some atmospheric hydrocarbons were being replenished from underground sources of liquid methane.
	Both before and after Cassini's close encounter, scientists often reminded themselves and others not to make hasty interpretations or be discouraged. They recalled the experience of the earliest spacecraft explorations of Mars. In the first three flybys of Mars, in the 1960's, Dr. Owen pointed out, the Mariner spacecraft ''happened by chance to go over the most boring portion'' of that planet, where the unrelieved cratered landscape invited comparisons with the desolate surface of Earth's Moon.
