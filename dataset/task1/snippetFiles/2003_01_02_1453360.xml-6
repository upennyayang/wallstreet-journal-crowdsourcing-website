	The result in coming decades could be substantial ecological disruption, local losses of wildlife and extinction of some species, the two studies said.
	The authors express their findings with a certainty far greater than in the last decade, when many of the same researchers contributed to reports on biological effects of warming that were published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the top international research group on the issue.
	The authors of one of the new Nature papers, Dr. Camille Parmesan, a biologist at the University of Texas, and Dr. Gary Yohe, an economist at Wesleyan University, calculated that many ecological changes measured in recent decades had a 95 percent chance of being a result of climate warming and not some other factor.
	''You're seeing the impact of climate on natural systems now,'' Dr. Yohe said. ''It's really important to take that seriously.''
	Some butterflies have shifted northward in Europe by 30 to 60 miles or more, with the changes closely matching those in average warm-season temperatures, Dr. Parmesan said. The researchers were able to rule out other factors -- habitat destruction, for example -- as causes of the changes.
