	Nobody expects offshore wind farms to be cheap. At $12 million, the five onshore turbines in Atlantic City cost just a fraction of the expected costs for the far larger New Jersey and LIPA projects.
	While the Long Island Power Authority and FPL have declined to estimate the cost of building the 40 South Shore turbines, estimates generally run from $300 million to $400 million. The 80 New Jersey turbines could cost twice as much, depending on water depth and other factors.
	LIPA would also pay an estimated $40 million to run a transmission line to an onshore power substation near Massapequa from a floating substation connected to the turbines. Transmission costs in New Jersey would depend on the turbines' distance from shore and their proximity to a near-shore substation, a key consideration. The five Atlantic City turbines are next to a substation.
	A report done for the New Jersey blue-ribbon panel noted that the cost of generating electricity from onshore wind turbines dropped from 30 cents a kilowatt-hour in the early 1980s to about 5 cents now. But it estimated that offshore turbine generation cost close to 9 cents a kilowatt-hour because of higher construction, operating and transmission costs.
