	DURING a vacation last winter, I took a zip-line canopy tour of the Costa Rican rain forest. Strapped into a harness 100 feet above the jungle floor, I was flying through the air, with the toucans and parrots, attached to a steel cable strung between two platforms. I was having far too much fun to think that this could be dangerous. At first it was pretty thrilling, but by the 10th zip line I felt it was losing its charge.
	On the last and highest platform, a guy just in front of me began to hyperventilate. Being a psychiatrist, I realized he was having a panic attack. I got him to relax with some deep breathing and then asked him whether he had had this problem before. ''Oh, yes,'' he said. ''I thought this would be a way to conquer my fear of heights.''
	Why was he terrified by what was beginning to bore me? We were both members of the sex that studies and more informal surveys indicate is more drawn to thrill seeking (for better or worse -- more men than women have orbited the earth, while men are two to three more times likely to be pathological gamblers).
