	People on all sides of the debate say that if evangelical leaders take a stand, they could change the political dynamics on global warming.
	The administration has refused to join the international Kyoto treaty and opposes mandatory emission controls.
	The issue has failed to gain much traction in the Republican-controlled Congress. An overwhelming majority of evangelicals are Republicans, and about four out of five evangelicals voted for President Bush last year, according to the Pew Research Center.
	The Rev. Ted Haggard, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, an umbrella group of 51 church denominations, said he had become passionate about global warming because of his experience scuba diving and observing the effects of rising ocean temperatures and pollution on coral reefs.
	''The question is, Will evangelicals make a difference, and the answer is, The Senate thinks so,'' Mr. Haggard said. ''We do represent 30 million people, and we can mobilize them if we have to.''
	In October the association paved the way for broad-based advocacy on the environment when it adopted ''For the Health of the Nation: An Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility,'' a platform that included a plank on ''creation care'' that many evangelical leaders say was unprecedented.
