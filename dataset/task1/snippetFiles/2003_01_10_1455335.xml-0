	Under pressure from environmental and animal welfare groups, the Commerce Department agreed today to delay imposing a rule that would relax the definition of ''dolphin safe'' tuna.
	The groups negotiated a deal with government lawyers that would delay any departmental action on the rule for 90 days, when the change is scheduled to enter into litigation in federal court in San Francisco.
	The conservation groups, in turn, agreed not to seek a temporary restraining order against the government. In previous lawsuits, the groups have twice succeeded in blocking an easing of the dolphin-safe designation.
	The action today leaves intact strict criteria that tuna producers must meet to sell their product with a ''dolphin safe'' label. No tuna that is caught using purse seine nets to encircle dolphins may be called dolphin safe, and there must be no dolphins killed or seriously injured in the process.
	The deal was a victory -- though a temporary one -- for nine conservation groups that accused the Bush administration of ignoring what they say is scientific evidence that the fishing practices used by tuna fishermen from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America are harming depleted dolphin populations.
