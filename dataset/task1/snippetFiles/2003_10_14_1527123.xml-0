	Ambition or love? Freedom or security? Perfect job here or perfect mate in Utah? Life forces painful choices on Dr. Michael J. Ryan's colleagues, but it is even harder on his research subject, the male túngara frog: the more sex it gets, the surer it is to be eaten.
	Dr. Ryan, who leads the integrative biology section at the University of Texas, is best known for work on the túngara, but he ponders other animals that live between a rock and a hard place: an all-female species of fish that clones itself but must mate with an alien male to do it; tiny salamanders with cells too big for their body plans; birds that must feed the chicks of another kind of bird to support their offspring.
	Biologists should learn from life's existential quandaries, he says, but many do not. Instead, they sweep the difficulties under the rug of ''adaptationism,'' the notion that everything about an animal's body and behavior has been honed to enhance its ''fitness'' or chance of passing on genes.
	That idea reminds him of Dr. Pangloss in Voltaire's satire ''Candide,'' who says all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds -- even earthquakes, plagues and torture.
