	In the first Weizmann computer, the string of DNA the researchers wanted to analyze --the input data -- was created with one of its two strands left incomplete. Floating in the same test tube was the computer's software DNA, also created with a free-ended molecule. The software strands were designed to include all of the possible symbol and state combinations on their open strands. Like two halves of a zipper with mismatched teeth, not all the open input-software DNA sections could mesh with the open sections of all the software DNA. But when the open string of the input DNA encountered a software string with an open end that was complementary to its own, the two joined and were sealed by an enzyme. Spacers engineered into the resulting DNA string then attracted another enzyme. It made another ragged cut, starting the matching process over again.
	This matching, cutting and sealing continued until a special output detector DNA molecule fit the open end of the strand. The final molecule that was created provided the answer to the researchers' question.
	The second computer, described in a paper published last month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, eliminated the sealing of the input DNA with the software DNA.
