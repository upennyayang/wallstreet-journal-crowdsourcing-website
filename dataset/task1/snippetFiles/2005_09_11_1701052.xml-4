	Philosophers remember this phrase as used by the Liebnizian metaphysician Bertrand Russell nearly a century ago: back then, the neorealists, or New Realists, held that contrary to the theory of the Idealists, objects existed in the external world independent of the way we perceived them. (I anticipate learned e-mail chastisement from philosophers for oversimplifying.) ''In the academic field of international relations,'' writes Gary Rosen, managing editor of Commentary magazine, long a forum for neocons, ''self-proclaimed neorealists have flourished for decades.'' After their post-9/11 period of quiescence, among their mainly Democratic articulators are Republicans who include the former Nixon aides Brent Scowcroft (who wrote the elder Bush's Ukrainian speech) and Robert Ellsworth, as well as Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. An advocacy group strongly opposing the conduct of the present conflict in Iraq named itself the Coalition for a Realistic Foreign Policy. Although Josef Joffe, the publisher-editor of Die Zeit in Hamburg, notes that ''realpolitik and idealpolitik'' have reinforced each other in the past, in the natural shortening of political labels we can expect the neocons to find themselves faced by the neoreals (pronounced NE-o-re-ALS).
