	Twenty-seven hours later, NEAR started sending signals again. ''But it wasn't fine,'' Dr. Farquhar said. In stabilizing its gyrations, NEAR had used up about 65 pounds of propellant. Had it lost another 35 pounds, it would have never made it to Eros.
	Far off-course, NEAR zoomed past Eros on Dec. 23, three days after aborted engine firing. With its fuel low, the spacecraft could not make a quick U-turn, but instead set on a longer, looping path that brought it back to Eros a year later.
	NEAR entered orbit around Eros, named after the Greek god of love, on Valentine's Day last year. That was not a coincidence.
	The original rendezvous date -- Jan. 10, 1999 -- coincided with Dr. Farquhar's fifth wedding anniversary. ''I pick dates that are romantic or whatever,'' Dr. Farquhar said. ''It would have cost too much fuel to get back for our sixth wedding anniversary, so then what I wanted to do was give a Valentine's Day present to my wife.''
	This year's landing was another Valentine's Day present, albeit two days early.
	The hibernating NEAR Shoemaker will enter total darkness in August, with temperatures dropping below minus-230.
