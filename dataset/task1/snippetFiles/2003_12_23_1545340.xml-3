	In some parts of the world, sand dunes can be notoriously disruptive. It is not unheard of in China and Africa, for instance, for a migrating dune to advance on an unsuspecting village at a rate of more than 50 feet a year, blocking off roads and blanketing farmland.
	That is pretty quick for an enormous heap of sand, Mr. Schwämmle said, but for the purposes of a study, it is excruciatingly slow. A single collison between two shifting dunes can last well over a year.
	''A lot of people didn't believe this process could happen probably because it's so tough to study,'' he said. ''It's very slow, so it's difficult to take snapshots of one dune going through another.''
	By using computer simulations, which sped up the collisions, Mr. Schwämmle found that the crucial variable was height. Smaller barchan dunes often bump into larger ones from behind because they move faster and are carried by winds blowing in one direction. The unidirectional winds are also what give barchans, which can range from several feet to over 30 feet in height, their characteristic crescent shapes.
