	The new law says that, for the purpose of Medicare reimbursement, Lee County, Ill., is deemed to be in the Chicago metropolitan area. That seemingly minor change will provide $750,000 a year in extra Medicare money to the county's only hospital, the Katherine Shaw Bethea Hospital in Dixon, Ill., a small rural town 100 miles west of Chicago.
	The county is represented in Congress by J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House. Darryl L. Vandervort, president of the hospital, said, ''Mr. Hastert has been working with us on this for three years.''
	But Mr. Vandervort insisted: ''This is not pork-barrel spending. It was the right thing to do.''
	Likewise, under the new law, Brazoria County, Tex., is deemed to be part of the Houston area. Tom DeLay, the House Republican whip, represents most of the county. This provision is worth $380,000 a year to Angleton Danbury Medical Center in Angleton, 45 miles south of Houston. Patti E. Worfe, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said: ''Tom DeLay really made it happen.''
	Sometimes Congress earmarked money for specific hospitals by name. Mississippi, the home of the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, appears to have received more such grants than any other state.
