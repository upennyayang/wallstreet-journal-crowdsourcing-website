	The Honpa Hongwanji mission, the state's largest, sponsors the high school, but not all of its students are Buddhists. More than half come from Christian, public or home schools. The rest come from the mission's Buddhist elementary school. Bishop Yosemori said he hoped the faith would hold onto the young Buddhists, and possibly inspire them to become ministers. ''It's not our aim, but naturally we are hoping that many children can become good Buddhists in the future,'' he said. ''We are not trying to convert people to our religion, but through the Buddhist education system hopefully our local kids will aspire to be Buddhist ministers.'' Of the 36 temples in the Honpa Hongwanji denomination, Bishop Yosemori said, 14 are without resident ministers. Several students said they practiced no religion at home. Many of the Buddhist children said that they went to temple mostly on special occasions, and that despite its mandatory weekly service, they did not expect the academy to change that. Students said they went to the academy mainly because of its small classes and what appears to be a strong academic program. ''I came here for a better education,'' said Kaya Agena, 14, who attended a Honolulu public school.
