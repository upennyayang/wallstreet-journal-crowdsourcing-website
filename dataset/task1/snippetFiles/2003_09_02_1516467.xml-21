	Lawmakers in each party agree that, with the presidential primary season nearing, the time for bipartisan cooperation is running short.
	''Everybody assumes the longer we go on, the more partisan it becomes, the less likely we are to achieve things,'' Mr. McConnell said.
	Changes in tort law, another item high on President Bush's agenda, will also be on the Senate's agenda this fall. The Senate has already rejected a bill the House passed to place strict caps on jury awards in medical malpractice lawsuits, but two other measures -- one to create a $108 billion trust fund for victims of asbestos exposure and another that would alter the way class-action suits move through the courts -- are due for votes on the Senate floor.
	The asbestos measure, which would cancel pending legal settlements against asbestos manufacturers and settle claims through the trust fund, remains contentious. Only one Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, voted in favor of passing it out of committee, and some Republicans say they have reservations about it.
	Industry and insurance groups cannot agree over how to contribute to the fund, and some now oppose the bill.
	The class-action bill is closer to passing.
