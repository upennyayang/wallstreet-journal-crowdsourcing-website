	On top of all that, there is the issue of civic insecurity. Houstonians have always been a bit defensive about their brash oil boomtown carved from the bayous of East Texas, and now they are grappling with an existential question: Is their city too ugly?
	A leading Houston architect and civic planner, Daniel B. Barnum, posed the question recently on the op-ed page of The Houston Chronicle. He reported that the city had been ruled out as a contender for the 2012 Summer Olympics by a member of the selection committee who told a booster, ''We can't bring the world to all this ugliness.''
	Mr. Barnum, a member of the advisory Midtown Management District, did not quibble. With the Super Bowl less than half a year away, ''we are finally waking up to fact that much of our city is in fact ugly,'' he wrote. ''Why does it take a Super Bowl to wake us from our slumber? Can't we see the ugliness around us every day? Are we forever condemned to being this way?''
	Mr. Barnum said later that he was particularly referring to the welter of commercial signs along U.S. 59 the route into the city from George Bush Intercontinental Airport.
