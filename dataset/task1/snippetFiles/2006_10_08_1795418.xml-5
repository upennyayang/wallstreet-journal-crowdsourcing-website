	The title of Joshua Prager's winning new book comes from Blake, its theme of suspicion and guilt from Hawthorne, its method from Woodward and Bernstein. A baseball whodunit on an epic scale, it offers a heretofore secret view of the game's most memorable moment, a view that challenges verities about fair play, right conduct and lasting fame.
	''The Echoing Green'' is about a long-rumored but never before substantiated plot by the 1951 New York Giants to steal the signs of opposing catchers in games played at their home park, the Polo Grounds, during the last 10 weeks of the season. The Giants, 13 games behind the first-place Brooklyn Dodgers on Aug. 11, went on a 37-7 tear that pulled them into a tie for the pennant. No team had ever come from so far behind so late; nor has any since. The three-game playoff that followed ended with a stunning reversal of fortune in what remains, by general acclaim, the greatest baseball game ever played. With one out in the bottom of the ninth inning of the final game, on Oct. 3, the Giants' Bobby Thomson hit a three-run home run off Ralph Branca for a 5-4 victory.
