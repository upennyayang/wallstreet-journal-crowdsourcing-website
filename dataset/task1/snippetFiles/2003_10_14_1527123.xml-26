	Dr. Ryan calls this ''sensory exploitation'' -- a new behavior that succeeds in evolution because it takes advantage of existing ways of perceiving the world. The same principle causes a female fish of the swordtail species to prefer males with ''swords'' extending from their bodies. The swords fit the existing tuning of the fish visual system, inherited from some ancestor. A related species, the platyfish, has no swords. But when a male platyfish has a sword sewn onto his tail, platyfish females prefer him.
	To all this, adaptationists answer, essentially, So what? The important principle is that only traits that pass on genes will survive natural selection. How those traits arose is beside the point, argues Dr. Paul W. Sherman, a neurobiologist at Cornell and a leading researcher in the evolution of behavior. He and Dr. Ryan have continuing debates in the journals.
	''Regardless of how female preferences and male traits originated,'' Dr. Sherman wrote in an e-mail message, ''they will subsequently co-evolve depending on their reproductive consequences for females.''
	Though Dr. Sherman says he and Dr. Ryan do not know each other well, Dr. Ryan, characteristically, says they are friends. Nothing seems to ruffle his lively geniality.
