	Other scientists who work on global warming issues are now looking at Dr. Berg's findings.
	''His work is very convincing; I would even say unimpeachable,'' said Dr. Glenn Juday, a forest ecologist at the University of Alaska. ''For the first time, I now think beetle infestation is related to climate change.''
	While Dr. Juday did not collaborate on Dr. Berg's spruce studies, he relayed some of the findings at a recent conference on climate change in Oslo, as part of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment Project, a study by scientists from several nations. It was also presented by Dr. Berg himself in a speech at an American forestry conference this year.
	''There is enormous excitement over Ed Berg's studies,'' Dr. Juday said.
	But other scientists are still skeptical, saying it may be only a coincidence that rising temperatures go hand in hand with growing beetle infestations. Some say he has found a big piece of the puzzle, but not all of it.
	''I think Ed Berg is only partially correct,'' said Dr. Ed Holsten, who studies insects for the Forest Service in Alaska. The trees on the Kenai are old, and ripe for beetle outbreaks.
