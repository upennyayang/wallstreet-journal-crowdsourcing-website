	When the Vatican announced that it would beatify Pope Pius IX during its Jubilee celebrations last year, the Brown University historian David I. Kertzer had reservations. He knew that Pius IX, a staunch 19th-century critic of modernity who led the Roman Catholic Church during a tumultuous period that included the demise of the Papal States and the unification of Italy, was a favorite of the church's conservative wing.
	But Mr. Kertzer, an expert in 19th-century Italian history, also knew that when it came to Jews, Pius IX's behavior had sometimes been less than saintly. Interviewed on Italian national radio a few days before the beatification ceremony, Mr. Kertzer cited remarks Pius IX had made to an audience of Catholic women in 1871, in which he referred to Jews as ''dogs'' who went around ''barking in all the streets'' and ''molesting people everywhere.''
	At a news conference the next day, a Vatican spokesman dismissed Mr. Kertzer's evidence (from a book of the Pius IX's speeches), saying no ''serious historian'' had ever mentioned these remarks.
	To Mr. Kertzer's ears, this reaction was in keeping with other official church pronouncements on anti-Semitism in the past: with rare exceptions, it simply didn't exist.
