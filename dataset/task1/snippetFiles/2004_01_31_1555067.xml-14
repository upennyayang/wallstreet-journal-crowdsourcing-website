	''I would say I'm part of a new thinking within evangelicals,'' he said, adding that he receives angry e-mail messages for promoting sexual or violent movies. ''I get so tired of Christians that bash Hollywood.''
	''It isn't content that interests me,'' he said, continuing that even exploitation movies provide ''common ground'' for biblical discussion.
	''I was so disappointed 'Showgirls' wasn't a hit because I would have loved to discuss it,'' Mr. Bruce said.
	Ted Haggard, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, which represents 43,000 congregations, said that the Internet lent itself to all kinds of approaches, both direct and indirect, because different users were ready for different levels of information. A site that did not declare its intentions was the best way to reach some, just as an evangelist in a public square might begin by talking about secular concerns. ''You have a moral obligation not to be deceitful,'' he said. ''But you don't have a moral obligation to tell everything you know upfront.''
	Yet Mr. Haggard worried that on the Internet, anyone could come on as a religious authority -- ''even a crazy person.''
