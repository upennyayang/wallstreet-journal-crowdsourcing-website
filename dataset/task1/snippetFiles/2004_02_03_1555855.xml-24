	One way Dr. Berner and his colleagues study oxygen levels is by looking at a different element, carbon, in ancient sedimentary rocks.
	''The guiding light in all this is the burial of carbon,'' Dr. Berner said.
	Photosynthesis takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and converts it to oxygen, which is released, and organic matter, which is incorporated in the plant. Plants die and decay and are buried, Dr. Berner said, ''and for every carbon you bury, you leave an oxygen behind.''
	So during the Carboniferous, as plants spread on land, there was less carbon dioxide and more oxygen. Dr. Berner calculated that oxygen concentration reached its peak of about 35 percent 300 million years ago. It declined abruptly at the end of the Permian, about 250 million years ago, a time of the greatest mass extinction in the planet's history. (The cause of the decline, and of the extinctions, is a subject of much debate.)
	To determine whether all that extra oxygen could have led to giant dragonflies and the like, Dr. Harrison, Dr. Dudley and others turn to modern insects.
	Insects ''breathe'' through holes in their bodies, called spiracles, which are attached to hollow tubes, or tracheas.
