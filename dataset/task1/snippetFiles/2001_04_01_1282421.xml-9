	''This guy studies the game more than anybody I've seen,'' Jay Buhner, a Mariners outfielder, said. ''He studies his swing when he's on the airplane. He's got tapes of himself. We used to bust him all the time because he was always watching himself. When we got on the plane to go to another city, he had all his at-bats against the pitchers we'd be facing and he was figuring out what was going on. He's got little tendencies that guys do.''
	Why does Rodriguez consume himself with study? Why did he seek out Bowa that night in Anaheim, a coach on an opposing team?
	''I have a strong need to get better,'' Rodriguez said one recent afternoon in Port Charlotte, Fla. ''I have a monster inside of me. I'm driven. I feel Larry Bowa was one of the best fielders of all time so I felt that a second opinion never hurts from a legend like Larry. Because he's at such a good angle as the third base coach, I thought perhaps he could give me a tip or two that could enhance my game, and it did.
