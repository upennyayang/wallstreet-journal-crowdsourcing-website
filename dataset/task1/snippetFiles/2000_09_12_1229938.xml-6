	Dr. Kwok tested the samples for the presence of H.I.V. and S.I.V., its simian cousin. Dr. Paabo tested for the presence and species origin of two types of DNA. One comes from the nucleus, the other from mitochondria, which generate energy in the cell and are specific to a given species. Dr. Wain-Hobson did both. The labs also tested samples from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Federal agency in Atlanta prepared samples that included old vaccine that it had stored. The tests identified DNA from just one species of primate -- the Asian macaque monkey, not the chimpanzee -- in the Wistar samples, Dr. Basilico told the meeting in London. He said, ''There is nothing in the results to support the theory that H.I.V. entered the human population'' during the polio clinical trials. Even if the scientists had found evidence of a chimpanzee virus in the samples tested, that would not have proved that the virus started the epidemic. One theory is that simian viruses passed to humans in blood-to-blood contact like a cut during the killing of chimpanzees. But if so, it is not known why widespread transmission apparently did not begin until the 1950's.
