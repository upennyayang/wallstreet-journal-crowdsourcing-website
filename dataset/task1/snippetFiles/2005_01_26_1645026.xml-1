	'The Lobotomist' 'A Maverick Medical Genius and His Tragic Quest to Rid the World of Mental Illness' By Jack El-Hai Illustrated. 362 pages. John Wiley &amp; Sons. $27.95. In the summer of 1849, Walt Whitman walked into an office on Nassau Street in Manhattan to have his head read. Lorenzo Niles Fowler, a phrenologist, palpated 35 areas on both sides of the skull corresponding to emotional or intellectual capacities in the brain. Fowler rated each one on a scale of 1 to 7, with 6 representing the ideal (7 meant dangerous excess). Whitman received a perfect score in nearly every one of Fowler's categories, which bore such fanciful names as ''amativeness,'' ''adhesiveness'' and ''combativeness.'' Thrilled with his report card, he became an instant convert to phrenology, defined by Ambrose Bierce as ''the science of picking a man's pocket through the scalp.'' Later he donated his magnificent brain to the American Anthropometric Society, which collected it on his death in 1892 and added it to its collection of elite brains. There are quite a few such collections, scattered around the globe, and Brian Burrell visits all of them in his offbeat scientific tour in ''Postcards From the Brain Museum.''
