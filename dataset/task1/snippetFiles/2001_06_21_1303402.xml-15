	That is the world for which I.B.M. is designing its future high-performance computers, according to Bijan Devari, vice president for technology and emerging products for the computer maker's microelectronics division. ''We're talking about hundreds of millions of devices for this new architecture,'' he said. ''The most advanced stuff is increasingly coming from consumer markets. You can spend vast amounts of capital on things and spread it across hundreds of millions of units.'' The computer maker is thinking of its new design as capable of being used in all sorts of devices, from hand-held and mobile units all the way up through the server market, Dr. Devari said. Known inside the company as the Cell Project, the first new systems are intended to emerge in 2004 and will have clock speeds beginning at four gigahertz, more than twice the speed of today's fastest microprocessors. Dr. Devari said that a single four-processor device intended for the home would have a teraflop of computing power -- a trillion mathematical operations a second. Such a device is likely to sell for several hundred dollars compared with the 8,192-processor ASCI White machine, which cost about $110 million and has computed up to 7.2 teraflops.
