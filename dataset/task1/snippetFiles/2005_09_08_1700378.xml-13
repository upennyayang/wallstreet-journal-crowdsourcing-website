	Unlike the consumption survey, which records only donations, this one has more detail on religious beliefs and activities. (It does not, however, measure gifts.)
	Using religious attendance as their measure of affiliation, the economists get a strikingly different result by race. While whites get no significant ''happiness insurance'' from religious affiliation, blacks get a lot.
	''The median level of religious attendance reduces the happiness impact of income shocks by blacks by about 75 percent,'' they write. The effect is greatest among those with a high school education or less.
	The puzzle, said Professor Dehejia in the interview, is not why blacks benefit but why whites do not. ''Why is it that among whites you see a significant insurance effect on consumption but not on happiness?'' he asked. Perhaps, he speculated, whites feel guilty about the help they get.
	The results are about the same for religious belief as for attendance, since the two are so closely connected. The economists note, however, that attendance matters most. ''Just believing is not sufficient; one needs to participate in a religious organization to get happiness insurance,'' they find.
	As for Hurricane Katrina, Professor Dehejia noted that the disaster had probably disrupted congregations too much for them to provide much financial support.
