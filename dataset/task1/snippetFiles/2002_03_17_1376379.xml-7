	The building also has photovoltaic cells in the skin of the upper floors that convert sunlight directly to electricity. Douglas Durst said the cells were not providing much of the building's power supply now but were demonstrating that such an approach could be a viable source of electricity in the future when more efficient cells have been developed.
	The company has begun excavation for a building on 57th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues that is being designed for use by operators of data centers. Since the structure will be filled with computers and other machines that operate round the clock, it has a flat, constant demand for power. This is in contrast to office buildings that are filled with people and machines that operate during business hours and are largely vacant at night.
	The Dursts have proposed equipping the building with a highly efficient co-generation system that would make tenants independent of the Con Ed distribution system and power suppliers. Nor would they need to incur the expense of leasing additional space and installing generators and fuel storage tanks to guard against the kind of power interruption that occurred in downtown Manhattan after Sept. 11.
