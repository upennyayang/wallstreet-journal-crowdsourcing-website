	There is a symmetry in the relationship between termites and fungi not apparent among the ants. The termites and fungi seem to be completely dependent on each other. Most ants, by contrast, can't live without the fungi, but their crops are very closely related to free-living varieties and may not be completely tied to their farmers. Among certain of the more recently evolved ants, like the leaf-cutters, the dependence is mutual and complete as it is in termites.
	In a commentary, Dr. Ulrich G. Mueller of the University of Texas and Nicole Gerardo, a graduate student at the university, review the variety of ant, beetle and termite farming arrangements and the evolutionary origins of the behavior. In all cases, the relationships between insects and fungi clearly benefit both parties, the definition of symbiosis.
	In termites, they say, the ancestral insects may have already been feeding on fungi, whereas in beetles the link may have begun with the beetles serving the fungi by dispersing spores. With ants, they write, the insect may have been dispersing spores, or have turned to fungi growing in nests as a nearby food source.
