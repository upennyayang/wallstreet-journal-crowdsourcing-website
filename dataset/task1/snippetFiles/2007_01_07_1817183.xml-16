	In other words, you're not O.K., I'm not O.K.. Though as Professor Leslie at the Lighting Research Center has demonstrated, people can't pick out the type of light a lamp is producing without seeing the bulb, seeing skin in its light is a giveaway. Mr. Gordon said: ''Just stick your hand under it. Retail, four-star hotels, restaurants have figured this out. You won't find the Gap using compact fluorescent light bulbs to sell clothes.''
	Mr. Gordon has also worked for the White House. Susan Whitson, press secretary to Laura Bush, said she believed the president and first lady's living quarters were lighted with a combination of incandescent and fluorescent bulbs, depending on the area. She added that Mrs. Bush was a stickler for going around and turning off the lights that weren't being used. (I guess she feels at home.)
	In New York, Jamie Drake, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's decorator, uses compact fluorescent light bulbs in the antique ceramic glazed table lamps in his own personal office on East 62nd Street, but he shades them with custom-made tie-dyed silk chiffon shades with pink silk linings.
