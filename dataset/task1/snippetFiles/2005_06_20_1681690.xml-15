	Of course, the surge of dopamine that thrill seekers search out can literally be addicting. The reason is that anything that activates our reward system, whether it's a natural reinforcer like sex, food or a thrilling act, is seen by the brain as something that should be repeated -- over and over. And despite how smart we think we are, our brain can't really distinguish among the activating effects of drugs, thrill or useful behaviors. Even worse, for some people, drugs and thrill are more powerfully self-reinforcing than even food and sex. So the very design of our brain that promotes survival also makes us vulnerable.
	Alain Robert, aka Spiderman, is known for climbing skyscrapers without special equipment or a safety net. He recently climbed the Taipei 101 Tower in Taiwan, which, standing at 1,670 feet, is the world's tallest building. ''The euphoria when I reach the summit maybe lasts a few hours or days at the most, and then I have to have it again,'' he said. ''I enjoy the risk and to be in control of my fear and have to do it again and again. I cannot stop climbing.''
