	Asked if it showed that a plane could not penetrate a dome, he said, ''We've been trying like heck to shoot down this rumor.''
	Mr. German said: ''That test was designed to measure the impact force of a fighter jet. But the wall was not being tested. No structure was being tested.''
	The nuclear experts contend that the test makes their point nevertheless. The opponents of nuclear power have argued that the plane in the Sandia test, an F-4 Phantom, weighs far less than a jumbo jet.
	But James Muckerheide, a nuclear engineer who is the co-director of the Center for Nuclear Technology and Society at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, on whose work the authors relied, said in an e-mail response to a reporter's question that penetrating a reactor containment building would take far more than an airliner. Compared with the F-4, Mr. Muckerheide said, ''a large passenger aircraft is a slow, empty, tin can.''
	''The mass of the aircraft can put a heavy compression load on the containment structure,'' he said, ''but it has negligible penetrating ability.''
	The containment building can withstand huge compression loads, he argued.
