	Another machine, called the ice chiller, cools a fluid similar to automotive antifreeze to 18 degrees Fahrenheit and circulates the fluid through tubes inside 28 tanks of water, which freezes at about 32 degrees. It is important for the water to be converted from the liquid to solid state, because ice has much greater cooling capacity than chilled water.
	When the ice plant is called on to operate, the antifreeze is used to start melting the ice to cool the water that circulates throughout the building providing air-conditioning -- the ice chiller is not to be turned on for this purpose.
	The house chiller provides the base load cooling for the building, about 700 tons of it (a ton of cooling is the equivalent of 12,000 B.T.U.'s). The tanks of ice are designed to handle an additional 350 tons of cooling, without consuming any more electricity than is needed to run a few circulation pumps.
	To make room for the ice tanks, the Dursts removed two conventional cooling machines in the building's mechanical room and built a mezzanine level in the room to accommodate the insulated tanks that are connected with a web of piping.
