	The Grimsley affidavit, dated May 31, 2006 -- five and a half months after the Radomski affidavit -- stated that Grimsley had used performance-enhancing drugs like human growth hormone, amphetamines and the anabolic steroid named clenbuterol, one of the drugs that Radomski said he had sold once a go-between in baseball had set him up with many of his clients.
	The affidavit also stated that Grimsley told investigators about former and current players who had used performance-enhancing drugs.
	There are some similarities between the two affidavits. Both mention virtually the same drugs, both list payments in similar price increments and both have many names of professional baseball players whose names are redacted.
	Grimsley's agent, Joe Bick, said Saturday that Grimsley had never given up names of players who had used drugs, but that federal agents had offered him names of possible users. ''They had a list and asked him about the players; he never volunteered names,'' said Bick, via telephone, who added that federal investigators had not contacted Grimsley since they raided his home last summer.
	One question is whether the names in the Grimsley affidavit were first offered by Radomski.
