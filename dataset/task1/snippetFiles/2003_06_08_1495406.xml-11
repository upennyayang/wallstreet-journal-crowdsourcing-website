	It took me a second or two to decide whether or not I was. If I said ''no,'' where would that lead? To hours of chatting all the way to the top of Crazy Horse's skull? ''Yes,'' I said. ''It's a lovely day for a walk. Much better weather over here.'' I gave her a warm, half-deflecting smile and moved on briskly up the path.
	After an hour and a half of climbing, I took a lunch break on a fallen tree. Just as I was finishing, I heard a voice: ''Oh, there's that English guy. Do you mind if we share your log?'' The woman and her husband sat down beside me. I hadn't noticed him at the ticket booth; he walked with a white cane. The couple explained that they tried to do the hike every year. I was impressed: the trail was steep and rough.
	''What brings you here from England?''
	''Well, actually I don't live there any more. I live in Madison, Wis.'' It emerged that I taught at the university. ''What department?'' English.
	''You must know our daughter then. She's a graduate student in your department.''
