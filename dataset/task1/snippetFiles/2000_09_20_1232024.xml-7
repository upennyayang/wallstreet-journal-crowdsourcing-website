	It is sort of like visiting several stores, but only going into one. This seemed particularly alluring because we were stuck in the convention hall, close to lots of hot air but nowhere near a good shopping mall.
	''Neat!'' Katie said.
	Personally, I was wondering whether bots could still be as worthless as the last time I tried them.
	Bots were all the rage last Christmas, hyped by the technology media at every turn, jamming the airwaves with commercials, but they seemed like vaporware to me -- overpromoted and underperforming. The bots I had tried were cluttered and unfriendly and usually produced too much information, all of which turned out to be worthless.
	I also wondered, as I often did with the Internet, how bots could ever be a viable business. To be of any use to a consumer, they had to scan as many sites as possible, and surely not every site would pay for the referral. So how did I know I could trust the information I was getting from a bot?
	The theory behind the technology was great, but the reality was a different matter. A bot did not necessarily give you unbiased, comprehensive information.
