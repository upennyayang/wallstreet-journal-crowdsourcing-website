	Earlier prototypes also used superconducting magnets -- which themselves have to be chilled to very low temperatures -- to generate the magnetic field.
	In the latest prototype, the scientists fashioned a permanent magnet that generates a field nearly as strong.
	''This is getting closer to a real machine that you put in a real device,'' said Dr. Karl A. Gschneidner Jr., a senior metallurgist at the Ames Laboratory in Iowa, who has been working on the prototypes with colleagues at Ames and a company, the Astronautics Corporation of America in Milwaukee.
	The use of a permanent magnet is ''definitely a nice advance,'' said Dr. Robert D. Shull, leader of the magnetic materials group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. But Dr. Shull said he wanted to know more details.
	''I don't know what the efficiency of it is,'' he said. ''That's one of the critical numbers one needs to know whether it can be commercialized.''
	There is still room for improvement.
	In an article published in the journal Nature last month, scientists at the University of Amsterdam reported that they had created an iron-based compound that also exhibits a large warming effect in a magnetic field.
