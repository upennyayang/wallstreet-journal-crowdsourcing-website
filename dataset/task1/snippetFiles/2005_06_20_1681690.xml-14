	Probably not, judging from studies of Dr. Jerome Kagan at Harvard, who has shown that certain temperamental traits you are born with are pretty stable. Using M.R.I. brain scanning, Dr. Carl Schwartz at Harvard recently found that these anxious adults showed greater responses in the amygdala, a brain region that processes fearful and threatening stimuli, to faces of strangers than to familiar faces. In other words, people who like novelty have biologically different brains than cautious folks, and no one knows if experience changes this.
	Of course, the surge of dopamine that thrill seekers search out can literally be addicting. The reason is that anything that activates our reward system, whether it's a natural reinforcer like sex, food or a thrilling act, is seen by the brain as something that should be repeated -- over and over. And despite how smart we think we are, our brain can't really distinguish among the activating effects of drugs, thrill or useful behaviors. Even worse, for some people, drugs and thrill are more powerfully self-reinforcing than even food and sex. So the very design of our brain that promotes survival also makes us vulnerable.
