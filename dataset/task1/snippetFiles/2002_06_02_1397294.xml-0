	JONES MURPHY might not have noticed what his colleagues at the Williams Companies were doing if they had not been gloating. Mr. Murphy, previously a Wall Street executive, had recently been hired as the director of emerging products at Williams's headquarters in Tulsa, Okla., to help manage its trading risks. He was on the company's trading floor when he heard a commotion at the desk of Blake Herndon, director of risk management. ''I went over to ask what was going on,'' Mr. Murphy recalled of that day in December 2000. ''Blake laughed and said they were going to corner the market for natural gas and run it up for December closing, which means delivery in January.'' Williams is the second-largest owner of natural gas pipelines in the country, and Mr. Murphy, who is no longer with the company, says he thinks that an examination of trading records would show that the company succeeded in driving up natural gas prices in California. Executives at Williams dismissed the allegation as impossible. Mr. Herndon said: ''It is comical to think that anyone could corner the gas market in California. I think this shows the lack of understanding of how these markets work.
