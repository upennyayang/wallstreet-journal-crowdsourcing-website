	A report released Friday by the American Institute of Physics offers a contradictory conclusion: after they earn a bachelor's degree in physics, American women are just as successful as men at wending their way up the academic ladder.
	Physics continues to be the most male-dominated field among the sciences. Men hold 90 percent of physics faculty positions, and earned 82 percent of the doctoral degrees in 2003.
	''I'm not saying it was easy for women,'' said Dr. Rachel Ivie, a sociologist and an author of the report. But she said her statistics showed no indication of discrimination in the hiring of female physicists -- supporting one of Dr. Summers's points -- or women dropping out of the field at a higher rate than men, countering what Dr. Summers had offered as the most important reason there are fewer women in science and engineering.
	Dr. Summers had asked, ''What fraction of young women in their mid-20's make a decision that they don't want to have a job that they think about 80 hours a week?'' and answered his own question: ''That has got to be a large part of what is observed.''
