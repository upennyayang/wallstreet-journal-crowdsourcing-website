	Ms. Enck said that it was difficult for her to consider joining government after so many years of criticizing it, but that she found that she could work for Mr. Spitzer, who came to public office without the baggage that weighs down most elected officials.
	Because Mr. Spitzer used family wealth to finance most of his campaign, she said, ''he's the first statewide elected official I know who is beholden to no one.''
	Since the spring, the list of environmental cases has steadily grown. Many were referred by the Department of Environmental Conservation -- the traditional means by which environmental violations are prosecuted by the state -- but Mr. Spitzer has also been pursuing leads and building cases on his own as well.
	They range from small-scale attacks on companies that are believed to have polluted neighborhoods to wide-ranging forays against the giant energy companies whose coal-fired plants are thought to contribute to the sterilization of Adirondack lakes and the smog that cloaks much of the state each summer.
	The environmental bureau also dusted off a rarely used legal weapon -- public nuisance laws -- to go after some companies that were creating chronic pollution problems.
