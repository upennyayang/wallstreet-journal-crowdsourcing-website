	Specifically, they write in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, hydrogen could be stored in a network of frozen water molecules that has a crystalline structure, known as a clathrate. Gas molecules are trapped in cavities within the crystal and help stabilize it. Clathrates, also known as gas hydrates, occur in nature, under the seafloor and in Arctic permafrost, for instance, where they trap immense amounts of methane. But the researchers synthesized their own, using hydrogen as the trapped gas. The researchers found that their clathrate could exist at about minus 320 degrees under normal pressure. Then, when the clathrate was warmed to about minus 200, the hydrogen would be released. Minus 320 degrees might not seem like much of an improvement over minus 425, but in fact a clathrate at the higher temperature could be kept cold through the use of liquid nitrogen. The researchers say that much more work remains -- for one thing, other clathrates may be more effective -- but that the approach is promising.
