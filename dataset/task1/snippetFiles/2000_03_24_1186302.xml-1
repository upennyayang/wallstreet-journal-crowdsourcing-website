	The warming of the deep oceans had long been predicted, and the consequent delaying effect long thought to exist. But until now the ocean's heat absorption had not been definitively demonstrated, and its magnitude had not been determined. The finding, by scientists at the National Oceanographic Data Center in Silver Spring, Md., is based on an analysis of 5.1 million measurements, by instruments around the world, of the top two miles of ocean waters from the mid-1950's to the mid-1990's. The analysis, the first on a global scale, is being published today in the journal Science. As the earth warms, from either natural or human causes, or both, not all the extra heat goes immediately into the atmosphere, where its effect on climate is most direct. Much of it is absorbed by the oceans, which store it for years or decades before releasing it. This means that to whatever extent the planet is being warmed by emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which are produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, only part of that heating has materialized so far at and above the earth's surface.
