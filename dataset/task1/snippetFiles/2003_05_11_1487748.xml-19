	In the early 1990's, Dealler learned that a chemical called pentosan polysulphate, or PPS -- which is used to treat bladder inflammation -- had shown some effectiveness against scrapie, a prion disease that affects animals very much as mad cow does. Researchers showed that if an animal was given PPS before, or very soon after infection -- the timing would prove to be significant -- it could prevent the disease from taking hold. Dealler and his colleagues showed that the drug was similarly effective against variant C.J.D. His data, however, was limited to test tubes.
	Stephen Dealler received his first phone call from Don Simms in January 2002. Don had read Dealler's papers and wanted to try PPS on his son. As Dealler told him, however, there was a daunting technical challenge. PPS molecules were so big that if they were administered by any of the standard means -- intravenously, or in a pill -- they would not be able to pass from the bloodstream into the brain. ''We have no way to deliver it,'' Dealler remembers saying. He wished Don well and thought that would be the last he would hear from him.
	Weeks later, Don called again.
