	BASEBALL is America's great secular religion, a collection of mythologies that reflect who we are and who we aspire to be. The game's most enduring myth, of course, is its immaculate conception on a Cooperstown, N.Y., street in 1839. Who invented baseball? For nearly a century, the axiomatic answer to that question has been Abner Doubleday, though that belief was discredited almost as soon as it was first made public, in 1908. What's more, as David Block reveals in ''Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game,'' America's pastime was not born in America, and legitimate claims to its origin can be made by a handful of nations, including -- of all places -- France.
	While the Doubleday myth was never taken seriously by historians, Block reveals that the gospel that supplanted it was also deeply flawed.
	Where, then, did baseball come from? In search of an answer, Block, a retired systems analyst and an antiquarian book collector, has attacked baseball's literary record with methodical zeal.
