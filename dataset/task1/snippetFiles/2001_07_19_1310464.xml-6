	On the Fenway infield, Mr. Mellor leaned down to demonstrate the basics of expressive groundskeeping. You push the blades of grass away from you, he said, doing just that, and the long stalks reflect the sun to create a bright surface; push the grass toward you, and the bristly tips bury the sunlight in their shadows, creating a darker field. He used his hand to illustrate the velvet effect, though on the field, his crew uses a heavy roller, either built into the mower or attached behind. Using these two shades he has been able to treat the field, he said, ''as a canvas.''
	Mr. Mellor switches patterns every two weeks, cutting and touching up the design daily; if he kept a pattern longer, the turf might settle into a permanent texture, which could alter the roll of the ball. He gets ideas from sweater patterns, tile catalogs, quilts, what have you, he said. Some he makes up on the computer.
	One of his most vividly psychedelic designs -- an array of wavy lines radiating from the pitcher's mound like the legs of a giant octopus -- came from his daughter Cacky, who drew it for a second-grade project.
