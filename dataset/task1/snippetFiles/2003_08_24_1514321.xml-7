	Considering that the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees lived only 5 to 6 million years ago, human evolution seems to have been quite rapid. The chimp, our closest living relative, is still a standard ape, whereas we have become a truly weird one. And our evolution put on an extra spurt just 50,000 years ago, the date when we may have perfected language, made our first objets d'art and dispersed from our ancestral homeland some place in northeast Africa.
	Despite the medical advances and creature comforts that shelter people in rich countries, natural selection is still hard at work. Microbes and parasites still nip at our heels, forcing the human genome to stay in constant motion. It is clearly in the throes of adapting to malaria, a disease that seems to have struck only in the last 8,000 years, and the protective gene that has sickle cell anemia as a side effect is a sign of a hasty patch.
	It seems reasonable to predict that the human physical form will stay in equilibrium with its surroundings. If the ozone layer thins, pale skins will be out and dark skins de rigeur.
