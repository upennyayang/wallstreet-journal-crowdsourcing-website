	Scientists at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and other centers have shown a rise in photosynthesis over two years at a hardwood forest and have tied it to increased scattering of light. The scattering was linked to the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which sent huge amounts of light-scattering sulfur aerosols into the air.
	The researchers, who reported on their work in the March 28 issue of Science, used data from the Harvard Forest, an experimental tract in central Massachusetts. Comparing data from cloudless days in 1992 and 1993 to cloudless days in later years (when the aerosol effect of the Pinatubo eruption had dissipated), they estimated that noontime photosynthesis increased by 23 percent in 1992 and by 8 percent in 1993.
	Because increased photosynthesis results in increased absorption of carbon dioxide, the researchers say their findings suggest that the greater light scattering caused by Pinatubo contributed to a measured decline in the rate of growth of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the two years that followed.
	A Rare Killing
	With few natural predators, cougars and wolves usually leave each other alone.
	The cougar was outfitted with a radio collar so its movements could be tracked.
