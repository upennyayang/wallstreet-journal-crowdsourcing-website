	The travel industry is helping to push consumers toward computers and Internet services. Last month, Delta Air Lines imposed a $2 round-trip surcharge on domestic tickets not purchased through its Web site. (The surcharge, sharply criticized by travel agents, was withdrawn two weeks later.) In a slight variation, American Airlines, to name one, occasionally gives discounts on tickets purchased via computer. Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air recently imposed a $10 surcharge for mailing paper tickets. Other airlines have been studying similar inducements, to the consternation of travel agents and some travelers without Internet access.
	The airlines contend that the shift to Internet reservations and ticketing will help them cut costs by reducing staff and increasing productivity, although such pronouncements often do not mention the need to hire more highly paid programmers and Web designers. The Internet offers the airlines, which have been cutting commissions to travel agents in recent years, a way to further reduce commissions and the cost of distributing tickets. In any event, Delta announced record profits the week after imposing the surcharges.
	Depending on whom one asks and how one counts, travel is the biggest, or one of the biggest, categories of spending by on-line consumers.
