	Gallo nonetheless publicly disparaged the French team's research, insisting that Montagnier's viral samples could not be grown in culture and hence were virtually useless for research. As late as February 1984, Gallo was still asserting that HTLV or a variant was the ''only candidate'' for the virus that causes AIDS. A few months later, he announced that he had discovered a variant of HTLV, called HTLV-3B, in patients with AIDS. Other researchers pointed out that HTLV-3B had little in common with HTLV; in fact, HTLV-3B turned out to be strikingly similar to LAV, the French virus Gallo slighted.
	There were several possible interpretations of this situation. The simplest was that Gallo independently discovered the same virus the French had. By the mid-1980's, however, researchers established that the AIDS virus mutates so rapidly that specimens extracted from different patients will always have diverged genetically. Some researchers said the viruses described by Gallo and Montagnier were so similar they must have come from the same patient or the same laboratory flask.
	Gallo initially denied that his virus and the French virus were the same.
	Meanwhile, both the Pasteur Institute and Gallo's team applied for patents for a test that could detect the virus.
