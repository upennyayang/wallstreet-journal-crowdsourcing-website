	Sometime, perhaps about 50 million years ago, farming was invented. Not by human beings of course, but by ants, termites and beetles, each of which developed forms of fungi gardening. Previous studies have tracked the molecular evolution of ants and beetles. The tools used, statistical analyses of genetic variation, are the same ones that have produced the claim, widely but not completely accepted, that human beings are all descended from a single female ancestor in Africa -- called Eve, of course -- about 150,000 years ago. Researchers have found Eves and Adams among the ants and beetles as well. Farming appears to have evolved only once among the ants, suggesting one founding pair, although the descendant farmers have domesticated new varieties of fungi several times. In contrast, farming appears to have evolved at least seven different times among the beetles. Now a European research group has turned its attention to fungus-farming termites, which have been less well studied. What they have found is an out-of-Africa story in which termites and fungi joined together once and have not separated since. It was, apparently, the beginning of a beautiful symbiosis.
