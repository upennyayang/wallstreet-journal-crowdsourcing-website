	In a 1997 PET scan study of murderers, for example, Dr. Raine and his colleagues found abnormalities in the functioning of the prefrontal cortex compared with a group of control subjects. And Dr. Antonio Damasio, chairman of neurology at the University of Iowa College of Medicine, and his colleagues have demonstrated that patients with injuries to certain parts of the frontal lobe often begin to exhibit antisocial behavior, becoming irresponsible, untrustworthy and inappropriate in social situations.
	In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Damasio called the findings ''persuasive.'' But the results, he added, should not be construed to mean that antisocial behavior is ''located'' in the frontal lobe, but rather that the role of the prefrontal cortex is part of a complex neural system involving many brain regions.
	Dr. Robert Hare, a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia and the author of ''Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us,'' said the new study was potentially important.
	But he said that in his view, true psychopaths are a subset of those diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, a category he believes is so broad its utility is limited.
