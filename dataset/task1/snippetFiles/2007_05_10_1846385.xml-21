	The database would also make it easier for patients to learn of clinical trials testing drugs that could save their lives. Mr. Enzi said the bill could speed the approval of new drugs, by giving the agency more tools to protect patients after treatments had been approved. The agency would no longer have to rely on ''the nuclear option, which is pulling a drug completely off the market,'' an extreme step that may disrupt patients' care, Mr. Enzi said. The agency could instead require a manufacturer to adopt a ''risk evaluation and mitigation strategy'' for a drug that posed serious risks. As part of a risk-management plan, the agency could require that any television or radio advertisements for a drug describe its risks ''in a clear and conspicuous neutral manner,'' with fines for false or misleading commercials. To make that sure patients could have access to drugs with extraordinary risks like thalidomide, for a type of cancer, and Tysabri, for multiple sclerosis, the drug agency could require additional precautions like special training for doctors and close monitoring of patients. Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, said any restrictions on using or marketing a drug would have to be based on ''sound science.''
