	Although such work may seem inconsequential or boring to some outsiders, he said, it has its own special feeling of urgency. ''To keep up with the latest pulse of the planet in a warming world is quite exciting, similar to watching the charts of an unstable patient in the emergency room of a hospital,'' Dr. Keeling said.
	Trends in the Arctic so far have been reflected in readings of sea ice thickness and the area it covers, taken by satellites and nuclear submarines.
	While satellites have helped track increasing summer retreats of the ice over three decades, they cannot reveal the temperature, salinity and currents of the layered ocean below.
	Declassified information collected by submarines has shown that the ice has also been thinning but the data are limited to corridors used in the cold war.
	Glaring gaps persist in the data, and as a result scientists have had difficulty putting the recent big changes in air, ice and ocean conditions in the far north into context.
	The team that sets up what it calls the North Pole Environmental Observatory each spring is content to add one new data point each year to the big picture, right near the North Pole.
