	According to an accompanying article in Physics Today, by the magazine's editor, Peter Rodgers, it wasn't until 1961 that someone (Claus Jönsson of Tübingen) carried out the experiment in the real world.
	By that time no one was really surprised by the outcome, and the report, like most, was absorbed anonymously into science. (Ranking: 1)
	Correction: September 27, 2002, Friday An article in Science Times on Tuesday about the experiments selected by physicists as the 10 most beautiful in history referred incorrectly at one point to the magazine edited by Peter Rodgers, which first printed the list. It is Physics World, not Physics Today.
	A painting with the article, identified as an image of Henry Cavendish, was published in error. It showed another 18th-century scientist, Joseph Priestley, who did not figure in the list.
	Correction: October 7, 2002, Monday An article in Science Times on Sept. 24 about physicists' selections of the 10 most beautiful experiments misstated a portion of Newton's theory of gravity, cited in a discussion of Cavendish's torsion-bar experiment. Newton held that the strength of attraction between two objects increases with the product of their masses, not with the square of their masses.
