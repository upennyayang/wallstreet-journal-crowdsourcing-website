	A larger study published in 1998 by Dr. Hunt and David Waller, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and financed by the Office of Naval Research found striking differences in how well men and women can be trained to navigate a real-life maze by learning in a computer-simulated model.
	The study tested equal numbers of men and women; of those who got completely lost (that is, were pointing in the opposite direction of where they should go), 17 were women and only one was a man.
	''Most women were all right, but some women were in big trouble,'' Dr. Hunt said. ''The empirical facts are pretty clear, and the explanations are very murky. It's our job to find out why and make it better. What that might mean is that if the women have more practice, they'll be fine.''
	In the latest study, the research focused on smaller sample groups of university students and included controls to minimize any skewing related to proficiency with a joystick, a factor thought to work to the advantage of boys, who are more likely to have been raised on video games.
