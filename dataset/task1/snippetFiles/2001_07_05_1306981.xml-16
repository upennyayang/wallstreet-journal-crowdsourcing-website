	Mr. Champion said that Mr. Joyce of I.B.M. is a hot commodity because of his experience with that company's revamping under its chairman, Louis V. Gerstner Jr. That background would be useful at a company like Lucent, he added. Technology companies are the ones searching, and technology executives are in most demand. Still, knowledge of a company's industry is less important than having coped with adversity, said Randy Curran, the chief executive of I.C.G. Communications, which is working through bankruptcy proceedings. Mr. Curran previously oversaw the revamping of Thermadyne Holdings, a St. Louis-based manufacturer of welding products, in bankruptcy proceedings. ''A really good industry guy who has not been a C.E.O. for a long time or who has not managed a troubled environment is not going to be able to make the decisions'' about layoffs and spending cuts that are necessary to keep a company afloat when losses mount, he said. Of course, those who have worked at a company on the brink are often not eager to put that experience to use by jumping into another one. It is exhausting, executives say, and harder than ever because markets are much quicker to punish those who fail.
