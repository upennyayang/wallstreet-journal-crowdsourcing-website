	Jenny Dickson, a wildlife biologist with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, called the current Audubon survey ''more important than it looks on the surface,'' because it covers not only birds, but the health of the habitat. ''It gives us a whole block of information; it helps us to improve our management.''
	The regional aspect of the survey will enable states to work together better, she said, and she welcomes the plan to organize volunteers to carry out long-term monitoring that her department -- like others elsewhere -- simply couldn't afford.
	Mr. Shriver also noted that it's necessary to have baseline information on hand if an environmental disaster occurs. New England's coastal marshes, he said, are ''in a direct line'' for oil spills.
	Ms. Pendergast, he said, is definitely the person to lead the Connecticut survey, because she's ''a first-rate birder'' with many connections to the birding community, which he hopes is source of volunteer monitors. Ms. Pendergast, 45, is a a lifelong birder and vice president of the Connecticut Ornithological Association. She is a former lobbyist for the National Audubon Society. Mr. Robbins, 35, is a graduate student at Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.
