	One evening, we anchored off the coast of Floreana for a barbecue supper on the rear deck. There was a full moon, a dome of unfamiliar stars and not a single airplane. Crew members took their cell phones to the top deck and called home. Schools of fish gathered in a pool of light at the stern, and every now and then a lone gull swooped in the shadows like a bat, skirting the light. ''Ghost gulls,'' the panguero said.
	By day, I walked the islands or lay in a hammock reading ''The Voyage of the Beagle'' or, when we came to a place that was, as Dora said, ''snorkable,'' I snorkeled. The first time my body slipped from the panga into that cold water, my heart nearly quit -- and it didn't help that just then someone shouted, ''Hammerhead!'' It turned out that the cry was not a warning, it was an exclamation of joy. Everyone but me was eager to snorkle with sharks. I was happier with the sea lions, who were less scary than sharks and less aloof than boobies.
	And now I'll tell the very kind of animal story I usually dislike, the kind that proves animals do love us.
