	Harold Pachios, a lawyer in Portland, Me., and friend of Mitchell's, read what I had written and informed me, via an e-mail message, that Mitchell was ''for a long time a federal prosecutor who investigated scores of criminal cases and tried those criminal cases.''
	Before his work on the federal level, Pachios wrote, Mitchell was ''a state prosecutor who prosecuted criminals for years.'' He did all of that before he went into politics and became a United States senator from Maine.
	Mitchell cross-examined Oliver North in the Iran-contra affair and, more recently, led the United States Olympic Committee investigation of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.
	In other words, the man is no stranger to the world of criminal investigation, which is good for the role Selig has asked him to perform. But Mitchell is also a director of the Boston Red Sox -- not an owner, but a director -- and the chairman of the Walt Disney Company.
	Those two positions have raised a question about a conflict of interest for Mitchell. Selig rejected the thought. ''He has impeccable credentials,'' Selig said yesterday in his office after the news conference.
	Mitchell also rejected the idea.
