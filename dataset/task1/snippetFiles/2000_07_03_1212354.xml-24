	The Endangered Species Act includes miles of wiggle room on this point, containing no clear guidance on how much of a species' original range needs to be restored before it is declared saved.
	A recent draft of the proposal was provided to a reporter by someone outside the Fish and Wildlife Service. Officials at the agency said almost all of the draft's major points would be reflected in the final version.
	Under the plan, wolf habitat in the lower 48 states would be divided into four regions, with separate recovery plans for each.
	The western Great Lakes region would encompass Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota and South Dakota. The western region would be Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and parts of northern New Mexico and Arizona.
	The southwestern region, the only one where wolves would remain endangered, would include some parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Texas.
	The northeastern region would be New York, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine. Wolves have not been seen in the Adirondacks in 100 years and only two possible sightings have been made in Maine, which is considered the likeliest spot for any future reintroduction effort.
