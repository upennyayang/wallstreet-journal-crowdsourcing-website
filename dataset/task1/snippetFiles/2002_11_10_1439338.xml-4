	A security guard who never heard of Nikola Tesla turned away visitors on a recent afternoon. The property, he said, was unused and sealed shut while the owners decided what to do with it.
	Hanging in the balance, Tesla historians and preservationist said, is the fate of the last intact Tesla workplace anywhere in the world and a gem of Long Island history too long left in the rough.
	''This is an extremely important landmark,'' said Barbara Van Liew, an architectural historian from St. James. ''By all means, it should be preserved. Tesla invented a lot of the things we use today, and he doesn't get much credit.''
	In perfecting the alternating-current power system now used around the world, Tesla prevailed over Thomas Edison, who believed in an inferior direct-current system and strove in vain to prove that alternating current was unsafe.
	It was Tesla, not Marconi, who invented radio. He also harnessed Niagara Falls for hydropower and invented, among many other things, a bladeless steam turbine, the first remote-controlled torpedoes and devices that had applications in missile defense and computers, long after his death in 1943.
