	But Celera would not put its data in GenBank, saying it feared that other companies, including its competitors, could simply take the fruits of its work free, even annotating and selling the entire human genome sequence. ''The bottom line,'' Dr. Samuel Broder, Celera's executive vice president for medical affairs, said, ''is that we want to make sure that the work and considerable effort is put to the benefit of the people who took the risk to invest in Celera. Therefore, we don't want to set up a system where other database providers can repackage the data and sell it on their own.'' And companies that want to use the data for commercial purposes, Dr. Broder said, ''should bear their fair share of the cost.'' Other companies have declined to publish commercially valuable genetic sequence data, not writing papers at all, and selling the data instead. ''We're trying to run a business here, not put things in Science magazine,'' said Roy Whitfield, the chief executive of Incyte Genomics, a company in Palo Alto, Calif., that has genetic sequences of individual human genes. But the human genome sequence papers were widely thought to be of historic importance, scientists said.
