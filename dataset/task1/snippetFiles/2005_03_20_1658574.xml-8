	But others lament that a performance-enhanced society is giving in to a culture that prizes the achievement over the journey. Many Americans already get that message from a young age, said Denise Clark Pope, author of ''Doing School: How We Are Creating a Generation of Stressed Out, Materialistic and Miseducated Students.''
	When surveys ask students which is more important, to be honorable and get a low grade or to cheat and get a high grade, she said, more students choose the A. ''The parents will say 'no, no, no,' but the message they're sending says the opposite.''
	The use of performance enhancing drugs reflects a society where stress and striving have become the national pastime. Ms. Pope calls it the ''credentialism society,'' exemplified in her book through a high school student who describes life as a quest to get the best grades, so you can get into the best college, so you can get into the best graduate school, so you can get the highest-paying job, which brings you happiness.
	So where people once took illegal drugs like cocaine to escape or stimulate creativity, they now take legal drugs to focus better and achieve more.
