	Robert George Will, director of Britain's C.J.D. Surveillance Unit, agreed. ''Although it could be argued that there is little to lose in this tragic situation,'' he wrote, ''my personal view is that there is a significant risk of causing pain or distress if the treatment is given and very little prospect of any benefit.''
	Medicine is a constant trade-off, a struggle to cure the disease without killing the patient first. Chemotherapy, for example, involves purposely poisoning someone -- but with the expectation that the short-term injury will be outweighed by the eventual benefits. First, do no harm, Hippocrates told his students, but it's not always easy to define ''harm.'' Arthur Caplan argues that in cases like this one, when unproved drugs are given to desperate patients for what is called ''compassionate use,'' the harm may include false hope. ''It has never worked,'' he says of such last-ditch efforts. ''I don't know of any case where it has worked. And human experimentation should not be done on the dying just because they are dying.''
	Don, on the other hand, says the greater harm would be denying Jonathan any hope at all.
