	For his part, Mr. Spitzer said in an interview that his pollution-fighting efforts and those of Mr. Pataki ''fit together wonderfully.''
	''If there is some element of competition -- and I don't see it that way,'' Mr. Spitzer said, ''well, look, it's generating great policy.''
	Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the Governor, declined to comment other than to say that Mr. Pataki and Mr. Spitzer were working ''pretty well'' together.
	From his first days in office last January, Mr. Spitzer seemed intent on pursuing environmental cases. In contrast, Mr. Vacco had been criticized by environmental groups for mainly taking on an environmental case only after it had been referred for prosecution by lawyers at the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
	A few days after he took office, Mr. Spitzer met with the environmental staff, encouraging its members to think creatively and try to bring new kinds of cases against polluters. ''At the Environmental Protection Bureau, there was a palpable sense of relief, a feeling that limitations were being taken off,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''I said we are here to bring the cases you can conjure, cases that will perhaps push the law, that will test new theories of our ability to be interventionist.''
