	Dr. Remington was born in Reedville, Va., in 1922, to Maud and P. Sheldon Remington, a school headmaster. Charles spent his boyhood chasing butterflies alongside his father, also a collector. He studied biology at Principia College and then parlayed his World War II military service into a bug-finding mission, serving as a medical entomologist in the Pacific.
	During his graduate studies at Harvard, he founded the Lepidopterists' Society with an equally butterfly-smitten undergraduate, Harry Clench. What began as a party of two is today an organization of about 1,500 members from more than 50 countries. The folksy newsletter the young men wrote is now the historic first issue of the international scientific publication known as the Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society.
	At Harvard, Dr. Remington also began his friendship with Vladimir Nabokov, a serious amateur lepidopterist. Dr. Remington was a kindred spirit who understood the joy of a particular catch, what Nabokov once referred to as a ''fellow sufferer.''
	In 1948, Dr. Remington began teaching at Yale, where with his bolo ties he cut a colorful figure among more buttoned-down colleagues.
	He often told his students of how, while stationed in the Philippines, he was awakened from sleep by ''a fiery pain'' in his armpit.
