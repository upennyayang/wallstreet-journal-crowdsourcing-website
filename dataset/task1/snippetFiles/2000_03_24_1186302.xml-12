	Three years ago, Dr. Hansen and colleagues used a computer model to calculate the amount of warming that should have been produced up till then by external influences on the climate system like greenhouse gases and solar radiation. They found that because of the storage of heat in the ocean, only about half the surface warming should have appeared. Mr. Levitus and his fellow researchers say in their paper that their findings support the Hansen conclusion.
	Still, Mr. Levitus said the cause of the oceanic warming was not clear, although ''I believe personally that some of it is due to greenhouse gases.''
	Some scientists believe that natural factors like recurring oscillations in ocean surface temperature in various parts of the world may play a role in the last century's warming. For example, studies by Dr. Gerard Bond of Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory found that the climate of the North Atlantic region, at least, had alternated between cooler and warmer every 1,500 years, more or less.
	The world may be entering one of the natural warming cycles now, say Dr. Bond and Dr. Charles D. Keeling, a climate expert at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego.
