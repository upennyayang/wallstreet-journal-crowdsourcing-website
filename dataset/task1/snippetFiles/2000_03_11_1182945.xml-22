	Dr. Steve Abrams, a veterinarian and member of the Kansas school board who voted to change the state's standards, said the survey's overall results ''would seem to be consistent'' with opinion in Kansas.
	But he objected to a question asking respondents' opinion of the Kansas board's action, saying it did not describe the action accurately.
	The question said the board had voted ''to delete evolution from their new state science standards'' and asked respondents if they supported or opposed that action.
	But, Dr. Abrams said: ''What we did was to allow local boards of education to decide how they want to deal with evolution. We did not encourage the teaching of creationism at all.''
	A researcher at DYG said that while the question necessarily condensed a complex and divisive issue into a short sentence for the survey, the firm stood behind the wording as impartial and accurate.
	The answers to that Kansas question seemed to indicate that most Americans disagreed with the board's decision. While praising the survey in general, Dr. David W. Moore of The Gallup Poll also maintained that the Kansas question was poorly worded.
