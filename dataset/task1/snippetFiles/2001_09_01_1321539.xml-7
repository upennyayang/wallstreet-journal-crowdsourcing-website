	''If you're interested in what role the church played in making the Holocaust possible,'' Mr. Kertzer said in a telephone interview, ''it's decades and decades of demonization of Jews.''
	In the book's introduction, he attacks the Vatican's 1998 statement on the Holocaust, arguing that the distinction it draws between the church's historic anti-Judaism, defined as ''longstanding sentiments of mistrust and hostility'' and Nazi anti-Semitism, ''based on theories contrary to the constant teaching of the church on the unity of the human race'' is not supported by the facts. He writes, ''If the Vatican never approved the extermination of the Jews -- indeed, the Vatican opposed it (albeit quietly), the teachings and actions of the church, including those of the popes themselves, helped make it possible.''
	Reached by telephone, a Vatican spokesman declined to comment on the book, saying that he had not read it. But scholars who have say its publication is a significant event. ''It's an important book,'' said Michael Marrus, a historian at the University of Toronto who was one of three Jewish scholars on the Vatican panel that disbanded last month.
