	Louis's mouth, Dr. Tepper also noted, was so infected he couldn't close it. Since fish feed by suction, Louis couldn't eat. The koi had lost half a pound from his three-and-a-half-pound frame. Dr. Tepper transported his patient in a water-filled bucket back to his above-ground tanks in a greenhouse at his Long Island Fish Hospital and injected antibiotics into Louis's abdomen. For three weeks, Dr. Tepper nursed Louis back to health.
	''We were praying every day for Louis,'' said Dr. Cesta, who has a doctorate in nursing.
	Recently, Dr. Tepper made a well-fish visit to the Cesta home. ''He healed beautifully,'' he said. Louis, who is 8, swam to the top of the pond as if he recognized the doctor and flopped into a wide net without a splash. Dr. Tepper stroked Louis's golden scales and examined a slight scar on the corner of his mouth.
	''He's calm and gentle, very relaxed with people,'' Dr. Tepper noted, giving Louis a clean bill of health.
	But telling when a fish doesn't feel well can be tricky.
	Dr. Tepper's fish checkups are comprehensive.
