	''Can I have it?'' she asked.
	As she twirled past me like some madcap mini-hippie, I grabbed hold of the price tag and took a look.
	''No, it's $68,'' I said.
	As the dervish stopped whirling, the poncho deflated. Clem fingered the fringe wistfully. ''But it's so much fun to wear,'' she said.
	Yes, I know. I had one once. When I was in the sixth grade -- could it really have been 30 years ago? -- I swirled around the playground in an oversized crocheted number. Worn casually with my elephant bellbottoms, a flower-power T-shirt and waist-length hair, the poncho struck a subtle but powerful blow against an older, more conservative generation of jacket wearers. Sleeves? So uptight.
	The poncho is no longer a rebel. As the garment made its spectacular fashion comeback this fall, the symbolism shifted. The same article of clothing that seemed subversive during the Vietnam era has become a safe bet. Now the poncho is popular simply because it's so easy to wear. It goes with everything. One size fits all. It's never too tight.
	The symbolism was lost on Clementine.
	I'm a softie.
