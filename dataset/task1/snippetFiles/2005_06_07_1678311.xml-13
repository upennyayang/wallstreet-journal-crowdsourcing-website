	Consider the page that greets visitors when they finally get past the warning boxes. ''Quod me nutrit, me destruit,'' it declares. What nourishes me destroys me. The site goes on to give tips on how to conceal an eating disorder, including wearing baggy clothes, pretending to eat and hiding the health problems the disorders can bring on. The author of the site, in a ''disclaimer,'' says she is not promoting eating disorders. ''These sites,'' she writes ''do not exist to say: 'I'm anorexic! Aren't I cool? Don't you want to be like me?''' The goal, she says, is to offer support: ''This is a place where people can come to say, 'This is part of who I am. These are people who understand.''' Jenny Wilson, a Stanford medical student and the author of the study, is skeptical of efforts to attach a philosophy to eating disorders. Instead, she sees the Web sites as efforts by people with eating disorders to convince themselves that they have control over their lives. ''I think it's an expression of the disease more than anything,'' Ms. Wilson said. Many of the Web sites show a kind of ambivalence, the researchers said.
