	''More of the calls that I get involve fish that may not have any great monetary value but hold a tremendous emotional value for the owner,'' he said. ''It's really the pet quality that's driving the specialty.''
	The Ã‰lan of Hats
	Doreen Banks, the Nassau County parks commissioner, likes to wear hats.
	''We have a lot of fashionable women in Nassau,'' said Ms. Banks, 48, sporting a straw boater with a trio of peonies. ''There are a number of us who are closet hat freaks. We do look for events to wear them to.''
	To model her favorite wide-brimmed bonnet, and to jump-start a Nassau parks conservancy, Ms. Banks is planning the First Spring Hat Luncheon at the Carltun in Eisenhower Park on May 18.
	''We need to emulate the success of Central Park,'' Ms. Banks said, boasting that Nassau's Eisenhower Park is larger than the city green. ''The best way to do that would be to have a hat luncheon and get powerful, well-connected women to wear wonderful hats.''
	The conservancy, Ms. Banks said, will help restore and maintain Gold Coast-era mansions like the Chelsea Center and Nassau Hall in the Muttontown Preserve and Hempstead Hall at the Sands Point Preserve.
