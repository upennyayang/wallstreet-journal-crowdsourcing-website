	Whether offshore turbines would be audible from land is also an issue. Some people fear a distant whup-whup-whup from the turbine blades. In Atlantic City, Mr. Dovey said there had been no noise complaints from a residential area just across busy Route 30 from the turbines.
	From underneath, the turning blades made a powerful whooshing and paper-tearing sound on a breezy fall afternoon.
	A new opponent on Long Island, Donald Trump, raises an additional issue. He said that the turbines would spoil the view from the recently proposed three-story Trump on the Ocean catering hall that he is financing at Jones Beach.
	''Wind turbines opposite Jones Beach will be an environmental disaster, both in terms of visual and noise,'' Mr. Trump said. ''They are not a pretty thing to look at.''
	Mr. Kessel, the LIPA chairman, was equally critical of Mr. Trump. ''For someone who wants to spoil Jones Beach by building a three-story monster catering hall right on the beach, and that's O.K., but windmills aren't, enough said,'' he said.
	Upstate, Another Kind of Farm
	While Long Island and New Jersey are considering offshore wind farms, the region's wind turbine projects that are furthest along are in upstate New York.
