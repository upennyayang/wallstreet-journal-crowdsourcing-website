	Dennis Puleston, a naturalist, boat designer and yachtsman who, as founding chairman of the Environmental Defense Fund, played a leading role in getting the insecticide DDT banned in the United States and many other countries, died June 8 at his home in Brookhaven, N.Y. He was 95. Mr. Puleston was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Harry S. Truman in 1948 for his work during the World War II in designing the DUKW amphibious landing craft, commonly known as the Duck, which was used in military campaigns like the Normandy landing. After joining the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., in 1948, Mr. Puleston, a keen ornithologist most of his life, began to study a large breeding colony of ospreys -- birds of prey that live off fish and are sometimes called fish hawks -- on the privately owned Gardiners Island, off eastern Long Island. By the early 1960's he had concluded that these ospreys were dying out as a result of the dichloro-diphenyl-trichlorethane, or DDT, being sprayed in the area to keep down mosquitoes; it weakened the shells of the birds' eggs so much that they could not protect the live chicks inside.
