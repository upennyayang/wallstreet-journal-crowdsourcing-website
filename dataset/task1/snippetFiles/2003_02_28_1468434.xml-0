	With its narrow lanes, Roman ruins, timbered pubs named for friars and pilgrims and its namesake tales, Canterbury is a place of lasting antiquity. Today it turned its sturdy ancient face to a lively, if less certain, future.
	A ceremony at Canterbury Cathedral so rich in majesty and pageant that it is known as the ''enthronement'' formally welcomed the Most Rev. Rowan Williams as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, the 104th in a line that stretches back to St. Augustine in 596.
	The cathedral traces its origins to the 11th century and was the site of the murder in 1170 of Archbishop Thomas Ã  Becket, whose shrine became the destination of Geoffrey Chaucer's pilgrimage 200 years later.
	Prince Charles and Prime Minister Tony Blair entered the high-vaulted nave of the gray stone sanctuary, the mother church of Anglican Christianity, along with more than 2,000 church and government figures dressed in traditional robes and wigs and miters.
	Outside, however, a scene of more contemporary portent unfolded. Churchgoers and ministers upset with views expressed by the new archbishop that they found overly progressive paraded before the cathedral gates wearing black armbands.
