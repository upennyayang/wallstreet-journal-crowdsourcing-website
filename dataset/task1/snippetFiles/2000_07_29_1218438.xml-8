	Last October, state officials in Kentucky eliminated the word ''evolution'' but not the scientific theory from the school curriculum, substituting the phrase ''change over time.'' In Oklahoma, officials recently ordered that textbooks carry a disclaimer about the certainty of evolution, a step similar to one already taken by Alabama.
	Evolution's defenders have been active, too, winning last fall when New Mexico banned creationism and endorsed evolution in the science curriculum. New Hampshire, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and other states considered, but defeated, proposals by critics of evolution.
	''It strikes me that evolution is even more of a litmus test than abortion now, courtesy of the Kansas Board of Education,'' said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist. ''It is really the defining characteristic of Kansas politics now.''
	At the time, the board's vote raised an outcry among many Kansans and guaranteed that the issue would be revisited in this year's election. No reliable polls have been released suggesting what might occur on Tuesday, though conservatives are typically better organized and have a better turnout in primaries.
	The issue also figures in a hotly contested Congressional race in the district bordering Kansas City.
