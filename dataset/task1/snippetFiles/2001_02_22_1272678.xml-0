	A New York neurosurgeon who was accused by the state of operating on the wrong side of a patient's brain -- the second such accusation against the doctor in a decade -- is suing the New York State Department of Health and its commissioner for libel, slander and a violation of his civil rights.
	The Department of Health's allegations against the doctor, Ehud Arbit, were brought early last year, when the department got complaints from Dr. Arbit's co-workers that he was botching surgeries and using improper operating techniques and, most alarmingly, that he operated on the wrong side of a patient's brain.
	Dr. Arbit agreed, under tremendous pressure from the department, to forfeit his license while he awaited a hearing on 20 allegations involving 11 patients. Staten Island University Hospital, where he was chief of neurosurgery, was fined $80,000 in relation to the charges. When the fine was imposed, the Health Department held a press conference detailing the allegations, saying that Dr. Arbit's care had endangered patients.
	But last month, a state committee cleared the doctor of almost every charge, and restored his license, which is highly unusual once a doctor has been forced to surrender it.
