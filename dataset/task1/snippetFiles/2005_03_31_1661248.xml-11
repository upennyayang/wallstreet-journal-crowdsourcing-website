	Islanders General Manager Mike Milbury said in a statement that Pellman had been ''completely truthful in presenting his qualifications to the Islanders when we hired him in 1996.''
	But another discrepancy emerged yesterday about Pellman's professional standing. The Islanders' media guide states that he ''is a member of the American College of Sports Medicine.''
	Pellman is no longer a member of the American College of Sports Medicine, and he was not a member when the Islanders hired him. Pellman was a member from 1990 to 1992, said Heather Lloyd, an official of the medical society. Then he stopped paying dues and ceased to be a member, Lloyd wrote in an e-mail message yesterday.
	Chris Botta, a spokesman for the Islanders, was asked yesterday about that discrepancy. He called back a few minutes later to say he had called Pellman and was told that the assertion was inaccurate.
	''It's wrong; he made another mistake,'' Botta said. ''It's something he should have told us about.''
	Botta said Pellman had apologized to him.
	Pellman, who is 51 and practices as an internist in Lake Success on Long Island, did not respond to phone and e-mail messages seeking further comment yesterday.
