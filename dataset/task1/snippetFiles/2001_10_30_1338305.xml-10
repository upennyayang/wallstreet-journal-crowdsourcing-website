	There's a second problem: there's no record. We can know what some ancient creatures looked like because they've left behind a fossil record. There's no record of language until the advent of writing. And while language seems to have existed for about 150,000 years, we've had writing for only about 6,000. So once we get beyond that 6,000-year barrier, we're really just guessing.
	Q. Do we know how the original East African language proliferated into the thousands we have today?
	A. We know it happened because of the process of change. Change is the central reality of human language. The shapes of words, and the structures of languages, are always changing. Once the first language arose, Homo sapiens were turning it upside down and inside out. As soon as there were separate populations of human beings, there were bound to be whole separate languages. And then, once Homo sapiens coated the world, there were thousands of languages.
	Q. Do languages evolve in the same way living organisms do?
	A. Very much. In organisms, a species develops subspecies. Similarly, a language develops dialects.
