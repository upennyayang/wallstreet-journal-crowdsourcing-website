	Ms. Fascione said that for her, the possibility of interbreeding between wolves and coyotes was the biggest concern about the success of wolf restoration in the Northeast. Her organization, which has been instrumental in the Northern Rockies wolf restoration, is completing its own two-part study of restoration in the Northeast.
	An earlier study sponsored by the Wildlife Conservation Society, in 1997, concluded that the Adirondacks were too removed from Canadian wolf packs for any natural recolonization to take place. It also found that the Adirondacks had little more than half the area needed to sustain a wolf population. If wolves were put into the Adirondacks, Dr. Weber said in a recent interview, they would probably expand into more of upstate New York and neighboring New England.
	The 1997 study found that northern New England was a better bet than the Adirondacks for both natural colonization and for providing sufficiently extensive habitat. It also identified two possible corridors near Quebec City along which wolves could disperse from Quebec into Maine. The authors of that study said, however, that further investigation would be required to determine whether wolves were actually likely to move along the corridors.
