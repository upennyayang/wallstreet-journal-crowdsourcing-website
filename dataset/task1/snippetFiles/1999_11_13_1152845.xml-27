	Mr. Kanellos said Norton never answered his letter in the early 1990's when he approached them about a 10-year project that he is coordinating with scholars nationwide to recover, index and publish lost Latino writings in a series of books. (The Norton anthology will be a single volume of about 2,200 pages.)
	Rolando Hinojosa-Smith, a professor of English at the University of Texas at Austin, insists Mr. Stavans deserves the attention that he is getting.
	''If people complain, then they should sit down and produce,'' said Mr. Hinojosa-Smith, who will edit the contemporary Mexican-American section of the upcoming Norton book.
	Still, to some scholars like Ms. Rebolledo, Mr. Stavans remains a bit of a curiosity. ''He doesn't come from within the culture,'' she said. ''He's not Chicano. He's a Mexican. He hasn't been in the movement ever since it started, so he's a little bit of an outsider.''
	That doesn't bother Mr. Stavans, who considers his status as an outsider an advantage. Mr. Stavans said his own upbringing in a Jewish ghetto in Mexico gives him a sense of what it is like to feel marginalized.
