	So why has the price of some prestigious collectibles surged lately? One possibility is that the news media has just played up some extreme, eye-catching cases. Given the high price volatility and wide variety of collectibles, it would be surprising if some prominent items did not rise sharply in value every year.
	Another possibility, however, is that we are in one of those infrequent periods when the price of collectibles is surging. Scott Mitchell, a numismatist at Stack's Coins in New York, said that over the last five years there has been an increase in both the sales volume and price of rare coins, because of publicity about some high-profile sales like the Liberty Head nickel and a desire by investors to move funds from stocks to rare coins.
	Still, the average collector and investor would be wise to recognize that collectibles have historically been a poor investment but a good hobby.
	''The most important thing I have found out,'' said William Gunn of Lawton-Wellington Collectibles Inc. in West Palm Beach, Fla., who has sold sports memorabilia for 27 years, ''is that many people are more interested in the sizzle than the steak when they buy collectibles; they like the story more than the item.''
