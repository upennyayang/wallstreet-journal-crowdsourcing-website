	Q. How big a threat is mad cow disease in American-born and -bred animals?
	A. I don't expect the British strain of mad cow disease to be much of a problem here. The main fear is that our own cattle may carry a different strain of the disease that is distinct from the British strain. There's no evidence one way or another if such a homegrown disease would be a threat to humans. But we've had many potential sources of infection including deer, elk and sheep infected with similar diseases.
	Q. Are we likely to see a case of the human form of mad cow disease in this country?
	A. Yes. But I'm not one of those who believes that the disease has already occurred in the United States and has been covered up. But based on the number of Americans exposed while living in or visiting Europe, it is just a matter of time.
	Q. What is it about mad cow disease that is so frightening?
	A. Dementias are very disturbing to people because they are so embarrassing. You lose bowel and bladder control, go blind and become entirely dependent on others.
