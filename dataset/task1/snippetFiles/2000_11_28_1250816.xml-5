	Lack of Good Studies
	But well-designed, placebo-controlled studies of magnet therapy have been rare. One such well-publicized study at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston suggested that magnet therapy significantly reduced knee pain in 50 patients with post-polio syndrome, although even those who received sham therapy also reported some improvement.
	Another placebo-controlled study by a plastic surgeon in Boca Raton, Fla., indicated that magnet therapy could significantly reduce the pain and swelling that typically follows liposuction. Other studies found magnets helped control foot pain in people with diabetes as well as the pain of dental extractions. Magnet therapy has also helped promote the healing of fractures that fail to unite.
	Yet little attention has been paid to a study of heel pain at the New York College of Podiatric Medicine in which 19 patients who wore magnetic insoles and 15 patients whose insoles looked the same but were not magnetic reported the same 60 percent improvement.
	Likewise, little excitement was generated by a placebo-controlled study of 20 patients with chronic low back pain published in March in The Journal of the American Medical Association, which found no statistically significant difference in pain relief between those using real and sham bipolar magnets.
