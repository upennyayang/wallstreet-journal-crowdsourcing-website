	''As I touched land a curious feeling of hopelessness came over me,'' wrote William Beebe of his arrival in the Gal치pagos in 1923. His curious despair was the kind brought on by hope. In a jungle, Beebe explained, there's no chance of studying everything, but on an island, discovery seems within reason. Everything is visible, circumscribed and isolated. So if there is any spot of earth we can save from ourselves, it would seem to be the Gal치pagos. I was full of hope at every stop we made, and still at every stop I sensed, like Beebe, ''the possibility of an opportunity slipping past forever.''
	At Punta Su치rez on Espa침ola, I met up with a blue-footed booby standing smack in the middle of the footpath. It made no offer to step aside and let me pass. Looking into its birdy eye, I saw . . . nothing at all. No fear, but also no aggression. No anxiety, affection, hope, recognition. Its indifference was profound, as if I were invisible, although I'd been told that if I did step too close it might jab at me with its beak.
	And why did we fall for them?
