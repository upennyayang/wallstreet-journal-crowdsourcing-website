	Joan Ungaro, Mr. Fajardo's teacher at La Guardia, tries to get the students to realize what they have to master and what they can ignore to survive in New York. Most important to her is teaching them to pay attention to spelling and punctuation.
	''It's a cosmetic thing to make them look O.K. and not stand out,'' she explained. ''Not to have their opinions underestimated because they're not put properly. Not to give anyone the out of saying, 'I don't understand what you're saying.' Be simple, clear and say something, but say it in correct English so nobody has that cop-out.''
	For many of these students, there is an intense feeling about the absolute need to learn English so they can get an education. It is the only way they know to advance in a country where they have little money and fewer connections. Zael Peralta, a student at Bronx Community College who was also honored, said English would help him get an education in the classroom and the wider world.
	MOHAMMED TOHIN, another student of Ms. Ungaro's whose essay won an award, wants to study computers so that someday he can give up his job as a hotel bartender.
