	Typical of the outcry was a column in The Independent by Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, an Oxford-educated British Asian writer. ''Mr. Blunkett has insulted all of us,'' she wrote, adding that she was not inclined to follow Mr. Blunkett's advice on becoming more British. ''I feel under no obligation to bring my daughter and son up to drink themselves to death in a pub for a laugh,'' she said.
	Mr. Blunkett protested today that his insistence that people learn to speak English was in their best interest. ''This is not 'linguistic colonialism,' as my critics allege, it is about opportunity and inclusion,'' he said. ''This is not cultural conformity. There is no contradiction between retaining a distinct cultural identity and identifying with Britain.''
	The 90-page report faulted politicians, community leaders, policing, and housing and job discrimination, but it kept returning to the notion of communities choosing to live in separation rather than integration as an ill that was at the root of the unrest and of the inability to forge a common Britishness.
	''Segregation, albeit self-segregation, is an unacceptable basis for a harmonious community and it will lead to more serious problems if it is not tackled,'' the report said.
