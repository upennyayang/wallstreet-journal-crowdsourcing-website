	But just orienting themselves by the position of the sun would not cause the Arctic birds to fly along a great circle. It is the use of such a compass, in combination with the birds' own jet-lagged internal clock, that results in this kind of route.
	Crossing the Arctic, the birds pass through many degrees of longitude in a relatively short distance (far shorter, say, than when crossing the United States). So their internal clocks quickly become out of phase with local time, and this, Dr. Alerstam said, introduces errors in their use of the sun compass that result in an approximation of a great circle route.
	As an example, Dr. Alerstam said, consider a bird traveling east across the Arctic. On the first day at noon, the sun will be due south, and the bird can head due east by orienting itself 90 degrees to the left of the sun's position. The next day, however, when the jet-lagged bird thinks it is noon, it is actually later by local time. So the sun will be somewhere west of due south, and a bird that orients itself in the same way will be heading south-southeast.
