	It is testimony to how open the country has become, compared with recent decades, that a group like Falun Gong could organize on a large scale in the first place, and then persist under such duress. Among other things, for this group as for the struggling democracy movement, electronic mail has proved an even more potent and elusive weapon than the fax machine was for the last generation of dissidents. The authorities can block access to known hostile Web sites, but cannot control or even monitor the e-mail zipping to millions of Chinese, carrying everything from suppressed news to the latest pronouncements of Master Li.
	China's leaders may truly believe they are waging this campaign out of idealism. They surely feel they are saving people from exploitation and ruin, and most important, they think they are preserving the social stability -- meaning preservation of Communist Party rule -- that permitted the great economic and social progress of the post-Mao era. They seem unable to imagine an approach toward possible cults and fringe groups like that in the West: that is, to arrest people who commit demonstrably harmful acts, not those who peacefully express oddball views.
