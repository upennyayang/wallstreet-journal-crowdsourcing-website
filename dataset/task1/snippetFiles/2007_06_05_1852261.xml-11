	But many psychiatrists, pediatricians, family doctors and school officials fear that if validated, sensory processing disorder could become rampant -- a vague diagnosis that could stick insurers and strapped school districts with enormous bills for unproven therapies. The decision is not expected for three or four years, but the controversy is well under way.
	''There's a real resistance to recognizing this, and you can see why, because you're introducing a whole new vocabulary,'' said Dr. Randi Hagerman, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician who is medical director of the MIND Institute at the University of California, Davis. Dr. Hagerman added, ''Many of the behavioral difficulties that are being labeled today as anxiety or A.D.H.D., for instance, may be due to sensory disorders, and that forces you to rethink the treatments,'' as well as diagnoses. Everyone seems to agree that sensory problems are real and disabling in children with diagnoses like autism or Fragile X Syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes social difficulties and learning delays.
	Most youngsters with these diagnoses react strongly to certain sounds, textures or other sensations -- or appear unusually numb to sensory stimulation. They may gag at the mere whiff of common smells, or cry out when touched.
