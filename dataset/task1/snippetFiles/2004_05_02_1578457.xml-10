	''That tells me a lot about the overall health of the pond and the fish,'' Dr. Tepper said, drawing a blood sample to analyze back in his lab.
	''Proper care, especially of the environment they are in, is so critical to their health,'' he said. But by the time the specialist is summoned, the fish are often in very bad shape. Owners tend to blame the neighbors for tossing something evil into the pond, he said.
	''In the six years I have been doing it, I have yet to document that once,'' Dr. Tepper said. ''It's just that ponds crash.''
	Just because the water is clear doesn't mean the aquatic environment is O.K. ''The two deadliest metabolites we deal with, ammonia and nitrite, are clear in water,'' Dr. Tepper said. ''And yet most people are concerned when water is green and murky with algae when in fact that is generally healthy water.''
	When he started practicing in 1978, Dr. Tepper was one of the first animal doctors with a specialty in avian medicine. His training was at the University of Li√®ge in Belgium, where pigeon racing is a local tradition. It made doctoring birds a natural.
