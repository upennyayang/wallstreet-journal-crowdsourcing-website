	The spruce beetle, which is about a quarter-inch long with six legs, is barely visible to most people who roam through evergreen forests in the West and Alaska. Large swaths of forest in Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming have been felled by the bug. But nothing has approached the Alaska kill.
	The beetles take to the air in spring, looking for trees to attack. When they find a vulnerable stand, they will signal to other beetles ''a chemical message,'' Dr. Holsten says. They burrow under the bark, feeding on woody capillary tissue that the tree uses to transport nutrients.
	In Dr. Berg's office, he has a cross-section of a tree that has been under attack by beetles. They build a web of canals as they eat. Eventually, the tree loses its ability to feed itself; it is essentially choked to death, a process that can take several years, Dr. Berg said.
	Spruce trees produce chemicals, called terpenes, that are supposed to drive beetles off. But when so many beetles go after a single tree, the beetles usually win. As it dies, the normally green needles of spruce will turn red, and then, in later years, silver or gray.
