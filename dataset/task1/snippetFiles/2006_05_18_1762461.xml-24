	But John Overstreet, executive director of the Indoor Tanning Association, said the agency is adequately regulating the industry, and Ms. Maloney's bill is unnecessary.
	Many people who regularly visit tanning salons choose to set limits on their exposure, rather than eliminate it.
	Kristyn DeAngelo, 23, who graduated last week from Parsons School of Design, said she visits City Sun five days a week. She said she believes she's protected, as long as she does not get sunburned, and so prefers newer tanning machines that emit lower levels of UVB light. Even so, she said, she covers her face with a towel to avoid tanning because she does not want wrinkles.
	''I know that I won't get burned,'' she said, ''so I think it's a lot safer than being out in the actual sun.''
	But Dr. Spencer cautioned that sunlamps that have lower levels of UVB intensity may give off UVA energy that can be more than 10 times stronger than that of the sun.
	''More UVA energy is more efficient because you can cook yourself faster,'' he said. ''And you can fry body parts like your bottom, eyeballs and genitals that you might not normally fry on the beach.''
