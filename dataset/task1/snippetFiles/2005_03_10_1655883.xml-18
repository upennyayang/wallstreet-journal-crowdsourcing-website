	Mr. Cizik said that Mr. Ball ''dragged'' him to a conference on climate change in 2002 in Oxford, England. Among the speakers were evangelical scientists, including Sir John Houghton, a retired Oxford professor of atmospheric physics who was on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a committee that issued international reports.
	Sir John said in an interview that he had told the group that science and faith together provided proof that climate change should be a Christian concern.
	Mr. Cizik said he had a ''conversion'' on climate change so profound in Oxford that he likened it to an ''altar call,'' when nonbelievers accept Jesus as their savior. Mr. Cizik recently bought a Toyota Prius, a hybrid vehicle.
	Mr. Cizik and Mr. Ball then asked Sir John to speak at a small meeting of evangelical leaders in June in Maryland called by the Evangelical Environmental Network, the National Association of Evangelicals and Christianity Today, the magazine. The leaders read Scripture and said they were moved by three watermen who caught crabs in Chesapeake Bay and said their faith had made them into environmentalists.
	Those leaders produced a ''covenant'' in which 29 committed to ''engage the evangelical community'' on climate change and to produce a ''consensus statement'' within a year.
