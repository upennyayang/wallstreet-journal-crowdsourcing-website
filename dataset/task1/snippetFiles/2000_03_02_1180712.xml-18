	The city has said that non-baseball events would also attract new visitors and generate tax revenue and new businesses on Surf Avenue, where flea markets, the Cyclone roller coaster and a dwindling number of other rides are all that remain of the once-bustling amusement district.
	''This will be an asset the city, and the Mets will seek to generate as much activity as possible,'' Mr. Carey said.
	Minor league ballparks have drawn new fans because of their small, intimate settings and the ability of young fans to talk to players between innings. According to the city's environmental impact statement, the Mets' ball club would draw a total of 210,000 fans to 38 games, an ambitious goal that would establish the club as the most popular of the 40 teams in the short-season Class A league. (Last year, the Staten Island Yankees drew 120,954 playing at the College of Staten Island.)
	The team would pay $350,000 in rent and create the equivalent of 57 full-time jobs.
	The city estimates that each fan would spend about $18.71, including the price of admission, at a game, and less than half that outside the stadium.
