	A Snake With Legs
	Snake evolution, a fairly muddled business to begin with, has gotten more muddled still with the announcement of a 95-million-year-old fossilized snake with legs.
	The 30-inch snake, described in the current issue of the journal Science, is one of three that were found more than two decades ago in a quarry on the West Bank near Jerusalem. Like the other two, the fossil has parts of its small hind legs intact. (Snakes lost their legs as they evolved, and in fact some modern snakes still have vestigial evidence of limbs.)
	The two other fossils, belonging to one species, were described shortly after their discovery in the 1970's. Because of the limbs and characteristics of the skulls, they had been thought to be the oldest known primitive snakes, related to even more primitive marine reptiles known as mosasaurs. This, in turn, had indicated that snakes originated in the oceans.
	But the third fossil, which represents a different species, has shaken things up, and it is not so much the two legs but the skull that is doing the shaking.
	But the analysis also shows that both snakes are not very primitive at all.
