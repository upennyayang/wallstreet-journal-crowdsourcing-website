	In December, when Bonds went back to the batting cage at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco, he said he did so with great reluctance because of thoughts of his father.
	''I really didn't feel like swinging a bat, didn't want any part of it,'' he said. ''And at one point, I broke down crying. I wasn't even sure I wanted to continue playing baseball, but my family and Willie persuaded me to give up those thoughts. They said, 'Barry, this is what you love.' And I do. It's my job, I'm proud of it, and I enjoy being on stage. Regardless of the situation at hand, baseball is not stressful for me. Baseball is a release from stress for me.''
	He has, meanwhile, been able to lean on Mays, who has ''eased the pain.''
	''Willie and I have talked maybe three times a week,'' Bonds said. ''He said, 'Your dad's not here physically for you, but I'm here emotionally for you.' ''
	When asked Monday about Anderson, Bonds said: ''I feel bad for him. I feel sad. We grew up together. We've been friends for a long time.''
