	Talbott: The Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry asked the readers of Dear Abby: If you have suffered from schizophrenia, what was the most important factor in your recovery? We got hundreds of responses. To us, the single most striking factor was the role of their own religion and spirituality. They felt, rightly or wrongly, that a spiritual connection, the ability to believe that they were going to be better through a higher power, was the most important thing. And it was really astounding to the scientists who were looking at this, because we had expected answers like medication or psychotherapy. Bergmann: It doesn't surprise me. The ability to believe is a kind of a human capacity to create within yourself the image of somebody caring for you. And that image then does something for you. So that it's really a kind of a miraculous capacity to imagine a love object and then the love object, which has been imagined, is actually helpful. Bloom: I have certainly had more people talk about their spiritual advisers and their spiritual counselors than I did when I first started practicing. People seem to take for granted that their religious leader is also available to offer some sort of counseling service.
