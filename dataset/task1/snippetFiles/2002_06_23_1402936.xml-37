	James Traylor's family has lived in its house on the Tallapoosa since 1945. One late afternoon in May, he walked down to its banks with his father, George, some neighbors and a black Labrador puppy. ''Something was robbed from me; something was robbed from my kids,'' he said, looking at the low, muddy river that he says is a good two feet lower than it was during the droughts of his childhood 20 years ago.
	The banks have been eaten away at least eight feet in the last 15 years or so. Trees hang over the river because there is no soil to cling to anymore. Fallen timber lies in large piles, carried and mixed up by the daily flooding.
	''We used to wade the tributaries and catch fish when I was a kid,'' Mr. Traylor said. ''You would see deer, muskrats, hawks. Now you go up the creeks, and there's nothing to catch.'' Nothing, he and his friends say, can survive the daily flood and ebb.
	''We just want them to give us a flow, and you can generate your electricity,'' said Curtis B. McGill, a burly man in overalls and baseball cap who has organized his neighbors to negotiate with Alabama Power.
