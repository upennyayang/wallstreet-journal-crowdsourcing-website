	But few forms of thrill are as insidiously destructive as gambling.
	Recently, scientists have peered into the brain while people are playing a game that simulates gambling. Dr. Hans Breiter at Harvard had subjects play a computer game of chance in which they either won or lost money, and monitored their brain activity. He found that the prospect of winning money activates the same dopamine reward pathway in the brain as recreational drugs like cocaine do. No wonder gambling is so compelling. This also helps explain why gamblers, like drug addicts, often seem helpless to resist an impulse that brings intense pleasure but can ruin their lives.
	Curiously, winning the prize is not what seems to make gambling so thrilling and addictive. Dr. David Zald at Vanderbilt University measured dopamine release in a group of subjects who played a computer game in two different conditions. In the first, subjects selected one of four cards and knew they might win a $1 reward, but didn't know when it might occur. In the second, subjects knew ahead that they were guaranteed to win $1 with every fourth card.
	Dr. Zald found a large increase in dopamine activity when winning was unpredictable, but not when the subjects knew what was coming.
