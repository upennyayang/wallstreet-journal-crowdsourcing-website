	A study published last year found that with the right training, rats could overcome some of the deficits caused by alcohol exposure.
	Initially, the alcohol-exposed rats had problems with coordination, particularly in synchronizing the movements of front and rear paws, said the study's lead author, Dr. Anna Klintsova, an assistant professor at the State University of New York at Binghamton. But, after 20 days of training on an obstacle course, the rats learned how to maneuver better.
	To test the improvement, the researchers put the rodents through a ''sort of rat Olympics,'' said co-author Dr. Charles Goodlett, a professor of psychology at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis.
	During the first few runs through the course the rats often fell as they tried to traverse difficult obstacles, like parallel bars. Each time a rat lost balance and fell, its trainer would catch it and and put it back up on the obstacle until the rat figured out how to navigate on its own.
	Ultimately, when the trained, alcohol-exposed rats were tested on an obstacle course that they had never seen, they did as well as trained unexposed rats, Dr. Klintsova said, and they did better than untrained unexposed rats.
