	Scientists suggested that some atmospheric hydrocarbons were being replenished from underground sources of liquid methane. Both before and after Cassini's close encounter, scientists often reminded themselves and others not to make hasty interpretations or be discouraged. They recalled the experience of the earliest spacecraft explorations of Mars. In the first three flybys of Mars, in the 1960's, Dr. Owen pointed out, the Mariner spacecraft ''happened by chance to go over the most boring portion'' of that planet, where the unrelieved cratered landscape invited comparisons with the desolate surface of Earth's Moon. Not until Mariner 9 began orbiting Mars in 1971, photographing its entirety, did scientists see the volcanic peaks and wide canyons, dry channels where water probably once flowed and other traces of a dynamic past. This renewed speculation that life might have existed there. Scientists do not expect to find life on bitterly cold Titan, 290 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. At best, they hope that in the dynamic chemistry of Titan's atmosphere, and possibly its surface, to find insights into how life originated in Earth's early history. Titan is the only moon with a substantial atmosphere; the main constituent of it is nitrogen, as is Earth's.
