	It is the secular-looking site that is evangelistic, Mrs. Schenk said. ''We're just being sensitive to where people are at and inviting them in. We don't have spinning crosses on Women Today.''
	To illustrate how beauty tips might be used to spread the gospel, Mrs. Schenk noted that the most popular article on Women Today Online has been an advice column about frizzy hair. Before reading advertisements for L'Oreal, readers see a link that reads, ''Are you happy with your body?'' If they click on that, they get the life story of a model who battled bulimia but then found success after becoming a born-again Christian. ''You can receive Christ right now by faith through prayer,'' she writes.
	Mrs. Schenk said that about 70 percent of the site's traffic was in the secular areas, but that visitors wanting more could receive prayers, Bible passages or Christian mentoring.
	The Web site www.mops.org, whose initials stand for Mothers of Preschoolers, offers mothers advice and chat rooms for topics like playdates, money, sexuality and medical needs, and organizes more than 3,000 groups that meet in churches around the country and abroad.
