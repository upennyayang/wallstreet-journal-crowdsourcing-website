	In Europe, power providers are having trouble coping with the variable output of wind turbines, according to a study by ABS Energy Research in London. When winds slacken, providers must scramble to draw supplies from conventional plants, the report said. It also suggested that wind power was having only limited impact on overall greenhouse gas emissions.
	For large-scale wind farm developers, subsidies and public policies that assure that every kilowatt of wind power will have a buyer help bridge the cost-per-kilowatt gap. The largest tax offset, the production tax credit, allows developers and investors to recoup capital costs more quickly once turbines are producing. But the credit expires at the end of 2007.
	While the wind industry expects Congress to extend it, slowness could hamstring projects. Congress has let the credit lapse three times in the past, each time causing a virtual cessation of projects until it was reinstated.
	LIPA and FPL want to complete construction of the South Shore turbines in 2009; various federal approvals are needed.
	Project supporters say the tax credit would be passed along to customers, but critics see a bonanza for FPL, the world's largest wind farm owner and operator.
