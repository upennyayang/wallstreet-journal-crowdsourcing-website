	''This is not a high number of new jobs, of course,'' Mr. Forman said. ''But at 3.3 percent unemployment, there is a question as to just how many more jobs the region can add without pulling in significant numbers of workers from other regions, or increasing residential development.''
	Where are the young workers? There is evidence that some are moving farther from New York City.
	Migration from the region to exurban places like Pike and Monroe Counties in northeastern Pennsylvania has increased in the last several years -- especially among young families who make about 30 percent less than the median income for the region, according to Internal Revenue Service data.
	And many are probably living in the city now. The fastest growing segment of commuters from 2000 to 2005 was reverse commuters, the census shows, those living in the city and taking trains or driving to the suburbs for jobs.
	''One of the biggest growth areas on Metro-North is going north from Fordham Road in the Bronx to jobs in White Plains and elsewhere in Westchester,'' said Gerry Bogacz, director of planning for the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council.
