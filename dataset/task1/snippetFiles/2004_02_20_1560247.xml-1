	Since landing Jan. 25, the Opportunity has been exploring the same small crater. One intriguing feature of that crater, in the middle of the vast plain Meridiani Planum, is the small pebbles, many almost perfectly round, scattered over the surface.
	The rover also saw these pebbles, about the size of BB's, embedded in an outcrop of bedrock it cruised past last week, and scientists wanted to see what lies in the dirt, too.
	By holding five of its six wheels steady and then spinning its right front wheel, the Opportunity gouged a trench about a foot and a half long, six inches wide wide and four inches deep on Monday. It then spent three days examining the trench with a camera and two other instruments at the end of a mechanical arm.
	''What we're seeing is spherules again,'' Dr. Albert Yen, a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said at a news conference yesterday. ''They're not only on the top of the surface, but they're underneath as well. Now, what's interesting here is that they appear polished. They appear shiny. Not sure what's going on here.''
