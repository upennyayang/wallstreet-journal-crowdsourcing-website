	Mr. Rubinstein is one of a handful of authors taking a pro-active role in developing audio versions of their books. Thinking this medium could attract new readers, they are trying to create more than a straightforward spoken version of their work. ''I just think that this audio book is a lot more lively than most,'' said Mr. Rubinstein, who added that he has listened to only one or two books in this form. ''If I knew of other audio books that were like this, I would be much more into it,'' he said. The same impulse drove Greg Palast, an investigative journalist and author of ''The Best Democracy Money Can Buy'' and ''Armed Madhouse: Who's Afraid of Osama Wolf?, China Floats, Bush Sinks, the Scheme to Steal '08, No Child's Behind Left, and Other Dispatches From the Front Lines of the Class War'' (E. P. Dutton), which in hardcover will be No. 11 on the New York Times nonfiction hardcover best-seller list on Sunday. For the audio version Mr. Palast has assembled a cast including the comedian and actress Janeane Garofalo, the television veteran Ed Asner and the punk rocker Jello Biafra, whose voices are heard in between Mr. Palast's narration.
