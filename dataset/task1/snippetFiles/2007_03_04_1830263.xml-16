	Atran saw such questions as a puzzle when applied to religion. So many aspects of religious belief involve misattribution and misunderstanding of the real world. Wouldn't this be a liability in the survival-of-the-fittest competition? To Atran, religious belief requires taking ''what is materially false to be true'' and ''what is materially true to be false.'' One example of this is the belief that even after someone dies and the body demonstrably disintegrates, that person will still exist, will still be able to laugh and cry, to feel pain and joy. This confusion ''does not appear to be a reasonable evolutionary strategy,'' Atran wrote in ''In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion'' in 2002. ''Imagine another animal that took injury for health or big for small or fast for slow or dead for alive. It's unlikely that such a species could survive.'' He began to look for a sideways explanation: if religious belief was not adaptive, perhaps it was associated with something else that was.
	Atran intended to study mathematics when he entered Columbia as a precocious 17-year-old. But he was distracted by the radical politics of the late '60s.
