	So now she is taking a five-week course in which she learns basic computer skills that include using a mouse, Microsoft Word and the Internet. Every weekday she and 15 other Chinese garment workers take three hours of computer classes and two hours of English classes -- the first step, she hopes, toward getting a steady office job.
	''This is a lot of fun,'' Ms. Zou said with the help of a translator. ''I know computers are better than a garment job.''
	Ms. Zou is happy that the course is free. It is conducted by the Consortium for Worker Education, a union-affiliated organization that trains 110,000 people a year, making it the city's largest job-training group.
	Even though Ms. Zou is not a union member, she can take the course because the consortium, having shown its success in training unionized workers ranging from nurse's aides to carpenters, has been given government and foundation contracts to train thousands of nonunion members as well.
	A recent study by the Center for an Urban Future, a public-policy research group, praised the consortium and other labor-affiliated training efforts, saying they generally do a better job than programs run by nonprofit organizations or the government.
