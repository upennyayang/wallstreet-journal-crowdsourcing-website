	Not all supersize projects are suitable for the distributed approach, and large computing chores like weather simulation do not work well because quick calculations are needed. One project in which a cluster proved effective was the RC5-56 Secret Key Challenge, in which thousands of volunteers donated computer time to crack a 56-bit encryption code. The project was one of a number run by Distributed.net, a nonprofit organization that has signed up about 60,000 participants to participate in a variety of code-cracking contests.
	All told, SETI@Home's users are currently averaging about 12 teraflops, or 12 trillion calculations per second, over the course of a day, said Dr. Dan Werthimer, an astronomer at Berkeley and the chief scientist for the project. ''It's the largest computation that's ever been done -- on this planet, anyway,'' Dr. Werthimer said.
	Dr. Werthimer calculated that home users had donated 283,000 years of computing time to the project so far. ''They're donating time, about 1,000 years every day,'' he said.
	Supercomputers are usually used for large computing problems, like nuclear weapons research and weather forecasting, that require a staggering number of calculations, but they are ''super'' in both processing power and price tag.
