	They then turned their efforts toward overcoming the synchronization problem. Part of the inspiration for the solution came from work that Dr. Korniss, now an assistant professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, was doing with biologists. He was developing a massive parallel computer model that could simulate the effects of introducing new species into a region. At one level, he said, computers in a parallel network have a relationship to each other that is a bit like that between many animals. ''They do not want to work with each other,'' Dr. Korniss said. ''But they do not have anything against each other.''
	Together with Hasan Guclu, a graduate student at Rensselaer, Mark A. Novotny, a physics professor at Mississippi State University, and Per Rikvold, a physics professor at Florida State University, Dr. Korniss and Dr. Toroczkai began developing a mathematical model that exploited the computers' indifferent relationships using the small-world theory behind six degrees of separation.
	Their model, which was published in the Jan. 31 issue of the journal Science, shows that synchronization can be achieved by having processors occasionally and randomly check what some other processor in the system is doing.
	The randomness of the checks is a key.
