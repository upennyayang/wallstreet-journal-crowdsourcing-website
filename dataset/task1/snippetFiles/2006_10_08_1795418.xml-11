	Yet after we review the data, the question lingers: Did stolen signs afford an advantage that created even a single undeserved win, which would have been enough to deny Brooklyn the flag? And might that win have been the ultimate one, in Game 3 of the playoff?
	This appeared to be the question animating Prager when he wrote his Wall Street Journal article, and it provoked umbrage from veteran baseball writers. Five years later, after indefatigable research not always appreciated by the fatigable reader, the story appears to have twisted in Prager's hands. In a concluding author's note he writes, ''And I say that as regards the stealing of signs, my book is not about the debatable effects of a telescope on play but about the undeniable effects of a secret on two men.''
	Is the book more than the original article pumped up on steroids? Yes. ''The Echoing Green'' is a revelation and a page turner, a group character study unequaled in baseball writing since Roger Kahn's ''Boys of Summer'' some three decades ago. It is an ambitious book stylistically, with beautiful passages far outnumbering the clunkers. Still, there are clunkers and annoyances.
