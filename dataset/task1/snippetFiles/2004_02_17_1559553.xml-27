	''It's weird negative pressure,'' said Dr. Lawrence M. Krauss, an astrophysicist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
	While the density of the energy in Einstein's cosmological constant stays the same as the universe expands, the density of phantom energy would go up and up, eventually becoming infinite. Such would be the case if the parameter w turned out to be less than minus 1, say physicists, who admit they are stunned by the possibility and until recently simply refused to consider it.
	''It crosses a boundary of good taste,'' Dr. Caldwell said, calling phantom energy ''bad news stuff.'' Phantom energy violates physicists' intuitions about how the universe should behave. A chunk of it could be used to prop open wormholes in space and time -- and thus create time machines, for example.
	''It could lead to such bizarre effects as negative kinetic energy,'' Dr. Krauss said. As a result, objects like atoms would be able to lose energy by speeding up.
	Nevertheless, a recent analysis by Dr. Caldwell and his Dartmouth colleague Dr. Michael Doran of the supernova measurements to date, combined with other cosmological data, suggest that w could lie anywhere from minus 0.8 to minus 1.25, leaving open the possibility of phantom energy.
