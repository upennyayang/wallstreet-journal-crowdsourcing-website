	But Dr. Steven R. Gill, a microbiologist at the Institute for Genomic Research, countered that if a creature's genetic blueprint was known, ''we can go back and reconstruct its metabolism.''
	Besides providing clues about the roles organisms play, such information may pinpoint nutrients they need, allowing previously unculturable organisms to be grown in the laboratory. And once all the genes in an organism or community are known, it will be possible to make gene chips to study which genes are turned on or off as environmental conditions change.
	Some scientists think ecosystem genome sequencing may eventually be used to monitor the health of environments or to predict environmental impacts. That could apply not only to the external environment but also to the ones inside people.
	Dr. David A. Relman, an associate professor of medicine and microbiology at Stanford who is collaborating on the project to read the DNA of the bacteria in the human digestive tract, said changes in those bacterial communities contributed to diseases like colitis.
	It may be possible to find patterns in the bacterial population that will predict when someone is about to get sick. The human gut metagenome project ''will be the first step in identifying these patterns,'' Dr. Relman said.
