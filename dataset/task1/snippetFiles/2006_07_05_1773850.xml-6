	The same impulse drove Greg Palast, an investigative journalist and author of ''The Best Democracy Money Can Buy'' and ''Armed Madhouse: Who's Afraid of Osama Wolf?, China Floats, Bush Sinks, the Scheme to Steal '08, No Child's Behind Left, and Other Dispatches From the Front Lines of the Class War'' (E. P. Dutton), which in hardcover will be No. 11 on the New York Times nonfiction hardcover best-seller list on Sunday. For the audio version Mr. Palast has assembled a cast including the comedian and actress Janeane Garofalo, the television veteran Ed Asner and the punk rocker Jello Biafra, whose voices are heard in between Mr. Palast's narration.
	Sarah Vowell, a contributing editor on public radio's ''This American Life'' program, recruited a group that included the novelist Stephen King, the actress Catherine Keener and the host of ''The Daily Show'', Jon Stewart, to read for the audio book of ''Assassination Vacation,'' produced by Simon &amp; Schuster Audio last year.
	''I wanted to think about making it a little more show biz,'' Ms. Vowell said. ''I wouldn't necessarily use the word dulcet to describe my voice all the time, so I wanted other readers to break it up.''
