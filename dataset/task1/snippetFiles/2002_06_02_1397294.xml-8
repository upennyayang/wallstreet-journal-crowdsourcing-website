	The California attorney general's office is investigating whether natural gas prices were manipulated during the state's energy crisis, which stretched from the summer of 2000 into 2001. But it declined to say if Williams, which controls significant natural gas pipeline capacity into Southern California, is under investigation.
	Williams denies that it did anything illegal in California or anywhere else. ''There has been any number of investigations, and Williams has fully cooperated,'' said William Hobbs, president of the energy marketing and trading unit at Williams. ''We have provided piles and piles of documents, and no one has come back and said that Williams has done anything wrong.''
	The company did refund $8 million to California last year as part of a settlement agreement with federal regulators who were investigating whether power was withheld in the state to drive up the price of electricity. Williams did not acknowledge any wrongdoing.
	Like the country's other major power traders, Williams has struggled to avoid the taint of malfeasance ever since Enron's problems began to become known late last year.
	WILLIAMS has been among the most adamant in asserting that it is nothing like Enron and that it has been unfairly tarred with the same brush.
