	The focus of the new federal study was conflicting records of atmospheric temperature trends.
	For more than a decade, scientists using different methods had come up with differing rates of warming at Earth's surface and in the midsection of the atmosphere, called the troposphere. These disparities had been cited by a small group of scientists, and by the administration and its allies, to question a growing consensus among climatologists that warming from heat-trapping gases could dangerously heat Earth.
	The new study found that ''there is no longer a discrepancy in the rate of global average temperature increase for the surface compared with higher levels in the atmosphere,'' in the words of a news release issued by the Commerce Department and approved by the White House. The report was published yesterday online at climatescience.gov.
	The report's authors all agreed that their review of the data showed that the atmosphere was, in fact, warming in ways that generally meshed with computer simulations. The study said that the only factor that could explain the measured warming of Earth's average temperature over the last 50 years was the buildup heat-trapping gases, which are mainly emitted by burning coal and oil.
