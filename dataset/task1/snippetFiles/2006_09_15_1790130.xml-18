	Luhnow said Shandler's report on Mulder did not affect the Cardinals' decision making. ''It wasn't something that was of concern or something that ruffled feathers,'' he said. ''It was him doing his job and being a journalist.'' Mulder went 16-8 in his first season with the Cardinals, but his strikeout rate declined greatly. His shoulder bothered him throughout this season, and he was 6-7 with 7.14 earned run average. Shandler said the criticism of his report on Mulder led him to decide to step down. ''That's where things kind of stepped over the line and I said I've got two different worlds I'm living in and I'm not quite sure this is going to work,'' Shandler said. After his short tenure with the Cardinals, Shandler refocused on BaseballHQ and ''Baseball Forecaster.'' ''Working for a major league club was not a glory thing for me,'' he said. ''It was just another feather in my hat, just like being written about in 'Fantasyland.' When I decided to leave, it wasn't the type of huge decision that a lot of people thought it might have been.''
