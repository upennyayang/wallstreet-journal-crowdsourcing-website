	JOHAN REINHARD called a friend in Texas recently to chat from near the top of the world. A high-altitude anthropologist whose explorations in the Andes and Himalayas often appear in National Geographic, Dr. Reinhard was standing at the summit of a 20,000-foot mountain in Peru, using a new kind of telephone that beams conversation from virtually anywhere on earth to a constellation of low-orbit satellites and back down to terrestrial wired and wireless phone networks.
	Had he wished to (and had he the stamina to carry all the gear up the mountain), he could have snapped a picture of himself with a digital camera, attached it to a lightweight portable computer, and sent the image halfway across the planet as electronic mail via satellite phone over the Internet -- an instant, electronic postcard from the new era of travel.
	Technology is transforming travel not just for explorers in remote corners of the world, but also for families packing the minivan for a drive to Grandma's house, and for the travel industry itself.
	Technically savvy consumers have been able to research travel destinations and make airline reservations from home for more than a decade using personal computers and early on-line information services such as Compuserve.
