	Then, I got my hands on a ''chirp,'' which is the sound representation of the gravity wave produced when two black holes collide. I digitized that sound and created a song called ''Black Hole Song,'' to the tune of the Beatles' ''Blackbird,'' which is about LIGO, the gravity wave detector Kip is building: Black holes spinning in the dead of night Spiraling around, out of sight, Until you collide. We are waiting for your waves to arrive. Q. I understand that you take your show into the high schools to encourage students to take their math and science studies more seriously? A. Yes, I have ''Science Raves,'' which are pep rallies for science and math. I present multimedia MTV-style shows and take a streetwise approach so that they don't turn off. For instance, I sing a rap song called, ''Player,'' which goes: ''If you want to be a player in this high-tech world, you've got to get down and wrap your mind around science.'' The idea is, if you don't understand something, you give your power away and that's a dangerous thing in these high-tech times.
