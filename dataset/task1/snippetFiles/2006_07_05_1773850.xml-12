	Indeed, those celebrities who perform on audio books see it mainly as a way to express their support for a friend or favorite author. Jello Biafra, the former lead singer of the Dead Kennedys, said he agreed to read the part of Osama bin Laden on Mr. Palast's ''Armed Madhouse'' because he wanted to help Mr. Palast get out his muckraking message about the Bush administration.
	Jello Biafra spent less than an hour in the studio. ''I gave them different flavors of bin Laden,'' he said. ''I cut the lines of a wicked cartoon villain, Snidely Whiplash-style, with a lot of ya ha ha ha has. Then I did it straight in my own voice, and then I did it in something akin to bin Laden's voice from what I've heard of his videos. I believe they chose the one closest to bin Laden's voice.''
	Mr. Shteyngart, author of ''The Russian Debutante's Handbook'' and ''Absurdistan,'' had given Mr. Rubinstein a blurb for the hardcover edition of ''Ballad of the Whiskey Robber,'' and so was game to play a few characters on the audio book.
