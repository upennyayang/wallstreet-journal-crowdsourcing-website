	Dictionary of the Future, by Faith Popcorn and Adam Hanft (Hyperion, $22.95), is the cheery ''speak preview'' product of a couple of marketing futurists. They create words like geriborg, a robot built to make old age easier for ''baby boomers growing old in the digital age'' with never-hungry electronic dogs wagging their feather tails, ever ready to take out the garbage. Sinister hacktivists flood computer servers with denial-of-service attacks, while old-fashioned spamming is blocked by address munging, ''modifying one's e-mail address in such a way that computers can't read it but humans can.'' My favorite description of a growing annoyance is secondhand speech, ''the cellphone equivalent of secondhand smoke.'' The Word Detective (Plume paperback, $11) is breezy etymology by Evan Morris. Kangaroo court, for example, is not rooted in Australia, home of that marsupial with strong hindquarters, but in Texas in the mid-19th century. He defines it as ''any court whose verdict is arranged in advance or otherwise clearly unfair'' and ''draws a sardonic analogy between the hopping gait of a kangaroo and the irrational and unpredictable conduct of the original frontier tribunals,'' complete with their ''leaps of logic.''
