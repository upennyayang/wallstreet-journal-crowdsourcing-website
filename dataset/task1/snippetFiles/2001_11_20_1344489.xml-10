	After childbirth, he said, 20 to 30 percent of hairs go into telogen, and suddenly, about three months after giving birth, women start losing large amounts of hair. But the phenomenon is only temporary and usually reverses itself within six months. Once the ''excess'' hair is lost, there is a return to the normal 10 percent of hairs in telogen and a slowdown of hair loss.
	Chemotherapy for cancer, on the other hand, interferes with anagen, the growing phase, because the drugs are designed to disable fast-growing cells. Once these drugs are stopped, normal hair growth resumes.
	Other factors that can tip the balance to excessive hair loss are thyroid hormone deficiency, crash diets, major surgery, a severe infection or high fever, a flare-up of an autoimmune disease like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, and certain drugs, including beta blockers and oral contraceptives with high androgenic indexes. Severe stress, as may accompany the breakup of a marriage or the sudden loss of a loved one, can also precipitate hair loss, although Dr. Whiting said the causative mechanism was not known.
	One thing that does not cause hair loss in women is failure to take good care of their hair.
