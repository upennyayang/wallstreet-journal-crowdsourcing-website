	But the researchers also found that differently colored barbs differed slightly in how these matrices were arranged. Depending on how closely the rods were spaced and how many layers of rods were stacked up, the barbule could appear anything from yellow to green to blue to brown.
	Scientists tested the importance of these structures in creating color by dipping the feathers in glycerin, altering the structure by filling in its minuscule air holes with the clear liquid.
	What they found was that the glycerin slightly altered the colors of the feather, something that would not have happened if pigments were responsible for the feather's coloration.
	In fact, most often colors in nature are caused by pigments, like the pigments in paint. When light shines on a pigment, the pigment produces the color red, for example, by absorbing all the light except for the red light. That light is reflected back to the eye, which then sees a red color.
	In contrast, in peacock feathers, it is the precise structural array of melanin rods in keratin that creates different colors, with one array reflecting back yellow light, for example, and a slightly different arrangement reflecting back blue light.
