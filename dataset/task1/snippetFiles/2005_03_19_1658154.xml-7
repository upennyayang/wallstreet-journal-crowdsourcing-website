	La Russa returned to the same refrain twice more in what was not a lengthy interview with reporters. ''A couple of key comments were not made,'' he said. ''He repeated that one thing over and over again like he had been coached that that was a smart thing to say.''
	It was suggested that perhaps McGwire had not repeated his earlier statement because he was speaking under oath.
	''In my opinion,'' La Russa said, ''being under oath wouldn't have changed what he would have said. I don't take that conclusion; I believed him when he made the statement.''
	But did La Russa think the possibility of perjuring himself was the reason McGwire had not repeated his earlier denials? ''No, that's not what I think,'' La Russa said. ''I just think he was overcoached. That's what I think.''
	La Russa is a lawyer, but he has not represented clients who have been subpoenaed to testify before Congress. His support of McGwire is not based on any legal grounds. He was familiar with McGwire's workout routine in Oakland and St. Louis and the nutrition program he followed religiously.
