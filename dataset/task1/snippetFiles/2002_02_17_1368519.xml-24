	One morning at an East Side Starbucks, (about as close as one can get to the legacy of Melville in New York these days), after changing tables to avoid being overheard, Mr. Governali looked left and right, hunched his shoulders and said with hushed urgency: ''The British sent three expeditions here to locate the ship. They had sunken ships all over the world. Why come here for that one ship?''
	Craig Leckner, a casting agent and friend of Mr. Governali's who has helped him with his research, says he began as a debunker. Trolling through the paper trail, however, he says he has seen enough to make him think there might be something to the rumors.
	''There's not a treasure hunter in the world who doesn't know about the Hussar,'' he said. ''What's great about Joe is that here's this average guy who has a chance to change history.''
	While Mr. Governali, who is divorced and has no children, has long been a diver, he is hardly the weather-beaten, salt-encrusted Jacques Cousteau character one might expect of a treasure hunter. He looks more suited to play, and indeed is often cast in, one of Hollywood's most enduring roles: a Mafioso.
