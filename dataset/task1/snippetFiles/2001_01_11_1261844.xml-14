	On the second model, the researchers focused the laser beam so that it only hit the edge of the microdisk. This time, the sensors, modified versions of devices normally used in fiber optic networks, showed that the device was producing single photons. ''I don't like to paraphrase God,'' Dr. Petroff said. ''But it was as if he said, 'Let there be a photon' and there was a photon.'' But problems remain. Because the microdisk is circular, the photons fly off in any direction, making their detection unnecessarily difficult. The researchers hope that a new model, with an elliptical disk, will offer more directed output. The current device also requires extreme cooling to operate, making the unit the size of a tabletop, despite the tiny proportions of the actual photon emitter. Dr. Petroff said that over time, a much more compact model that works at room temperature would be possible. Quantum computers are based on a different code than the binary system of zeroes and ones that are the basis of conventional computers. In the atomic and subatomic world of quantum theory, normal rules do not apply. Among other things, that allows quantum computers to be based on units that can represent several states at the same time.
