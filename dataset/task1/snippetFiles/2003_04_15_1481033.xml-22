	Dr. Richard Wilson, director of the Washington University center, said the hardest chromosome had been the Y chromosome, which is small but has many highly repetitive sequences that are hard to tell apart. In Chromosome 7, the individual being sequenced possesses a gene not found in other people, Dr. Wilson said.
	The sequence of each of the 24 human chromosomes was put together by a chromosome coordinator. Each coordinator's work was checked against independent data developed by Dr. David Jaffe and Dr. Eric Lander at the Whitehead Institute.
	The Human Genome Project was originally projected to cost a total of $3 billion. Money spent by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy since the beginning of the project has come to $2.7 billion, but that does not include spending by the Sanger Institute and other foreign collaborators.
	The total spending of the Human Genome Project includes pilot projects like sequencing the roundworm and fruit fly genomes. No exact figure was given at today's press conference for sequencing the human genome specifically.
	Though the Human Genome Project has been declared completed, the genome sequencing centers will not go out of business.
