	Gallo initially denied that his virus and the French virus were the same. When that position became untenable, he suggested that the French laboratory had misappropriated his virus, not vice versa; after all, he had supplied the French with samples of his virus in the summer of 1984. But Montagnier's group had described LAV in print a year before they received samples of HTLV-3B from Gallo. Also, Popovic, who had supposedly isolated HTLV-3B, was vague about its origins. Popovic eventually said he had extracted the virus from a ''pool'' of blood from many patients, a procedure frowned upon by other virologists.
	Meanwhile, both the Pasteur Institute and Gallo's team applied for patents for a test that could detect the virus. After the Patent and Trademark Office awarded the patent to Gallo's group in May 1985, the Pasteur Institute sued, contending it had discovered the virus used in the Gallo test. When the French produced supporting records, Gallo retorted that their ''meticulous and apparently premeditated documentation'' showed they cared more about ''patents and notoriety'' than about good science. He also kept churning out revised versions of his own discovery of the AIDS virus, contending in one paper that he had isolated it as early as 1982.
