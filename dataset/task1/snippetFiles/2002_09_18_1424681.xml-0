	Six months after his state became a laughingstock for the 36-day stalemate in the 2000 presidential election, Gov. Jeb Bush declared that Florida would become a ''model for the rest of the nation'' in reforming elections. But now that Florida has spent $32 million to overhaul its voting system, some experts say the state may serve as a model of what not to do.
	In their view, Florida officials, stung by the electoral crisis and the ridicule it provoked, rushed headlong into overhauling the state's entire system at once and in many cases did not allow enough time to hold mock elections to educate voters and poll workers alike and work out the inevitable kinks.
	Beyond that, in the statewide primary election last week, chaos reigned in the most-populous counties, Broward and Miami-Dade, with last-minute changes in the operation of the new computerized touch-screen machines and insufficient training of poll workers.
	''It's possible to do too much too quickly, and buying new machines does not reform make,'' said Doug Chapin of Electionline.org, a clearinghouse for election reform information set up by the Pew Charitable Trust.
