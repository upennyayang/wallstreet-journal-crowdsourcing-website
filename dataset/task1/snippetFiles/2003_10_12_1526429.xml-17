	Johnson's famous preface to his dictionary would inform the thought of Murray. Johnson spoke of ''the dreams of a poet doomed at last to wake a lexicographer.'' Of the endlessness of any such work: ''I saw that one enquiry only gave occasion to another, that book referred to book, that to search was not always to find, and to find was not always to be informed.'' And of the necessarily finite vision of what could be done: ''To pursue perfection, was, like the first inhabitants of Arcadia, to chase the sun, which, when they had reached the hill where he seemed to rest, was still beheld at the same distance from them.''
	Johnson had come to terms with the burden of the work by the expedient of funneling it on to his own desk. ''I . . . contracted my design, determined to confide in myself, and no longer to solicit auxiliaries, which produced more incumbrance than assistance; by this I obtained at least one advantage, that I set limits to my work, which would in time be ended, though not completed.'' Murray did not try to impose such restrictions upon himself, indeed could not conceivably have done so given the scope of the undertaking.
