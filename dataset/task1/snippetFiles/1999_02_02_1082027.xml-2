	But scientists have never had pure samples to study. Soon, though, they will, if everything goes as planned.
	On Saturday, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is to launch a probe meant to capture interplanetary and interstellar dust in some of its rawest and purest forms, including many thousands of grains from a comet. After a seven-year trek, the craft is to return the samples to Earth, the first ever from beyond the Moon.
	Appropriately enough, the mission is dubbed Stardust.
	''We want to find out what this stuff is like,'' said Dr. Donald C. Brownlee of the University of Washington, the chief scientist of the mission. ''It's the building block of planets and human bodies.''
	Dr. Alastair G. W. Cameron, an astrophysicist at Harvard University, said scooping up star dust would greatly expand a field that has recently undergone ''a revolution'' in understanding not only how stars live and die but thrive in surprising diversity.
	The urge to investigate is driven by more than curiosity. Earth sits in a cosmic shooting gallery, surrounded by speeding blocks of ice and rock. The last time a really big one hit, 65 million years ago, the tumult helped do in the dinosaurs, among other creatures.
