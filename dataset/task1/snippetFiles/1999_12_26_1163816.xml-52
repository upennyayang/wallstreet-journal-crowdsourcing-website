	The Brooklyn Tabernacle sounds a similar theme in its plan for a $37 million ''campus'' designed by Kapell &amp; Kostow and centered on the 81-year-old Metropolitan Theater, one block from Macy's on the Fulton Street mall. The facade of the theater and two adjoining buildings will be reclad in brick and limestone and a bell tower will be added at the corner of Livingston and Gallatin Streets, rising 115 feet.
	''Just as the Lord is our lighthouse,'' the Tabernacle declares on its Web site, ''we pray that this new campus will act as a lighthouse to the lost and needy.''
	Loew's Metropolitan was built in 1918 in the shell of an old dry-goods store. It was designed by Thomas W. Lamb, arguably the foremost theatrical architect of his day, and is lush with ornamentation, including medallions and cameo-like reliefs with crouching sphinxes and gamboling sprites.
	With the removal of interior walls that had divided the theater into a quad, the astonishing enormity of the auditorium is once again apparent. Its deep balcony seems to sweep halfway across downtown.
	And the tabernacle can use the space.
