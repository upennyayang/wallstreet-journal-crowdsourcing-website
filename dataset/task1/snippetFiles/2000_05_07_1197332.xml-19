	Jonathan Lear: There's a shift in popular culture in its relation to psychotherapy. Last decade, three popular shows on television were ''Seinfeld,'' ''Friends'' and ''Ally McBeal.'' They all shared this underlying assumption that human intimacy of the standard one-heterosexual-married-couple isn't possible. And that what there really is in the world is a conversation among one's friends or business partners or flatmates about why this more traditional idea of intimacy is just not going to work. And so it's a basically ironic stance. And then there's a shift, I think, last year, to ''The Sopranos.'' You know, this guy is a gangster, and he has his women on the side and whatever, but he's trying to make his marriage work. He's trying to deal with the responsibilities of the office. And trying to come to terms with, in terms of what Ethel was saying, very primitive fantasies that are under the surface and got him where he is. There's a kind of earnestness. It seems to me like the nature of the refuge shifted, like irony as a defense against the kinds of anxieties that have been discussed is collapsing.
