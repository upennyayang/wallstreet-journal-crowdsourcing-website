	Among this year's new singers is Angela Gilbert, who will sing Inez -- Ms. Hendricks's role, with the cadenzas Ms. Queler wrote for Ms. Hendricks -- in ''La Favorita'' on Wednesday.
	Participants in the Young Artists Program have no guarantee of this kind of spotlight. If Ms. Queler thinks a singer might cancel, she will often engage a second, ''secret'' cover to go in for the Carnegie Hall performance. Nor is hers an entry-level program; singers are more likely to be drawn from the rosters of artists' managers -- especially that of Ms. Queler's own manager, Robert Lombardo -- than from the hundreds of résumés the Opera Orchestra receives for each available slot.
	Originally, the young artists usually had a performance of their own at college campuses in Brooklyn and the Bronx, but it was hard to generate an audience, and these performances were finally dropped. These days, about a third of the young-artists casts get a performance in New Jersey, thanks to a developing association with the Ars Musica Chorale, a New Jersey chorus. And last season Ms. Queler and the second cast of ''Otello'' performed the opera twice with the Orquestra Sinfónica del Estado de México in Toluca, Mexico.
