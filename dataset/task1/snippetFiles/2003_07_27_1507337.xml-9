	Nothing is too large or too small to merit Sims's attention, and nothing human disgusts him. He quotes from a medical text by Frederic Wood Jones treating of, among other podal matters, the hallux -- ''the technical term for the innermost digit on the hind limb of pentadactyl creatures'' -- in which the English anatomist bemoans the fact that ''the big toe lacks its champion.'' Not anymore. Sims describes ''Adam's Navel'' as ''something of a hybrid,'' which is something of an understatement. (Entering into the Simsian spirit, I cannot forbear to note the source of the word ''hybrid'' according to Chambers Dictionary: ''L. hybrida, offspring of a tame sow and wild boar.'') The book had its source in an accident that damaged one of Sims's cervical disks, leading to a diskectomy that forced him to lie immobile on his back for two weeks. In an understandably concentrated state of mind during this period of forced inactivity, he brooded much on the human body. He decided from the start to concentrate on the outward form of the body, summoning to his support Oscar Wilde at his pithiest: ''The great mystery of the world is not the invisible, but the visible.''
