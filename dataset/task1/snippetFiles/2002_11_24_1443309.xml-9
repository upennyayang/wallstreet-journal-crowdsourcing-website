	They are smaller to begin with and are located in a region that is more sensitive to climate change -- and the climate has changed.
	In Bolivia the temperature rose by 1 degree centigrade in the last century, mirroring the rise in some other parts of the world, said Robert Gallaire, a hydrologist with the Institute of Research for Development, a French scientific organization studying glaciers here.
	At the same time, less rain and snow are falling in the area around La Paz, with the average annual rainfall dropping to 17.88 inches in the 1990's from 22.4 inches in the 1980's, according to measurements at Milluni Lagoon at the foot of Huayna Potosi.
	Scientists attribute the unseasonably dry years to El Ni√±o, a weather phenomenon generated by warm Pacific currents off the South American coast that has struck numerous times in the last two decades.
	The changes are already being noticed by the people who live in the mountains, raising anxieties. ''It is worrisome,'' said Angel Quisverte, 55, a potato farmer who lives on the north side of Zongo, ''because if there are no snows, then there is no life.''
