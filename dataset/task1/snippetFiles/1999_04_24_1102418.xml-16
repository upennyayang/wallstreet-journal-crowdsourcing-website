	''He'd have been against the wall in the corner,'' said Tim McCarver, the baseball announcer who switched from the Mets to the Yankees this season. ''In the most obscure part of the room, like he always was.''
	The day's events were arranged by Dr. Rock G. Positano, a foot and ankle specialist at the Hospital for Special Surgery, who treated DiMaggio's aching feet, along with those of Mr. Zuckerman, Dr. Kissinger and Mayor Giuliani. Dr. Positano was assigned the task of staging the memorial by Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's lawyer and Florida neighbor, who figured that arranging a Roman Catholic service was not up his alley.
	It was Dr. Positano who sent invitations, not only to the Yankee front office and DiMaggio's former teammates, but to the city's media and literary elite. They included the writers Ken Auletta, Richard Reeves and Nicholas Pileggi and the agent Esther Newberg, who passed the time before the service tartly speculating about whether Dr. Kissinger was discussing the Balkans with the Yankee contingent.
	Dr. Kissinger was not terribly informative on the subject when asked at Le Cirque. ''We were talking about Joe DiMaggio,'' he said.
