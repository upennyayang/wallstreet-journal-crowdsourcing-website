	She said she worried that ''students from out of state won't want to come here and study because they feel the standards won't be up to snuff.''
	Mrs. Gamble's opponent, Linda Holloway, a conservative who headed the school board when the evolution decision was made, has raised $90,000, an extraordinary sum in such races. Mrs. Gamble has raised $36,000.
	Mrs. Holloway, a former teacher, said she supported the new science standards because she believed evolution had been made to seem too important to science.
	''I believe we should teach evolution in the schools,'' she said, ''but I also believe that if local districts want to teach that or other theories, that should be up to them. Gosh, there could have been a lot bigger things that we could have done. This was pretty mild.''
	In Wichita, the conservative incumbent, Mary Douglass Brown, said the new standards ''put a little crack in the foundation'' of evolution scientists, ''their money, their books, their schools.''
	''There's a lot of money in evolution,'' Mrs. Brown, a former teacher, said. ''To me, it's pseudoscience.''
	Mrs. Brown said the board left in references to ''micro-evolution,'' changes within organisms that ''people can see,'' like bacteria becoming disease-resistant.
