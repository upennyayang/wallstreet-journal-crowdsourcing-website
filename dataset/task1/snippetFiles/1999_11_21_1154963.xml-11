	George W. Bush has been attacked for his lack of academic achievement in college. ''According to the Yale document,'' wrote Jane Mayer and Alexandra Robbins in The New Yorker, citing school records, ''Bush was a C student. (This, of course, was in a preinflationary time, the waning era of the gentleman's C.)'' Bush, in self-deprecation, earlier used the phrase, saying, ''That's the difference between a Phi Beta Kappa and a gentleman's C.''
	Dictionaries are no help in tracking down that phrase. Earliest use I can find is in a 1959 Journal of Negro Education about bright students ''poorly motivated, content to be a 'gentleman's C.''' The quotation marks indicate earlier usage. In 1973, Richard Merelman wrote in the University of Texas's Journal of Politics, ''Although such ascriptive practices as the gentleman's C are now dying out, the antiquated image of education they reflect -- a view that education should legitimize a social aristocracy by providing it with marks of status -- remains embedded in the schools.'' (Whoever supplies the origin of this phrase will get a helluva grade from me.)
	This department will try to stay on top of the Americanisms cascading out of the 2000 campaign.
