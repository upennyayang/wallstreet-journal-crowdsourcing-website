	Dr. Ronald Hamilton of the University of Pittsburgh and Dr. Kenneth Fallon of West Virginia University confirmed Omalu's findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a condition evidenced by neurofibrillary tangles in the brain's cortex, which can cause memory loss, depression and eventually Alzheimer's disease-like dementia. ''This is extremely abnormal in a 36-year-old,'' Hamilton said. ''If I didn't know anything about this case and I looked at the slides, I would have asked, 'Was this patient a boxer?' ''
	The discovery of a fourth player with chronic traumatic encephalopathy will most likely be discussed when N.F.L. officials and medical personnel meet in Chicago on Tuesday for an unprecedented conference regarding concussion management. The league and its players association have consistently played down findings on individual players like Strzelczyk as anecdotal, and widespread survey research of retired players with depression and early Alzheimer's disease as of insufficient scientific rigor.
	The N.F.L. spokesman Greg Aiello said that the league had no comment on the Strzelczyk findings. Gene Upshaw, executive director of the N.F.L. Players Association, did not respond to telephone messages seeking comment.
