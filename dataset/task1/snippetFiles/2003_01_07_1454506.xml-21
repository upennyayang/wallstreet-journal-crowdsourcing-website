	Some believe that while the neural mechanisms used in computing an interception course are hard-wired in the brain, specific tasks must be learned.
	''Both dogs and humans seem to have the innate ability to track an object flying through three-dimensional space by using information in the two-dimensional image on their retina,'' Dr. Shaffer said. ''Through experience, they learn to apply this instinct to catch a ball or a Frisbee.''
	It is not surprising that the same strategy seems to be used by dogs and baseball players, said Dr. Michael Land, a researcher at the University of Sussex in England.
	''There is a lot of convergent evolution in sensory-motor tasks among very distantly related animals,'' Dr. Land said. ''For example, flies and primates can track targets with their eyes using similar basic strategies, though those of primates are more elaborate.''
	Dr. Land's colleague Dr. Thomas Collett, who has worked with him on studies of male flies' intercepting females, thinks that navigational behavior involves a combination of instinct and experience. ''The mix depends on where you are in the animal kingdom,'' he said. ''In flies, it is likely that the behavior is mostly preprogrammed.
