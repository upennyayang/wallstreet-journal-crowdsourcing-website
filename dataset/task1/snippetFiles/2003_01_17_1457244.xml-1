	Feathered dinosaurs may have done something similar, Dr. Kenneth P. Dial of the University of Montana suggests in today's issue of Science. He suggests that they too flapped their primitive wings to help them climb, which brought them off the ground and closer to discovering the aerial possibilities of their wings. Even incompletely feathered proto-wings, Dr. Dial says, would have been useful in running up inclines.
	One of Dr. Dial's findings, which has surprised other scientists who study the evolution of flight, is that the chukar chicks did not use their wings to raise them off the ground. The wing beats served the same purpose as spoilers on race cars. The force generated by flapping pressed the chicks into the surface on which they were running for better traction. As Dr. Dial said of his finding, ''It's not intuitive.''
	In fact, he came upon the behavior accidentally. His teenage son, Terry, was helping him study the development of flight in chukar chicks. While Dr. Dial was traveling, his son was keeping track of the young birds as their feathers grew, and they gradually launched themselves on longer flights, horizontally and vertically.
