	''I'd love to see this guy do some Hubble diagrams,'' Dr. Riess said. Even if Dr. Dvali could be coaxed into providing a prediction, however, success in identifying the dark energy was not guaranteed to the astronomers. Calling himself a spokesman for the ''cranky point of view,'' Dr. Steinhardt pointed out that the oft-proclaimed era of ''precision cosmology'' was bound to have its limits. Other cosmological parameters, particularly the cosmic density of matter in the universe, were not likely to be known well enough for even SNAP to untangle the models in which the quintessence varied over time. Worried that the overselling of SNAP could sap astronomers' will to come up with new ideas, he said, ''We should try to make as few pronouncements as possible.'' Dr. Turner refused to be swayed from his ''irrational exuberance.'' Appealing to the astronomers' pride, he urged them to be ambitious. ''We have a chance to do fundamental physics here,'' he said. ''Let's see if we can crack this nut. Maybe we'll fall on our faces. Maybe cranky Paul is right. ''I still have a lot of youthful juices in my body.''
