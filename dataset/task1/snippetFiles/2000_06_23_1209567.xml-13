	If the presence of subsurface water was proved, Dr. Weiler said, it could fuel a desire to send humans to Mars. Water would make a human trip more feasible and economical because it could be used to make oxygen for astronauts to breathe and hydrogen for fuel for the return trip to Earth. But a human trip would only come after extensive robot missions to characterize the planet and find the best landing sites, he said, an effort that could take decades.
	Dr. Bruce Jakosky, director of the Center for Astrobiology at Colorado University, said the key to finding life on Mars was liquid water. The new findings, possibly finding water where least expected, shows that Mars will be more difficult to understand than some scientists have believed and that any life that might be there could be in unexpected places.
	''On Earth,'' Dr. Jakosky said, ''wherever you find liquid water below the boiling temperature, then you find life.'' The latest discovery ''doesn't tell us that life does exist on Mars, but it is the smoking gun that tells us Mars has all of the elements for life,'' he said.
