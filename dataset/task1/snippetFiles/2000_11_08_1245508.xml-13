	After receiving a master's degree in public health from Columbia -- which she says will be especially valuable in her new job -- Dr. Marx worked at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center and North Central Bronx Hospital, teaching residents and seeing mostly poor patients. She has worked part time since her daughters -- Adina, 10, and Charlotte, 8 -- were born. In her spare time, she said, ''I hang with my kids,'' playing board games, supervising their scooter rides in Central Park and on one recent weekend, passing out leaflets on behalf of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
	Dr. Marx and her husband, the director of the pediatric H.I.V. program at St. Luke's-Roosevelt, became friends with Mr. Levy when they lived in the same building on Riverside Drive in the early 1990's. Nor is she the first of Mr. Levy's Upper West Side friends to be joining the Board of Education payroll -- David Klasfeld, the deputy chancellor, and Jonathan Levi, a special assistant to the chancellor, preceded her.
	She is cagey when asked how long she intends to stay on the job, making clear that she intends to return to clinic work in the not-too-distant future.
