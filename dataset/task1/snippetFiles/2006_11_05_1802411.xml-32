	For large-scale wind farm developers, subsidies and public policies that assure that every kilowatt of wind power will have a buyer help bridge the cost-per-kilowatt gap. The largest tax offset, the production tax credit, allows developers and investors to recoup capital costs more quickly once turbines are producing. But the credit expires at the end of 2007. While the wind industry expects Congress to extend it, slowness could hamstring projects. Congress has let the credit lapse three times in the past, each time causing a virtual cessation of projects until it was reinstated. LIPA and FPL want to complete construction of the South Shore turbines in 2009; various federal approvals are needed. Project supporters say the tax credit would be passed along to customers, but critics see a bonanza for FPL, the world's largest wind farm owner and operator. ''They are going to have federal tax credits all over the place,'' said Philip Healey, a Save Jones Beach member from Massapequa. ''They're not doing this because it's a noble cause. They want their money back.'' Richard M. Kessel, LIPA's chairman, says that turbine opponents are reaching for any monkey wrench available.
