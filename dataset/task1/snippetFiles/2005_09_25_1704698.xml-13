	The pointed finger, now a symbol of unfair accusation, began its metaphoric rise in 1829 as the finger of scorn: ''It was a shame,'' wrote Pierce Egan in his British fisticuffs serial, ''Boxiana,'' ''that pure and honorable men should be suspected of such doings. . .for even at him the finger of scorn had been pointed.'' Then as now, the phrase was an attack on those making charges.
	The rhyming blame game has now surpassed the scornful finger, even in this digital age. Who started it? The British critic Kenneth Tynan in 1958 described ''the worst of domestic rituals, the Blame Game. I blame my agony on you; you blame yours on her; she blames hers on me.''
	Perhaps the phrase first appeared in a letter to a columnist named Geraldine in the Nov. 27, 1937, Oakland Tribune, as New Deal controversy grew: ''The educated call the rest of the world moron. . .while the workers claim the work is too hard and the idle say it's not enough.'' Memorably, the anonymous writer concluded, ''Let's beat the 'blame' game by thinking deeply, talking sensibly and blaming sparsely.''
