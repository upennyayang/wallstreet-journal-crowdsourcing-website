	But the mysteries of Ms. Meinhof's mind were apparently of lasting interest, her daughter said.
	Shortly after Ms. Meinhof died, Ms. Röhl said, her brain was studied at a clinic at the university in Tübingen, on the orders of a prosecutor. The doctors found evidence of neurological abnormalities, which Ms. Röhl says could have been used as mitigating evidence in her trial.
	The condition of Ms. Meinhof's brain had been an issue because of damage she sustained during an operation for a tumor in 1962. The abnormalities found by the doctors in Tübingen, Ms. Röhl contends, might have enabled her lawyers to argue that she was suffering from diminished mental capacity.
	In 1997, Ms. Röhl said, the brain was moved to Magdeburg University, where a researcher is comparing it with the brain of a multiple killer. The rector of the university, Klaus Pollman, told Agence France-Presse that the brain was almost certainly there, preserved in formaldehyde.
	Mr. Pollman said the brain was probably in the care of a doctor, Bernhard Bogerts. He said he had been unable to ask Dr. Bogerts about it because he was traveling to Germany from the United States.
