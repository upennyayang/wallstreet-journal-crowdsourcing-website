	''We see features that look like gullies formed by flowing water and the deposits of soil and rocks transported by these flows,'' said Dr. Malin, whose company built the spacecraft camera that made the images. ''These features appear to be so young that they might be forming today.''
	At a news conference today at NASA headquarters, the researchers said there was ample evidence that water once flowed on Mars in abundance, leaving ancient river beds and the markings of huge oceans. One of the big questions about Mars, Dr. Edgett said, has been, ''Where did the water go?''
	''The new pictures from Global Surveyor tell us part of the answer,'' he said. ''Some of that water went underground, and quite possibly it's still there.''
	The researchers, whose study will be published next week in the journal Science, said that they found evidence for the flow of liquid water in 150 of 65,000 photos taken by the Surveyor's high resolution camera over the last two years. The evidence of water movement, in the form of gullies and channels terminating in fan-like deltas, appears recent because surfaces around these features are smooth and relatively light in color.
