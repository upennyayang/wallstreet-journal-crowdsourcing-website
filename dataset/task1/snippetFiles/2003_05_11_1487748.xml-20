	Stephen Dealler received his first phone call from Don Simms in January 2002. Don had read Dealler's papers and wanted to try PPS on his son. As Dealler told him, however, there was a daunting technical challenge. PPS molecules were so big that if they were administered by any of the standard means -- intravenously, or in a pill -- they would not be able to pass from the bloodstream into the brain. ''We have no way to deliver it,'' Dealler remembers saying. He wished Don well and thought that would be the last he would hear from him.
	Weeks later, Don called again. In the interim, he had been frantically busy. He'd read about a doctor in Bristol who had created a pump to inject drugs directly into the brains of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Don contacted this researcher, only to be told that the pump was designed to target two select sites in the brain - useful for Parkinson's but not for variant C.J.D., which affects the entire brain. But the Bristol doctor directed Don to Liverpool, where he found Dr. Nikolai Rainov, a neurosurgeon and a world expert on delivering cancer drugs directly to the brain.
