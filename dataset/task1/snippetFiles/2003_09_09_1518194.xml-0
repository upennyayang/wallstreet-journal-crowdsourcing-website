	Symbiotic Ne'er-Do-Wells Symbiotic relationships are often thought of as idyllic situations, mini-utopias where the I-scratch-your-back-you-scratch-mine ethos functions perfectly, to both parties' satisfaction. The reality, though, is that there are slackers everywhere. Even among symbionts there are cheats that give nothing, letting their neighbors do all the work, but get plenty from their hosts in return. So in cases like these, what keeps the symbiotic relationship from falling apart? Researchers from the University of California at Davis and the University of Edinburgh have investigated one relationship from the plant world with an eye on that question. Their answer is: The host plant cracks down on the ne'er-do-wells. The researchers studied the interaction between soybean plants and bacteria called rhizobia that thrive in nodules in their roots. The bacteria turn atmospheric nitrogen into a form that the plant can use and get nutrients in return. But among the rhizobia that exist on soybean plants there are many strains that cheat, producing little or no nitrogen. In their experiments, described in the current issue of Nature, the researchers created cheater bacteria by replacing normal air with an almost nitrogen-free mix of gases.
