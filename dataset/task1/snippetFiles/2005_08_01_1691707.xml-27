	Dr. Griffin has won early points in Washington for his openness about the shuttle's problems. ''He's decisive,'' said Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York, who is chairman of the House Science Committee.
	Last week, Mr. Boehlert noted, Dr. Griffin did not hesitate in saying that future missions would be suspended until the source of the latest foam-shedding was understood. ''Some others would have tried to finesse that for a while,'' he said. ''He didn't.''
	But if the next decision is to keep the shuttles on the ground, the man who prides himself in staying out of politics will run headlong into it. In places that count politically, especially Texas and Florida, the shuttle is a source of jobs and pride. ''If you love the shuttle,'' Mr. Boehlert said, ''chances are you come from a district that keeps it flying.''
	Moreover, Mr. Bush, who paid relatively scant attention to space policy before the Columbia disaster and has rarely mentioned it since he gave a speech at NASA laying out the vision that Dr. Griffin is following, does not want to be remembered as a president who left the space program in disarray.
