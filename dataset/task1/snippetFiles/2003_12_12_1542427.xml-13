	The authors of the Science article note that many of the human genes they found to have undergone accelerated evolution turn up in the list of Mendelian diseases, those caused by defects in a single gene. The reason for that curious association could be that the genes serve new functions, ones that emerged so recently that evolution has not had time to install backups, Dr. Clark said. The authors of the report conducted the first genomewide comparison of human and chimp genes, but for technical reasons were able to test for accelerated evolution in fewer than 8,000 of the 30,000 or so genes in the two genomes. Dr. Clark said the statistical power of the test for evolutionary acceleration was limited and would fail to detect any that might have occurred in shorter genes. ''It's exciting how much you are able to illumine the difference between humans and chimps,'' he said. But the differences at the genetic level need to be checked in terms of biology. Only in rare cases like that of FOXP2 is the link between the accelerated genes and actual biology more than a guess at present.
