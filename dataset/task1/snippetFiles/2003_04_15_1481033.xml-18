	A prime beneficiary of the essentially completed genome is DeCode Genetics of Reykjavik, Iceland, which is screening the entire Icelandic population for disease-causing variant genes. Dr. Kari Stefansson, the president of the company, said the single base variants known as SNP's were now accurately assigned on the genome sequence 99 percent of the time, compared with 93 percent accuracy previously. The SNP's, which make one person's genome different from another's, are helpful in pinpointing errant genes providing that the position of the SNP's on the genome is known with accuracy.
	Dr. Stefansson said the current version of the human genome was ''absolutely wonderful to have'' but that it was ''silly'' to claim it was completed.
	Two laboratory organisms whose genomes were sequenced as pilot projects for the human genome, the C. elegans roundworm and the Drosophila fruit fly, are in a more complete state than the human genome. Every single base of the roundworm genome is known.
	The principal contributors to the human genome sequence are the Sanger Institute near Cambridge in England, which has done 30 percent of the sequence, the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., and the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University in St. Louis.
