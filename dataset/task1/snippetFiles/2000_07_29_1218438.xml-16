	Groups like People for the American Way sponsored a re-enactment of the Scopes ''monkey trial'' at the University of Kansas this month, starring Ed Asner, a native Kansan. Proponents of nonevolutionary theories, like Phillip Johnson, a University of California law professor who believes in ''intelligent design,'' have donated money to conservative candidates. Local groups have formed to defend or attack the board's vote, including a political action committee helping conservative candidates.
	Some Democrats have switched parties just for Tuesday's primary.
	''I think this election is so critical to Kansas children that I was compelled to suck it up and change parties,'' said Lois Culver, 69, of Overland Park. Mrs. Culver, who said she saw the new standards as an effort to put religion in the schools, plans to vote for Sue Gamble, a moderate Republican, and then rejoin the Democratic Party.
	Mrs. Gamble, a member of the Shawnee Mission school board, said the new standards could ''put students at a disadvantage on a national level.''
	''You need to know about dinosaurs, the age of the earth,'' she said.
	She said she worried that ''students from out of state won't want to come here and study because they feel the standards won't be up to snuff.''
