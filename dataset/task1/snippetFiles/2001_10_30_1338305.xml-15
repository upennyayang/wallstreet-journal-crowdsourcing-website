	Q. Should we be organizing conservation programs for endangered languages in the same way we do for wildlife and plants?
	A. Ideally we'd like to keep all 5,000 languages. Just as every creature is this marvelous repository of nature's wonders, if you look at any language, you are dazzled by its richness and complexity. This is especially true if you go way off into the jungle and find a language spoken by some 300 people. That language is going to be unbelievably complex because it has had thousands of years in isolation to get that way.
	But globalization seems to be inevitable. And what's even more inevitable is that people who are living in primitive conditions, once they're exposed to first-world lives, tend to want them. To the extent third-world people are joining the globalized world, it seems that many of these languages are doomed, at least in their spoken form. What I urge is that these languages be recorded so that we will always know what they were like. I think all linguists should record at least one endangered language as part of their career.
