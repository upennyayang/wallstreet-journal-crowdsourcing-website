	At press time on Saturday, Dr. Dean's stock in the Iowa caucuses market at Intrade.com was listed at 45, meaning that investors gave him a 45 percent chance to win the caucuses tomorrow. Next was Representative Richard A. Gephardt at 25 percent, followed by Senator John Kerry at 20 and Senator John Edwards at 8. .
	Dr. Dean also remained the favorite to be the eventual nominee on another exchange, the Iowa Electronic Markets. Traders yesterday gave him a 51 percent chance to win, putting him well ahead of Gen. Wesley K. Clark (21 percent) and Mr. Kerry (13 percent). This exchange has been run since 1988 by the University of Iowa's business school, which says its futures market has usually been more accurate than public opinion polls at predicting election results.
	Nice Counts In Informal Poll
	In an exclusive Political Points poll with no history whatsoever of accuracy, we can report that Senator Kerry is the clear favorite among the waiters, bartenders and hotel workers in Des Moines who have been tending to the various candidates for more than a year. No man may be a hero to his valet, but Mr. Kerry is at least a mensch to these workers.
