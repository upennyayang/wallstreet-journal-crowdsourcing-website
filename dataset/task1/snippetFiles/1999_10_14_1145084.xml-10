	And when you reach the last ring, your tent, you can push through the flap and move around inside, where there is a laptop computer on the desk ready to connect to the Nature Web site. Neat.
	The goal is to shoot videos of all the animals at each campsite and use the images and information you have collected to complete Dr. Carp's studies about animal fashion (the leopard's spots or zebra's stripes, for example), body parts (an elephant's trunk) and other topics.

	Ready to move on to a new place? Hop in the Land Rover or the cockpit of your plane, pull up a map of southern Kenya and choose your destination. The reward for finishing the studies is a hot-air balloon ride over the Masai Mara. I didn't get that far on my first trip, but I'll be back.
	As George Page says, ''Safari enjema,'' which is Masai for ''have a good safari.'' LIBRARY/RECENT RELEASES
