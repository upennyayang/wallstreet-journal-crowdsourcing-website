	But the process of transforming the joint human-chimp ancestor, who was probably a very chimpanzeelike creature, into a human seems much more complicated in light of the new analysis. In a preliminary screen, Dr. Clark and his colleagues have found that a large number of genes shows signs of accelerated evolution in the human lineage. Those are genes that, by a statistical test applied to changes in their DNA, appear to be under strong recent pressure of natural selection and so are likely to be those that make humans differ from chimpanzees. A prominent set of accelerated human genes are those involved in hearing, particularly the gene that makes a protein called alpha-tectorin, a component of the tectorial membrane of the inner ear. Dr. Clark suggests that the genes governing speech and hearing are most likely to have evolved in parallel and that evolutionary tweaks in the alpha-tectorin gene may make humans hear somewhat differently from chimps. Another group of selected genes is involved in brain development. Of particular interest is SEMA3B, which helps guide growing nerve axons to the proper regions in the brain. Differences in the human version might help explain the different wiring in the two brains, Dr. Clark said.
