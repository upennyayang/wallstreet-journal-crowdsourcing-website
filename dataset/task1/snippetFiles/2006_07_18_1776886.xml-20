	Using a special laser-scanning microscope, the researchers discovered biofilms -- bacteria bound together by a slimy substance -- covering the grains. DNA analysis found up to 30 species of bacteria.
	One DNA sequence, almost certainly from a species called Ralstonia metallidurans, was found on most of the grains. Researchers performed tests and found that it could precipitate gold out of a solution.
	While the evidence is not conclusive, it strongly suggests that R. metallidurans is creating and adding to gold grains. The soils where the grains were found lie over gold-containing rocks. Gold is dissolved out of them by moisture, which then leaches upward into the soil, where the bacteria can get at it.
	Dr. Reith said that it was likely that bacterial gold deposition was a continuing process, and that grains built up over time. Even large nuggets, he said, could be the result of accumulation.
	Dr. Reith said mining companies were interested in the finding for two reasons. First, it raises the possibility that micro-organisms might someday be used to process gold. Second, it might be useful in exploration: a biosensor that could detect the presence of the bacteria could lead prospectors to gold.
