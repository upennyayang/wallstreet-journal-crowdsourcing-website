	NATURE: VIRTUAL SERENGETI (Grolier Interactive; $29.99; Windows 95 and 98, and Macintosh; for ages 9 and older.)
	SERENGETI: a magical name that is synonymous with primeval Africa and evokes indelible images of one of the greatest wildlife spectacles on Earth -- unless, of course, you never watch the nature programs on television. The word springs from the Masai language and means ''an extended place.'' The world-famous Serengeti National Park in Tanzania covers 5,700 square miles of grassy plains that are broken here and there by granite islands called kopjes, savannahs that are lightly cloaked with thorn trees, saline lakes where flamingos feed on minute organisms and other habitats, all with their own unique animal populations.
	But like Yellowstone in North America, the park is incomplete. The whole Serengeti ecosystem, as defined by the migration route of a million ox-like antelopes called wildebeests (gnus to crossword puzzle fans), is the size of the country of Kuwait and extends into the Masai Mara Game Reserve just across the Kenyan border.
	It seems odd, then, that Nature: Virtual Serengeti, a CD-ROM spinoff from the PBS television program, never sets foot in Tanzania.
