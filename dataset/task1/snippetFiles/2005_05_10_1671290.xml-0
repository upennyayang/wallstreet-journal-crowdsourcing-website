	Specialties in the social sciences are proliferating at a record pace, and the job title of Dr. Robert Boyd illustrates that point perfectly.
	Dr. Boyd is a theoretical biological anthropologist: he uses mathematics and deduction to develop ideas about how Homo sapiens became earth's dominant species.
	Over a 30-year career, Dr. Boyd, 57, of the University of California, Los Angeles, has made it his task to show how contemporary human behavior is rooted in the cultures that humans developed as they lived the evolutionary process.
	In the recent book ''Not by Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution,'' Dr. Boyd and his co-author, an environmental scientist, explained why culture was ''essential to human adaptation, as much a part of human biology as bipedal locomotion.''
	Q. Your book is called ''Not by Genes Alone.'' Why that title?
	A. We wanted to call it ''The Nature of Culture,'' but our publishers, wouldn't have it. They didn't want us stuck on the social science shelves at the bookstore, where books generally don't do well.
	The book is a synthesis of current thinking on the role culture plays in human evolution.
