	Even in an industry much attached to hyperbole, few companies have excited such high hopes. Investors include the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which granted the Institute for OneWorld Health $42.6 million to finance Amyris's antimalarial drug, and two princes of Silicon Valley venture capital, John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, and Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures, who, with the private equity group of Texas Pacific Group Ventures, invested $20 million.
	Explaining his interest in the start-up, Mr. Khosla told me: ''Amyris was using a very sexy technology and applying it in a radical way to malarial drugs. When I asked the question, 'Can you do the same for energy?' the surprising answer was, 'Yes, we can.' ''
	Mr. Doerr said he thought that green technologies ''could be the largest economic opportunity of the 21st century.'' He called Amyris ''the best team to do this kind of work.''
	Amyris's technology derives from the research of Jay D. Keasling, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, and the director of the synthetic biology department of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Mr. Keasling's lab is widely credited with making commercially practical an emerging technology called metabolic engineering.
