	Mr. Sullivan said that the same studies that showed serious cardiovascular problems for Vioxx and Bextra showed that Celebrex often caused irregular heartbeats. The arrhythmia problems were serious enough to justify charges of false advertising when Pfizer suggested that Celebrex was safe, according to lawsuits Mr. Sullivan has filed.
	A new round of television and print advertising for Celebrex appeared in late October and early November, promoting it as better than over-the-counter pain medications. Pfizer said at the time that the new ads had been in the works well before the Vioxx withdrawal and were not intended to capitalize on Merck's woes.
	Lawyers with experience in drug litigation said that the cases were far more straightforward in the long run than mass torts like asbestos or tobacco. They typically involve just one manufacturer and a well-defined product about which there are huge amounts of public data. ''There are a lot of private documents, but it's easy to get your hands around,'' said David W. Field, a defense lawyer in Roseland, N.J., who is not involved in COX-2 cases. ''The issue always comes down to whether you were candid with the F.D.A.''
