	Not everyone is satisfied.
	Dr. Eric Lander, a molecular biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was one of the leaders in the Human Genome Project, said, ''Science magazine seems confused about the purpose of scientific publication.''
	''If authors can restrict the ways that readers can use knowledge,'' Dr. Lander added, ''the pace of discovery will be slowed and the public will lose,''
	Others objected that the Celera agreement could be setting a dangerous precedent for the Balkanization of databases. They said they should be able to go to one place -- GenBank -- to compare genetic data.
	''Some say that if Celera wants to publish, they should make their data available on that basis,'' Dr. David Baltimore, a molecular biologist and president of the California Institute of Technology, said. ''They say that if the need for commercialization is so important, then don't publish. Don't get the accolades of publication.''
	Correction: December 9, 2000, Saturday Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about Celera Genomics' plan to make its genome data freely available to researchers while charging companies for access omitted part of a quotation by Dr. David Baltimore, a molecular biologist, in some editions.
