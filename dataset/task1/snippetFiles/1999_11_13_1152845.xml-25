	Tey Diana Rebolledo, a professor of Spanish at the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque who published an anthology of literature of Mexican-American women, said Mr. Stavans panned Ms. Cisneros ''in kind of nasty ways.'' Yet even those with mixed feelings about Mr. Stavans see his presence as beneficial. ''He's opening doors to publishing houses and institutions where U.S. Hispanic literature has not entered before,'' said Nicolas Kanellos, the director of Arte Publico Press in Houston, the largest publisher of Hispanic literature in the United States. Mr. Kanellos said Norton never answered his letter in the early 1990's when he approached them about a 10-year project that he is coordinating with scholars nationwide to recover, index and publish lost Latino writings in a series of books. (The Norton anthology will be a single volume of about 2,200 pages.) Rolando Hinojosa-Smith, a professor of English at the University of Texas at Austin, insists Mr. Stavans deserves the attention that he is getting. ''If people complain, then they should sit down and produce,'' said Mr. Hinojosa-Smith, who will edit the contemporary Mexican-American section of the upcoming Norton book.
