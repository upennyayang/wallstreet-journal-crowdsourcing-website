	And although Toyota and Honda assemble in the United States most of the cars they sell here, their plants are much newer, their work forces younger and their retirees number in the hundreds, not the hundreds of thousands that depend on the Big Three. They are also not unionized, except in joint ventures with the Big Three.
	While the out-of-pocket health costs of auto workers have not risen in years, many American workers have seen quite the opposite, and even white-collar Big Three employees can pay several hundred dollars a month in premiums and other out-of-pocket expenses. Auto union members enrolled in H.M.O.'s and P.P.O.'s generally pay $10 or less for prescriptions or visits to the doctor. Everything else is covered.
	As a result, many analysts think that the domestic auto industry is in a bind similar to the one that crippled the domestic steel industry. Both feature shrinking companies burdened with health and pension obligations to armies of retirees, as well as labor contracts originating in a time of much less global competition.
	Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton University health care economist, calls the Big Three ''a social insurance system that sells cars to finance itself.''
