	Opinions here vary about how much the society should worry, if at all, about this exercise and spiritual group. It had attracted millions including, obviously, some who became entranced. By mobilizing more than 10,000 people for an unauthorized demonstration in April 1999, it seemed to the leaders of this one-party state a potential political threat. Still, the unending campaign to outlaw and demonize the group appears to have been counterproductive in some ways.
	Late last week, a university professor who dislikes Falun Gong and who was appalled by the attempted suicides, asked, ''Are the foreign papers reporting what ours can't, how the severe persecution of believers may have driven these people to this act?''
	When they mounted that first surprising demonstration in Beijing in response to criticisms that seemed obscure, Falun Gong's leaders seemed a bit prone to paranoia. Now, those who continue to practice Falun Gong have every right to fear the worst, and it appears that tens of thousands of Chinese have been left with nothing to lose.
	The old generation that runs China was shocked and angered when these nobodies pulled off a giant unauthorized demonstration right outside the executive offices two years ago.
