	''We had already been wrestling with issues of space, sound, lighting and configuration,'' Rabbi Rubinstein said. ''Although we would not have chosen the means by which this was done, there are very few times in American religious history that a congregation has the opportunity to retrofit a cathedral-type building. As awful as it was, the fire gave us this opportunity.'' Central was completed in 1872 and is the oldest building in continuous use as a synagogue in New York. Its almost fragrantly complex blend of Moorish and Victorian styles went in and out of favor over the years, and was gradually toned down. ''It doesn't have its full panoply of powers,'' said Hugh Hardy, architect of the renovation. ''We want to see that restored.'' That means reviving the dazzling, lacy stencilwork, adding chandeliers in the cusps of the horseshoe arches along the balcony and sconces under the balcony. ''When you have multiple sources of light, the whole place will shimmer,'' Mr. Hardy said. In place of the metal sheets that covered the old roof, black and red slate will be laid in geometric patterns. Decorative cresting will be restored to the parapets and the copper globes atop the twin towers will be highlighted in gold leaf.
