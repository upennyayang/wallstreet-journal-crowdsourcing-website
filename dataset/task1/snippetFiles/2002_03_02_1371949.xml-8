	This mission is the first for the Columbia after an extensive overhaul that included a new cockpit. NASA is reviewing its records to see if something done in the overhaul could have contributed to the problem. The Columbia, at 21, is the oldest of the four shuttles in NASA's fleet. Its last flight, in April 1999, was marred by a small fuel leak and a short circuit that knocked out computer controllers for two of the three main engines just after liftoff.
	Though today's launching had been delayed a day by cold weather, everything was problem-free at dawn, when the shuttle pierced through low clouds over the Kennedy Space Center as its target, the 12.5-ton Hubble telescope, passed overhead. Only when the Columbia was in orbit did the astronauts report a couple of technical problems. One, a balky hatch, was resolved quickly.
	But flight controllers also detected a lower than expected flow of freon in one of the systems that cool the shuttle through tubing in the open payload bay doors.
	NASA has extended the life of the 12-year-old Hubble, one of astronomy's most useful telescopes, by regularly upgrading its instruments.
