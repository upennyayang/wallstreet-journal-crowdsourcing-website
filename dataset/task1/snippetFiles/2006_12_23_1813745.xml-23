	Tooling around town in a small, white Renault sedan with a special plate in the windshield, he parks wherever he wants -- even on the cobblestone walkway at Notre-Dame and on the quay in front of the Musée d'Orsay.
	He rattles off details about lighting history: how the adorning of Paris in light began in the 14th century when Philip V the Tall ordered candles to be lighted in three sites every night, how the Paris lamppost was invented in the 18th century, how one way Paris earned the nickname City of Light was from the artificial electrical light displays at the Paris Fair of 1900.
	He recalls the time a few years back when he and a team were experimenting with light on Sacré Coeur Basilica in Montmartre and colored it mauve. ''The priest came running out and ordered us to turn it off,'' Mr. Jousse said. ''We just wanted to have some fun. But Paris is a very serious city.''
	The 20,000 flashing lights of the Eiffel Tower (they dazzle for 10 minutes every hour on the hour until after 1 a.m.) are, for him, ''a visual clock, like the bell of a church -- every hour the light sounds the hour.''
