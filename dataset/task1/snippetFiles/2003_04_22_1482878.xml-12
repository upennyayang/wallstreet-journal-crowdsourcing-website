	The researchers, who reported on their work in the March 28 issue of Science, used data from the Harvard Forest, an experimental tract in central Massachusetts. Comparing data from cloudless days in 1992 and 1993 to cloudless days in later years (when the aerosol effect of the Pinatubo eruption had dissipated), they estimated that noontime photosynthesis increased by 23 percent in 1992 and by 8 percent in 1993.
	Because increased photosynthesis results in increased absorption of carbon dioxide, the researchers say their findings suggest that the greater light scattering caused by Pinatubo contributed to a measured decline in the rate of growth of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the two years that followed.
	A Rare Killing
	With few natural predators, cougars and wolves usually leave each other alone. So a recent report by a Wildlife Conservation Society biologist, Toni Ruth, is stunning: a cougar in Yellowstone National Park was killed by a pack of wolves.
	The cougar was outfitted with a radio collar so its movements could be tracked. When it stopped moving for a day, researchers located it and found it dead from a wolf attack. While wolves sometimes harass cougars in an effort to steal their food, actual killings of them are extremely rare.
