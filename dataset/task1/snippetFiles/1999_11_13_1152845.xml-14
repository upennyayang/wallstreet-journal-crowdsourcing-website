	Mr. Stavans admits that the complications of identity did not occur to him when he was a fair-haired boy watching ''Star Trek'' on television in Mexico City. It was not until he went to college there that he realized how little he knew about his country. Then he rejected his Jewish roots and went backpacking across Mexico and Cuba.
	''I wanted to have the least to do with Jews as possible,'' said Mr. Stavans, a gentle-mannered man with wire-rimmed glasses. ''I wanted to integrate and become Mexican.''
	But Mr. Stavans found that the more that he tried to become like everyone else, the more he felt different. He dropped out of college after two years to embark on a Hemingwayesque life as a writer in Spain, England and Israel. He eventually returned to Mexico City to complete his undergraduate studies in psychology, appeasing parents who wanted him to have a backup if writing did not succeed.
	Mr. Stavans was already writing under his father's stage name when he moved to New York in 1985. He enrolled at the Jewish Theological Seminary, where he met his wife, Alison Sparks Stavchansky, who is a speech pathologist.
