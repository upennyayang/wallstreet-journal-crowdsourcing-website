	''What happens when you squeeze too much information into an object is that you pack more and more energy in,'' Dr. Bousso said. But if it gets too heavy for its size, it becomes a black hole, and then ''the game is over,'' as he put it. ''Like a piano with lots of keys but you can't press more than five of them at once or the piano will collapse.''
	The holographic principle, first suggested by Dr. 't Hooft in 1993 and elaborated by Dr. Susskind a year later, says in effect that if you can't use the other piano keys, they aren't really there. ''We had a completely wrong picture of the piano,'' explained Dr. Bousso. The normal theories that physics uses to describe events in space-time are redundant in some surprising and as yet mysterious way. ''We clearly see the world the way we see a hologram,'' Dr. Bousso said. ''We see three dimensions. When you look at one of those chips, it looks pretty real, but in our case the illusion is perfect.''
	Dr. Susskind added: ''We don't read the hologram. We are the hologram.''
