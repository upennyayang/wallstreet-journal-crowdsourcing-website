	In Azerbaijan the lawlessness begins at sea and continues inland. Two fish shops display sturgeon hanging along the shoulder of the main road into Nardaran. One shop had eight osetra and four large sevruga sturgeon visible on a recent day, and a tank holding several live sturgeon. A police car with two officers was parked across the street. (A shop employee pushed a photographer away by the lens when he tried taking pictures.)
	In Baku's main bazaar, osetra sturgeon are stacked like logs in public view, and illegal caviar is sold beside pomegranates and dried fruits. Every restaurant of 12 surveyed served fresh sturgeon -- grilled, baked, stewed or in soups. Even ordering unspecified fish or chowder in Azeri restaurants often turns up dishes with sturgeon meat.
	Moreover, Ali said he supplied part of his catch to an official, state-sanctioned fish business that then exported ''legal'' caviar to the West. This gives him a cover, he said, and launders much of his catch, which ends up in the West with the imprimatur of legitimacy. He declined to name the business. The Azeri official, Mr. Gadjiyev, said he did not believe such claims.
