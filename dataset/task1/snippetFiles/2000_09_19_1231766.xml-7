	In the 1960's, researchers showed that certain drugs could interfere with the recall of memories, he said, but the research did not get very far because the drugs affected the entire brain and could not be traced to cellular mechanisms in memory networks.
	Dr. Karim Nader and Dr. Glenn Shafe, research assistant professors at N.Y.U., carried out the new experiments on memory recall in ways that reveal those cellular mechanisms with much greater precision. In a process called fear conditioning, they simultaneously played a tone and delivered an electric shock to the feet of caged rats. Later, when the rats heard just the tone, they froze; they had learned to be afraid.
	Researchers know exactly how and where this fear memory is hardwired in the rat's amygdala, a part of the brain that processes emotions.
	If the rat's amygdala is injected with a drug that blocks protein synthesis shortly after fear conditioning, it does not acquire long-term memory of the fear, Dr. Shafe said.
	But if the drug is injected six or more hours later, the memory is not blocked; the brain has made new proteins to consolidate and store the memory.
