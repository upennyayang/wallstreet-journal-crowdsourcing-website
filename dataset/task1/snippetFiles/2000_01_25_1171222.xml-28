	In general, Dr. Weinberg said, he believes that ''half-baked philosophy has sometimes gotten in the way of doing science.''
	And then there are his pronouncements on religion and deism, including his much-quoted aphorism, ''The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.''
	But in the seldom-cited passages that follow, Dr. Weinberg professes belief in his own kind of conviction, the idea that the scientific effort to uncover a complete theory of the universe is one of the things that can in itself add dignity and meaning to human existence.
	As for conventional religion, though, his views are uncompromising: it is not only silly but damaging to human civilization. ''The whole history of the last thousands of years has been a history of religious persecutions and wars, pogroms, jihads, crusades,'' he said. ''I find it all very regrettable, to say the least.''
	Actually, Dr. Weinberg does occasionally entertain the possibility that there might be a God. While sitting in his study, with its striking view of Lake Austin, he imagined himself in the role of the biblical Abraham, whose faith God tested by commanding that he sacrifice his own son.
