	They calculated that the number of droplets would increase by 20 percent, with the result that 1 percent more sunlight is reflected away from the earth. That would be enough to affect temperatures locally or perhaps regionally, the researchers said.
	Killer in the Sky
	Hollywood has given a lot of attention to killer asteroids in recent years, and people who work in science have followed suit. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is coordinating a project to identify up to 90 percent of asteroids with a diameter of one kilometer or more that are approaching Earth. Asteroids of that size could cause a civilization-altering catastrophe if they struck Earth.
	The project has a rather significant hole: it does not have any telescopes that can look for asteroids across the entire Southern sky. To rectify that, the University of Arizona and the Australian National University are collaborating to refurbish a telescope near Coonabarabran, in southeastern Australia.
	The refurbished telescope, like all modern asteroid-seeking instruments, will use a charge-coupled device, which makes electronic images of the sky. Astronomers take images of the same part of the sky over several minutes and then compare them.
