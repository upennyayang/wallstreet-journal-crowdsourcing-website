	The imaging of bonds was achieved by a team of chemists and physicists at Arizona State University, Tempe, headed by Dr. John C. H. Spence and Dr. Jian-Min Zuo, and financed by the National Science Foundation. Their technique, using beams of both X-rays and electrons to probe molecules, was the first system capable of imaging both the atoms in a crystal lattice and the electron bonds holding them together.
	It was once thought that an atom was like a miniature solar system, with planetary electrons orbiting a spherical sunlike nucleus. But since the development of quantum mechanics in the 1920's, scientists have known that a more realistic way of thinking about atomic electrons is to plot the regions in space where each of an atom's electrons is most likely to be found. The shapes and sizes of these regions, called orbitals, are determined by the electrons' energies and three other quantum properties.
	The all-important orbitals of an atom define how the atom can bond with other atoms. There are three main types of electronic bonds. The simplest, the metal-to-metal bond, is thought of as a sea of loose electrons holding metal atoms together.
