	Streaming white waterfalls fed by melting glaciers pour from mountains around every bend in some areas. Cliff-hugging roads are subject to mudslides and waterborne avalanches every few miles, and boulder-strewn whitewater rivers churn with uncommon ferocity.
	Dr. Thompson said he had documented large puddles of melting ice at 20,000 feet in the Himalayas, where for thousands of years all has been frozen.
	A craggy 56-year-old who says he has spent at least three years of his life at elevations of 18,000 feet or more researching glaciers, he spoke during a recent interview in Beijing. He had just completed the latest of many expeditions to Tibet over the last 20 years.
	The essence of his work involves retrieving deep ice samples, or cores, from glaciers.
	He spends much of his year like a migratory bird, traveling from one glacial mass to another, including the Himalayas and mountains in Peru, Kenya and Alaska.
	''When we go to retrieve a core, it's usually to a place that no one has ever been, and the beauty of ice, which is really different from any other material, is how much you can learn from it,'' he said.
