	Still, the dreariness did not keep many Upper Darby players from spreading eye black on their cheeks. Some dabbed a line of grease under the eyes. Some wore adhesive antiglare patches that resembled Morse code for the face. Others smeared the stuff like shaving cream. ''It's just the look,'' Brandon Murray, an Upper Darby halfback, said after his team had been upset, 20-8, by its archrival, Haverford High. ''Most kids think it's intimidating or it looks good. No one uses it to block out the light.'' That is not necessarily the case in the National Football League. Jerricho Cotchery described a scene in the Jets' locker room before a game last Sunday, when he and his fellow receiver Laveranues Coles applied eye black as if they were showgirls applying false eyelashes. They were carrying out a decades-old tradition. A Yale University study found evidence of eye black use dating at least to a 1942 photograph of a Washington Redskins player named Andy Farkas. The eye black origins in baseball are more obscure, the study said. Coles said that playing without eye-black grease was like ''playing with no shoulder pads or no helmet.''
