	MOHAMMED TOHIN, another student of Ms. Ungaro's whose essay won an award, wants to study computers so that someday he can give up his job as a hotel bartender. Since coming from Bangladesh in 1985, he has worked as a busboy and a cherry picker.
	''My father is an educated person in Bangladesh,'' he said. ''If I do not finish school, it does not matter how much I make, what matters is what I do. I do not want to disrespect my job, I'm working and making money without hurting anybody. But if I go back to Bangladesh to get married, the first question her parents want to ask is what I do. A bartender is considered in Islamic law a bad job.''
	Although Mr. Fajardo now has a better job working at a shoe store, he is restless. He wants to work on Wall Street, just like some of the people he sees at the store. They see him, too, he said.
	''Now I can talk with the clients,'' he said. ''It's a different class of people. Now we can speak about what happens on Wall Street.
	In school, he has started to find his voice.
