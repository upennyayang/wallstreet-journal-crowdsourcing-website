	Higher education was once a domain steeped in religion, where attendance at chapel services was mandatory, where church strictures governed the faculty and where college presidents were typically drawn from the clergy. The secularization of most universities has been thoroughly studied, often by scholars highlighting the loss to religion.
	C. John Sommerville, however, is less interested in any loss to religion than in the loss to the university--and its place in shaping the culture.
	A century ago, American universities aspired to be the wellsprings of political, social and cultural leadership, Mr. Sommerville, a professor emeritus, argues in ''The Decline of the Secular University,'' a slim volume published by Oxford in May and excerpted last month in The Chronicle of Higher Education.
	But today, he maintains, ''the secular university is increasingly marginal to American society,'' ceding influence to popular culture, talk show pundits, ''populist bloggers'' and political research organizations, even hiring out university laboratories to business and government in hopes of revenues from patents.
	A major reason, he contends more controversially, is the secularism that in his judgment has come to dominate academic life the way that religion previously did.
