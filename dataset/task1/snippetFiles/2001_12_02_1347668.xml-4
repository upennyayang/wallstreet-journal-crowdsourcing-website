	Ms. Monti was a sometimes skeptical, oft-times creative sidekick in Dr. Nabhan's hunting and gathering routine, but she stopped short of helping him kill the turkeys they raised in their backyard in Tucson. The spring of 1999 found them gathering cholla cactus flower buds -- a tradition carried on by the Tohono O'odham Indians for more than 500 years -- and roasting them in a pit fired with mesquite.
	They planted the seeds of tepary beans, squash, tomatoes and chilis -- local varieties that had evolved over centuries in the intense heat and long dry spells of the Sonoran Desert -- as well as seeds given them by his own family during a reunion in Lebanon, where goat cheese still tastes and smells like the wild thyme in the hilly pastures.
	There, in the Fertile Crescent, they feasted on home-grown food, he writes, ''that exuded the aroma of our aunts' and cousins' hands, the musk of goats and sheep grazed on the slopes above us, the salt and the bitter herbal bit of the alkaline earth itself.'' Ever since, he continues, ''I've carried it homeward, into every one of my body's cells.''
