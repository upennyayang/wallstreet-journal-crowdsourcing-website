	Dr. Clifasefi writes, ''After the individual screening, subjects assembled in the Behavioral Alcohol Research Lab (Barlab) at the University of Washington: a room in the psychology department designed to simulate a cocktail lounge.'' The subjects relax at the Barlab and chat among themselves. ''Can I buy you a placebo?'' ''Say, didn't we meet in the Stanford Prison Experiment?'' They consume what may or may not be alcohol. They are told what they are drinking, but sometimes they are told the truth and sometimes not. So really, nobody has a clue, except the bartender. Yes, the Barlab has a bartender. Once their blood alcohol is up to 0.04 -- half what many states allow for driving -- they watch a really short video, 25 seconds of the ''opaque gorilla'' original, and are told to count the number of times the white team passes the basketball back and forth to one another. Afterward, they are asked if they saw the gorilla. Only 18 percent of the people drinking alcohol noticed the gorilla, which is the point of the paper by Dr. Clifasefi and colleagues. But what caught my eye was that only 46 percent of the sober people saw the gorilla.
