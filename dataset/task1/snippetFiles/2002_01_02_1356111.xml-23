	In New York, many Latinos are drawn to Islam as a way of reaching back to what they consider their true culture, the world of Islamic Spain that existed for more than 700 years after the first Muslim conquests in the eighth century.
	The process is similar to how some blacks view the adoption of Islam as an invocation of their African roots, said Hisham Aidi, a political science graduate student at Columbia University. He has studied Latino Muslims as part of a university project examining Muslim communities in New York City.
	At the same time, there has been a movement among scholars of Islam in recent years to show the religion's influence on Spanish culture, Mr. Aidi said. ''These scholars are taking on these works of art and literature, considered unassailably Western, sacrosanctly Spanish, and showing how there's a strong Islamic influence, an Arab component, a Moorish component,'' he said.
	For many Hispanics, turning to Islam is also a way of countering feelings of being downtrodden. ''Islam historically has always started with slaves and moved up to kings,'' Mr. Aidi said. ''In New York, you find a similar phenomenon.
