	Dr. Rieger, who treated many artists who paid him in paintings, had his collection confiscated by prominent Nazi art collectors. He was deported by the Nazis and died in 1942 in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in what is today the Czech Republic. His wife, Berta, died in Auschwitz in 1944.
	The Riegers had one son, Robert, who fled Austria in 1938 with his wife and daughter. He is dead but his daughter, in her late 70's, lives in Philadelphia.
	The outcome of the case could have ramifications throughout the art world because paintings from the Rieger collection now hang in public and private collections in many countries, and those works' ownership may be contested, too.
	''It's not just this painting that this is about,'' Stephan Templ, an expert on art and property stolen by the Nazis from Jews in Austria, said in a telephone interview from Vienna. ''Rieger was the biggest collector of modern art in Austria between the wars, and many more drawings and paintings that belonged to Rieger are in collections in Austria.''
	Mr. Templ and a colleague, Tina Walzer, an art historian, were browsing the Internet on Wednesday evening when they discovered that ''Wayside Shrine'' was coming up for sale.
