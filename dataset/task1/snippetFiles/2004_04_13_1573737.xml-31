	''If you are only talking about moving a cursor up and down on the screen, you don't need to get into the brain to do that,'' said Dr. Miguel Nicolelis, professor of neurobiology at Duke.
	In contrast, Dr. Nicolelis said, the system he is developing will control a robot arm, making three-dimensional movements that will be too complex to do without a neural implant. Dr. Kennedy performed his experiments on people who could not talk and had virtually no other means of communicating.
	Mr. Surgenor of Cyberkinetics, however, said that having participants who could talk would speed development of the system.
	''We need the feedback of what they are imagining when it doesn't work and what they are imagining when it works,'' he said.
	Dr. Jon Mukand of the Sargent Rehabilitation Center in Warwick, R.I., who will be the principal investigator of the trial and will select the participants, said the system had been proved safe in tests on 18 monkeys.
	Infections were rare and treatable, Dr. Mukand said, and the incidence should be even lower in people, who understand the risk.
	Dr. Donoghue of Cyberkinetics said the prototypes for many medical devices, including pacemakers and cochlear implants, had involved wires coming out of the body.
