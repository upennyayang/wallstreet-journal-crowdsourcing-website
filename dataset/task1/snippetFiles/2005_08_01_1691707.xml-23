	He talks of retiring the fleet ''in an orderly way,'' making sure that America has continued access to the space station and can launch the huge modules built by Europe and Japan, all of which depend on the shuttle. But after constant troubles, the lesson about the shuttle is that there is nothing orderly about it.
	The vision NASA had when Dr. Griffin was a young engineer there -- that the shuttle would be a reliable dump truck to space, with missions launched every two weeks -- is long forgotten. Now the question is whether the shuttle has any missions left.
	''The basic fact is that there are no good choices before him,'' said John M. Logsdon, the director of the space policy institute at George Washington University and a member of the commission that studied the Columbia disaster. ''He is on record being very skeptical of the viabilityof the shuttle. Yet he is dependent on it.''
	Dr. Logsdon added that ''there has to be a cutoff point at some point in the future where it's not worth it.''
	Dr. Griffin has won early points in Washington for his openness about the shuttle's problems.
