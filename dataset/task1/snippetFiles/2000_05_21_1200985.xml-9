	But things may not be as satisfying for the birds. ''The owl of Minerva flies only at dusk'' -- Hegel's comment about civilizations flourishing as they move toward the brink of extinction -- has an eerie echo for bird-watchers. Just as nature was, in some sense, beginning for me, Bill McKibben was foretelling ''The End of Nature.'' The inexhaustible, self-renewing environment of our fantasies died with the Industrial Revolution, and unless we change our ways, he posited, rising temperatures, acid rain and a host of other ills will carry off what's left of the natural world. Bird-watching, alas, is not necessarily an indication of the health of the bird population. George Fenwick, president of the American Bird Conservancy, a small but important advocacy group, points to the fanaticism of British bird-watchers, well known in this country because so many show up at American birding spots. ''The best birders are there and everyone's obsessed with birds,'' he told me, and yet ''there's hardly a wood lot left -- everything's been developed and redeveloped. I'm glad the Brits are so interested, but I hope that's not our fate.''
