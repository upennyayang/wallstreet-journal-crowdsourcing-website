	At night, we slept while the Polaris cruised to the next island; we visited eight in all. Among my favorites were Bartolom√©, for its red cragginess and incongruous staircase to the summit; Santiago, where Darwin spent part of his crucial five weeks; and the extraordinary Genovesa, its harbor a collapsed volcanic crater into which the sea has poured, forming a bay partially ringed by cliffs. Then there was the cave at Punta Vicente Roca on Isabela, as beautiful a spot as I've ever seen, mysterious as Delphi, where we rode an ocean swell into the very mouth of the cave. In the interior of Santa Cruz we drove up to the green highlands, and the tortoise reserve at El Chato, where I decided that those ancient, stolid animals, heavy as boulders, were the ones I loved most -- until I saw their opposite alight on a nearby branch, a red splash of feathers in the greenery, the tiny vermilion flycatcher.
	One evening, we anchored off the coast of Floreana for a barbecue supper on the rear deck. There was a full moon, a dome of unfamiliar stars and not a single airplane.
