	He said he expected that more such allele differences between populations would come to light, as have differences in patterns of genetic disease. ''I do think this kind of study is a harbinger for what might become a rather controversial issue in human population research,'' Dr. Lahn said. But he said his data and other such findings ''do not necessarily lead to prejudice for or against any particular population.''
	A greater degree of concern was expressed by Francis S. Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute. Dr. Collins said that even if the alleles were indeed under selection, it was still far from clear why they had risen to high frequency, and that ''one should resist strongly the conclusion that it has to do with brain size, because the selection could be operating on any other not yet defined feature.'' He said he was worried about the way these papers will be interpreted.
	Sarah Tishkoff, a geneticist at the University of Maryland and a co-author of both studies, said the statistical signature of selection on the two genes was ''one of the strongest that I've seen.''
