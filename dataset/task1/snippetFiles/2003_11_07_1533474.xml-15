	Matt Jones threw three touchdown passes to lead Arkansas past visiting South Carolina, 28-6, last night. Arkansas (6-3, 3-3 Southeastern Conference) became eligible for a bowl game for the sixth straight season under Coach Houston Nutt. That tied a mark South Carolina Coach Lou Holtz set when he was coaching the team from 1977 to 1983. Ken Hatfield, the current Rice coach, equaled that record at Arkansas from 1984 to 1989.
	Jones did not start, but entered on the second series. He completed 11 of 14 passes for 148 yards, including touchdown passes to tight end Jason Peters and wide receivers Richard Smith and George Wilson.
