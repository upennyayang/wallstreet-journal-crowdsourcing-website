	Over the centuries, humanity has been so impressed by the splendor of the peacock's colors that this magnificent bird has variously been a symbol of divine beauty, endless love, paradise, purity, rebirth and God's omniscience.
	Now physicists in China have discovered the secret of the peacock's array of hues.
	In a study published this month in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers report that slight variations in the arrangement of keratin and melanin are responsible for the palette of colors found in the eye of a peacock's tail feather. (Keratin is the material also found in human fingernails; melanin is the substance that darkens human skin.)
	''It's an ingenious and simple way to diversify colors,'' said Dr. Jian Zi, a physicist at Fudan University in Shanghai and lead author on the paper.
	He began the study with colleagues after being struck by the sight of peacock feathers in a Chinese market. ''I study optics,'' Dr. Zi said. ''So when I looked at these peacock feathers against the sunshine, it was a fascinating experience. What can produce such diversified colors?''
	In peacocks, each feather has a central rigid stem lined on both sides by a row of smaller barbs.
