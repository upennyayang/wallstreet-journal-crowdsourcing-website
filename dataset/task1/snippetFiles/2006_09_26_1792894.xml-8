	Being prodigious grazers, sheep and cows can practically destroy a grassland unless they are controlled. But it's not just the vegetation that can be harmed. Studies have shown that bird populations can be affected when land is overgrazed.
	But most of these studies are simply correlative; that is, they show changes in grazing and declines in bird populations and link the two.
	Darren M. Evans of the National Environment Research Council of Britain and colleagues wanted to study the effects of grazing more directly on one bird species, the ground-nesting, insect-eating meadow pipit.
	They set up seven-acre grassland plots in Scotland and stocked them only with sheep (reflecting the situation in much of Britain, where sheep grazing has become dominant) or with sheep and cattle. Over three years, they counted the number of pipit breeding pairs in each plot.
	The study, published in Biology Letters, found that in the plot with mixed sheep and cattle at a low density (about five animals among the seven acres), the number of breeding pairs of pipits increased. In sheep-only plots the number of pairs decreased, whether the density was low or high.
