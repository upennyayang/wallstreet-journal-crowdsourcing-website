	The topics in these preceptorials range from a day on Ellis Island to the Psychology of Lying. One program on wine tasting was so well received that students lobbied -- in vain -- to have it turned into a full-fledged course.
	Now, for the first time in the 10-year history of the program, there are four seminars about New Jersey: Physics Day at Six Flags in Jackson Township; Edison's Legacy, a trip to the Edison Museum in West Orange; the junket to Caesar's Palace Casino in Atlantic City; and the trip to Ellis Island.
	Professor Wyner, who grew up in Maplewood, said he would like to see the number of courses based in New Jersey increased.
	''I grew up in Jersey and still spend a lot of time there with my family,'' he said. ''I think we need another seminar on Cape May and a number of other place I could name.''
	In speaking with some students, it appeared that they would follow their favorite faculty members to the ends of the earth to get some quality personalized time. With many classes brimming with more than 300 students, popular faculty members are as sought after as rock stars.
