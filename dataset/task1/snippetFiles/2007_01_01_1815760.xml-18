	In some ways, the willingness of so many to make multimillion-dollar investments to take on Google and other search companies represents a startling change. In the late 1990s, when Microsoft dominated the technology world, inventors and investors did everything they could to avoid competing with the software company. Yet many of today's search start-ups are putting themselves squarely in the path of the Google steamroller. Most explain that decision in similar ways. They say that Google's dominance today is different from Microsoft's in the late 90s when its operating system was a virtual monopoly and nearly impossible to break. In the Internet search industry, ''you earn your right to be in business every day, page view after page view, click after click,'' said Barney Pell, a founder and the chief executive of Powerset, whose search service is not yet available. They also say that the market for search simply is too large to resist. Google, which, according to Nielsen, handles about half of all Internet searches in the United States, is valued at an astonishing $141 billion. So, the reasoning goes, anyone who can grab even a small slice of the search market could be well rewarded.
