	''The speed of the common PC has increased to such a dramatic rate,'' Dr. Anderson said, ''that the high-end PC today is as fast as one of these Cray supercomputers was about 10 years ago.''
	The real rise of distributed computing can be traced to 1994, when Dr. Donald Becker and Dr. Thomas Sterling, working for the Center of Excellence in Space Data and Information Sciences at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, created a cluster computer from 16 processors networked together and dubbed it Beowulf.
	Dr. Becker recalled that the name had been chosen by Dr. Sterling for a number of reasons, including a line loosely translated from ''Beowulf,'' the epic Anglo-Saxon poem, that described the heroic Beowulf as having the strength of many.
	The Beowulf Project proved that an incredibly powerful computer could be created by harnessing together many smaller computers like Pentium II's running open-source software like Linux. The idea took off, and clusters began to spring up at academic institutions and NASA research centers.
	''We know there are thousands -- there might be as many as 10,000 clusters out there,'' Dr. Becker said.
