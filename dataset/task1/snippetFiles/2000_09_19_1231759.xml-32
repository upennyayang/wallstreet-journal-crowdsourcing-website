	The video I screen to that number is a montage of about 50 prominent female scientists from the 20th century. My hope is that the girls will find these terrific women inspirational. Q. Some of these ''terrific women'' have been less than thrilled with your performances at scientific venues, have they not? A. Well, I offered to sing for free for the Women In Physics conference and I sent them a tape of a performance as a sample. They later informed me that they didn't think that what I did was ''appropriate'' for one of their conferences. People should understand that I'm a performance artist doing creative works on science; I'm not a lap dancer. I'm a feminist. I have a policy where I won't appear at a conference if there aren't other women presenters. Sometimes I just want to shout, ''Hey, ladies, let's have a sense of humor with our revolution.'' Q. You say that you are the Mae West of physics. Do you think physics is sexy? A. It is the sexiest science. What can be more sexy than the creation of the universe?
