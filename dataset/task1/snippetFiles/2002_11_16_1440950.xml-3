	The painting, ''Wayside Shrine,'' a pocket-size oil that Schiele painted in 1907, was to have gone on sale on Nov. 27 at the Dorotheum, Vienna's leading auction house.
	The painting was seized at the request of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wein, the organization representing Vienna's Jewish population. It was acting on behalf of the heirs of Dr. Heinrich Rieger, a Jewish dentist in Vienna whose collection of more than 800 works by early-20th-century Austrian artists was among the world's largest.
	Dr. Rieger, who treated many artists who paid him in paintings, had his collection confiscated by prominent Nazi art collectors. He was deported by the Nazis and died in 1942 in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in what is today the Czech Republic. His wife, Berta, died in Auschwitz in 1944.
	The Riegers had one son, Robert, who fled Austria in 1938 with his wife and daughter. He is dead but his daughter, in her late 70's, lives in Philadelphia.
	The outcome of the case could have ramifications throughout the art world because paintings from the Rieger collection now hang in public and private collections in many countries, and those works' ownership may be contested, too.
