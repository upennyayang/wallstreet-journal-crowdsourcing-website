	The group put together a 43-page dossier, including the offending cartoons and three more shocking images that had been sent to Danish Muslims who had spoken out against the Jyllands-Posten cartoons.
	Mr. Akkari denied that the three other offending images had contributed to the violent reaction, saying the images, received in the mail by Muslims who had complained about the cartoons, were included to show the response that Muslims got when they spoke out in Denmark.
	In early December, the group's first delegation of Danish Muslims flew to Cairo, where they met with the grand mufti, Muhammad Sayid Tantawy, Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit and Amr Moussa, the head of the Arab League.
	''After that, there was a certain response,'' Mr. Akkari said, adding that the Cairo government and the Arab League both summoned the Danish ambassador to Egypt for talks.
	Mr. Akkari denies that the group had meant to misinform, but concedes that there were misunderstandings along the way.
	In Cairo, for example, the group also met with journalists from Egypt's media.
	Several newspapers then ran articles claiming that Denmark planned to issue a censored version of the Koran.
	Mr. Akkari went on that trip.
