	''Rieger parted with his collection under duress,'' Mr. Korte added, ''and from a U.S. legal perspective, they are stolen pictures, and we treat them as stolen property.''
	Mr. Korte helped represent the heirs of Lea Bondi, a Jewish gallery owner in Vienna whose paintings were also Aryanized. One of the works claimed by Bondi's heirs is ''Portrait of Wally,'' an oil painting by Schiele that was on loan for an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and was seized in 1997 just before it was to be returned to Austria.
	The Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, issued a grand jury subpoena, effectively preventing the painting from leaving the country.
	The subpoena was later invalidated by an order of the New York State Court of Appeals, which found that the painting came under the jurisdiction of the state's 1968 Arts and Cultural Affairs Law, which prevents the seizure of works of art by the state.
	But then the office of the United States Attorney in Manhattan brought its own case, asserting that the painting had been illegally imported in violation of the National Stolen Property Act.
