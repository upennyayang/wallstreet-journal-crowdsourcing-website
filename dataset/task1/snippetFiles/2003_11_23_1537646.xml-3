	We stared at a 1635 anonymous engraving of a poison ivy plant. At the time, wealthy Europeans were hooking up with intrepid explorers, who would send them rarities, be it squash seed or a carnivorous plant, to be used as a medium of exchange, a way of gaining access to dukes and kings, Mr. Andrews said. American novelties -- corn, squash, tobacco and beans -- were as valuable as gold.
	Among the treasures on display are a map drawn by the King George III's royal geographer and a diary kept by John Bartram, a Philadelphia Quaker who was hired to explore Florida between 1763 and 1765. The rivers were then so crowded with bellowing alligators that boats could hardly maneuver.
	The documentation of these first forays was published in Europe; Americans were too busy warring with the Indians and otherwise trying to survive to make books, Mr. Andrews said. But in the 1800's, that began to change. The exhibition reveals the evolution not only of American botany and horticulture, but also how the printing industry and the mass production of books democratized knowledge.
	Some of the other things I learned at the library were that the first botanists were doctors searching for cures.
