	Mr. Zander appears on several companies' wish lists, say executive recruiters, along with David R. Carlucci, general manager of I.B.M.'s operations in the Americas; John R. Joyce, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer; and Dan Warmenhoven, chief executive of Network Appliance Inc.
	These executives have battle scars, and several high-technology companies -- Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks, Sycamore Networks, Redback Networks, Alcatel and Corning Inc. -- have recently looked or are still looking for executives with a record of coping with slumping sales and a hostile stock market, executive search firms say.
	Only Lucent and Nortel have announced searches for new chief executives, and the other companies did not return telephone calls asking what roles they hoped to fill. Likewise, none of the executives returned calls.
	The list of seasoned managers with the right credentials is short, and everyone is pursuing the same few people.
	''Middle managers and vice presidents have been in a bull market for the last 10 years or so and have had plenty of resources, and they don't know the rough discipline that's sometimes required to do a turnaround,'' said John Whitney, a professor at Columbia Business School and a turnaround manager credited with helping restructure Pathmark Stores.
