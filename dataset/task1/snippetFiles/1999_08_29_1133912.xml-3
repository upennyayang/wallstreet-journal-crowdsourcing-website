	Called the New England Salt Marsh Breeding Bird Survey, it goes beyond counting birds. It will provide much-needed baseline information on the marsh habitat and set the stage for long-term monitoring by volunteers.
	''We're trying to get a regional fix on New England marshes. No one has ever done this kind of survey, all along the coast,'' said Ms. Pendergast, who lives in Chester and is coordinating the Connecticut part of the survey. She and Mr. Robbins of New Haven, who is her assistant, and a few volunteers are recording what they find in the way of birds, plants and general conditions at 157 points in 84 marshes, from Greenwich to Stonington.
	Since birds start the day early, the surveyors do, too.
	''I leave at 4 A.M.; I'm usually on a marsh by 5,'' said Ms. Pendergast. On this day, she and Mr. Robbins had already completed their work at another site before they made their way, just after 7:30 A.M., to the marshes in Westbrook.
	The two wear grubby shoes and lots of insect repellent. Sometimes they travel by kayak or canoe; mostly they slog through mud and jump over drainage ditches.
