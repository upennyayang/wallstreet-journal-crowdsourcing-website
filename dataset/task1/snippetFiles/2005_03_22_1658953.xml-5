	Alzheimer's is a progressive brain disorder that gradually destroys a person's memory and ability to learn, reason, make judgments, communicate and carry out normal activities of daily life.
	Two changes in the brain are characteristic: abnormal microscopic structures called amyloid plaques that accumulate outside brain cells and tangles of a protein called tau that form inside brain cells. Because these changes are now seen only in autopsies, coming up with early diagnoses and tests for the disorder is a major challenge.
	Early signs may include forgetting recently learned information, performing familiar tasks only with difficulty, misplacing things (putting shoes in the refrigerator, for example), fumbling for the right word for an ordinary object (like a toothbrush) and forgetting where you are or how you got there. Personalities can also change, and patients can become paranoid, suspicious, fearful or extremely confused. Some lose their judgment and suffer from mood swings or loss of initiative.
	Built for Durability
	The brain is a very forgiving organ. It has a very large reserve capacity and can withstand an extraordinary number of ''hits'' and bounce back from them. Witness how well some people recover from serious strokes and brain trauma.
