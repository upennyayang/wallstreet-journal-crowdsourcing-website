	Nor did he bring an I've-got-mine attitude with him to the Rangers.
	''He likes to come out early, when I have the kids out there, and do his work,'' said Bucky Dent, an old shortstop himself and the Rangers' infield coach. ''He likes to do a lot of early work. His work ethic has been very good.''
	In Seattle, Rodriguez was notorious for his diligence and extra work and attention to every detail. While teammates played computer games or cards on team flights, for example, he watched baseball videotapes.
	''This guy studies the game more than anybody I've seen,'' Jay Buhner, a Mariners outfielder, said. ''He studies his swing when he's on the airplane. He's got tapes of himself. We used to bust him all the time because he was always watching himself. When we got on the plane to go to another city, he had all his at-bats against the pitchers we'd be facing and he was figuring out what was going on. He's got little tendencies that guys do.''
	Why does Rodriguez consume himself with study? Why did he seek out Bowa that night in Anaheim, a coach on an opposing team?
