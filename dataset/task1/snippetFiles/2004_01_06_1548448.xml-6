	The researchers suggest that by loosening up the walls, the expansins make the wall's component parts more accessible to the glycanases. So the plant tissue is broken down faster and the parasite can enter sooner. Hydrogen's Hurdles All the talk of a future economy based on hydrogen fuel is well and good, but there are many technological hurdles to overcome, not the least of which is figuring out how to store all that explosive gas efficiently and safely. Liquefying hydrogen for storage is energy intensive because it must be cooled to about minus 425 degrees Fahrenheit. And since there is no practical way to keep a storage container that cold, boil-off is a problem. It can be kept at room temperature as a compressed gas, but much less hydrogen can be stored in a given volume this way. A new solution has been proposed by scientists at the University of Chicago and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. They suggest storing hydrogen molecules in tiny ice cages. Specifically, they write in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, hydrogen could be stored in a network of frozen water molecules that has a crystalline structure, known as a clathrate.
