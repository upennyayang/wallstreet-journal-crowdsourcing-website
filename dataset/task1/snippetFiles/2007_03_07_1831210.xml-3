	The companies that are building or dreaming up large projects argue that there are economies of scale to be gained.
	In the desert north of Tucson, Arizona Public Service, an electric utility, is using an array of mirrors to concentrate sunlight and heat mineral oil up to 550 degrees; the heat vaporizes a liquid hydrocarbon, which runs a generator to make electricity.
	But this is no rooftop operation. There are six rows of mirrors, each nearly a quarter-mile long, totaling nearly 100,000 square feet. The project produces one megawatt of power -- enough to run a hospital or a large shopping center -- but the company that installed it, now called Acciona Solar Power (formerly Solargenix), expects to open a 350-acre plant in Boulder City, Nev., soon, producing 64 megawatts with similar technology. And Arizona Public Service is one of about a half-dozen utilities that is considering a joint project to build a 250-megawatt plant based on the same technology.
	Such projects run counter to some ideas of how alternative energy should be developed.
	''If you go and put it in the desert and bring it back in, you lose 7 to 9 percent on the way,'' he said.
