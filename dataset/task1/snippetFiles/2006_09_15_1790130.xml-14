	''I knew he was a journalist, and I knew he had a business,'' Luhnow said. ''So I wasn't expecting him to stop.''
	A few weeks before the Cardinals acquired Mulder in December 2004, a negative report about Mulder appeared in ''Baseball Forecaster'' with the comment, ''Risk-averse drafters might want to spend their money elsewhere.''
	When the trade was completed, Shandler's followers questioned the integrity of his report, with some suggesting that he had given Mulder a poor evaluation in an effort to lower his trade value.
	''After a while it was like, 'Why am I spinning my wheels here? I don't know if they're taking my information into account when making their moves,' '' Shandler said about the Cardinals, who went 105-57 and won the National League pennant in 2004.
	Luhnow said Shandler's report on Mulder did not affect the Cardinals' decision making.
	''It wasn't something that was of concern or something that ruffled feathers,'' he said. ''It was him doing his job and being a journalist.''
	Mulder went 16-8 in his first season with the Cardinals, but his strikeout rate declined greatly.
