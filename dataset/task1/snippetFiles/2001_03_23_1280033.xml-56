	It also told generators that for the next several months, they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices. The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices.
	When the agency's own 60-day deadline for examining market data in January approached, however, it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination. Instead, staff members said, the agency scrambled to forge a last-minute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a time-consuming investigation.
	During this scramble, a senior staff member, Kevin Kelly, suggested focusing on bad hours instead of bad actors.
	''Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal 'misbehavior' by sellers ('bad actors') always seems to fail,'' his memorandum said. It said that the agency could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the most critical hours.
	The suggestion won the day. The commission decided to limit its order to the hours when California declared a Stage 3 emergency, when supplies are critically low.
