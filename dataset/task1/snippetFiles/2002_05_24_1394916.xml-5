	He did so after he and his brother Fritz began the process to seek restitution in 1950, a lawyer for Mrs. Principe said. A lawyer and former adviser to the Wertheim family, Arthur Lindgens, traveled to New York from Germany and paid Gunther and Fritz Wertheim $9,200 each for the rights to their shares, insisting that the Wertheim department stores were ruined and the company's properties in East Berlin had been seized by Communist authorities. Mr. Lindgens's estate is also being sued by Mrs. Principe and her nephew; the lawyer for the estate would not comment.
	Using those shares, Mr. Lindgens, who was chairman of the company, and other German owners of Wertheim then quickly merged it with its main competitor, Hertie, another Jewish retailer that had also been taken over under the Nazis. KarstadtQuelle bought the merged companies in 1994. The company says it had $15 billion in sales in 2001.
	The 1951 deal came to light just two years ago because of the dogged sleuthing of Mrs. Principe's lawyers and a German graduate student at the Free University in Berlin who chose the Wertheim family as her Ph.D. subject.
