	Obviously, proposals for deploying a missile defense system or for financing research that involves the destruction of human embryos do not stand or fall together. Everything depends on how well each of those arguments can be substantiated with specific evidence.
	Still, the parallels in the arguments suggest that something is being missed when the ethical debate about stem cell research is reduced to medical progress versus the religious beliefs of anti-abortionists, or simply as a sticky tactical problem in President Bush's courting of churchgoers. And a lot is also missed when the missile defense question is not framed as an ethical issue at all.
	One senses that a deeper conflict about faith is at work here -- specifically about the faith that modernity has so firmly placed in science, technology and even medicine to ''relieve the human estate,'' as Francis Bacon promised.
	There are those, for example, who see this faith robustly at work in the sudden news that, while Washington was debating whether to finance research that would destroy human embryos languishing in fertility clinics, one such clinic announced it was now creating human embryos for no other purpose than research.
