	Mr. Miller has declined to comment on his role at PG&amp;E or at the agency. His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PG&amp;E and his duties at the agency.
	Those duties brought Mr. Miller to California last August. With electricity prices there soaring, he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agency's San Francisco office.
	One executive, Gary Stern, director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison, wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators. He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts -- and whether they had manipulated the markets.
	But when Mr. Miller and his team approached 11 generators and marketers -- including his old employer -- a few weeks later, they did it their way. They asked eight questions, many of them imprecise, like: ''Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market.''
	This question, Mr. Stern said in a recent interview, ''was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day.''
	Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper.
