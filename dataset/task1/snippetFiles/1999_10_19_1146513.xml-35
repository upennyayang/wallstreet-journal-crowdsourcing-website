	''Whatever the Governor does through regulations, action still needs to be taken against law breakers, and that's what we're doing,'' Mr. Spitzer said.
	Next on Mr. Spitzer's agenda is General Electric, which is locked in a battle with the Federal Environmental Protection Agency over how to deal with the PCB's, polychlorinated biphenyls, left in the Hudson River by two of the company's factories.
	Mr. Spitzer said his lawyers were preparing to open a new legal front this fall against the company, perhaps using tactics similar to those used successfully in recent years against big tobacco companies.
	Earlier this year, Mr. Spitzer met with top executives and lawyers for General Electric, in a meeting that was the equivalent of the weighing-in sessions held by boxers before they enter the ring for a prizefight.
	The top lawyer for the company, Stephen D. Ramsey, a former Justice Department official, presented a firm, spirited defense of the company's actions, Mr. Spitzer said. But Mr. Spitzer said he was unfazed.
	''I like lawyers like Steve,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''They're aggressive and firm and fun to joust with.''
	That bout is expected to begin early next month.
