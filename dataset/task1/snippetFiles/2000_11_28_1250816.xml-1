	About six months ago, I also began wearing magnetic knee sleeves when I played tennis and sometimes for my daily three-mile walk. In addition to being a lot more comfortable than those Neoprene knee braces I used to wear, the magnetic sleeves seem to have done more to minimize my discomfort during knee-stressing activities.
	But is it the magnets or wishful thinking that is helping? Although magnets have been used for thousands of years for pain relief, neither I nor medical science can as yet be certain that the magnets are actually responsible for alleviating my symptoms or anyone else's symptoms.
	Of course, I and millions of others with nagging aches and pains would be delighted to find an alternative to analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications, all of which can have unpleasant, even serious, side effects.
	Spurred by testimonials from athletes like football's Dan Marino, tennis's Lindsay Davenport and golf's Jim Colbert and John Huston, Americans are spending more than $300 million a year on therapeutic magnets for pain relief. There are devices for neck pain, back pain, knee pain, wrist pain, headache and generalized aches and pains associated with arthritis and fibromyalgia.
