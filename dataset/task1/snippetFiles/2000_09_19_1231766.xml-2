	The finding is based on research involving a specific kind of fear memory in animals, but many experts predict that it may also hold true for other kinds of memories in humans. They also say that the discovery could lead to ways of altering or erasing people's memories.
	The research, carried out at the Center for Neural Science at New York University, was described in the Aug. 17 issue of the journal Nature. This is the first good neurobiological explanation of the way memories are updated, said Dr. Daniel Schacter, a Harvard psychology professor and a memory expert. ''It's a mistake to think that once you record a memory, it is forever fixed,'' he said.
	Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist who studies memory at the University of Washington in Seattle, said: ''This is very interesting research. We're on the brink of being able to figure out how you might accomplish something like memory engineering.''
	It may be possible to erase traumatic memories in people who are plagued by them, she said, and to better understand how false memories are implanted into people's minds when they are given suggestions that they want to believe.
