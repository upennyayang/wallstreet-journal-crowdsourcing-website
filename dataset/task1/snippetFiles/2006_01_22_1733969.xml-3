	Assyrian, an ornately complex language more commonly called Akkadian, originated in the land between the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers, in Mesopotamia, but in the second millennium B.C. served as a common means of communication throughout the Middle East. From about 2600 B.C. on, it was written in cuneiform, or wedge-shaped letters, impressed by stylus on wax or clay or incised in stone.
	Akkadian was the region's predominant tongue for more than 2,500 years, and the dictionary, more than a mere list of words, grew into an encyclopedia of the region's culture, including law, astronomy, poetry, religion and the history of science. Its first volume was published in 1956. It now includes 23 volumes, with two more at the printer and a final volume due later this year.
	Dr. Reiner had a hand in all the volumes, said Martha Roth of the institute, now the dictionary's editor in charge, because she continued to write, review and edit entries for them after her formal retirement.
	Dr. Reiner's knowledge of Babylonian history of science was legendary among scholars.
	She published ''A Linguistic Analysis of Akkadian'' in 1966 and a collection of essays on the poetry of Babylonia and Assyria in 1985.
