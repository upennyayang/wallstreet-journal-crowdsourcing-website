	The outcome of the case could have ramifications throughout the art world because paintings from the Rieger collection now hang in public and private collections in many countries, and those works' ownership may be contested, too. ''It's not just this painting that this is about,'' Stephan Templ, an expert on art and property stolen by the Nazis from Jews in Austria, said in a telephone interview from Vienna. ''Rieger was the biggest collector of modern art in Austria between the wars, and many more drawings and paintings that belonged to Rieger are in collections in Austria.'' Mr. Templ and a colleague, Tina Walzer, an art historian, were browsing the Internet on Wednesday evening when they discovered that ''Wayside Shrine'' was coming up for sale. The painting went from Dr. Rieger's collection directly into the hands of Friedrich Welz, a prominent Nazi-era gallery owner who Aryanized most of the Rieger collection, according to ''Our Vienna: Aryanization in Austria,'' a book Mr. Templ and Ms. Walzer published last year in Germany. ''If there is now a legal possibility to seize Aryanized property, it would really change the situation in art restitution,'' Ms. Walzer said.
