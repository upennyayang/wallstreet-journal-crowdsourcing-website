	The timing of the fateful split has been determined by molecular biological research, and in recent years fossil hunters have found traces of what those earliest hominids, human ancestors and their close relatives, might have been like.
	When the first fossil bones and teeth of this hominid were described three years ago, paleoanthropologists tentatively identified it as a more apelike subspecies that they named Ardipithecus ramidus kadabba. The original ramidus species was found in 1994 in 4.4-million-year-old sediments, also in Ethiopia.
	But with more discoveries and a closer study, especially of the teeth, the scientists decided that the kadabba fossils from five individuals were distinctive enough to qualify as a separate species, Ardipithecus kadabba. In that case, the scientists added, kadabba was not a subspecies, but the likely direct ancestor of ramidus. But there were too few skeletal bones yet to learn much about other aspects of kadabba.
	The description and interpretation of the new hominid species appear today in the journal Science. The authors of the report are Dr. Yohannes Haile-Selassie of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, Dr. Gen Suwa of the University of Tokyo and Dr. Tim D. White of the University of California, Berkeley.
