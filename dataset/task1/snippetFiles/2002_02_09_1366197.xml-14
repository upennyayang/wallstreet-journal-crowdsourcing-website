	Ms. Kaufman of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation attended the news conference with Dr. Slade. ''Outside of the day that I married my wife,'' Ms. Kaufman quoted Dr. Slade as saying, ''this is the most incredible thing that has ever happened to me, because it culminates all the work I put in.''
	The same day, the tobacco industry sued to block the F.D.A. from regulating the sale and promotion of cigarettes. In March 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the agency had not received authority from Congress to regulate tobacco products.
	Dr. Slade, whose license plates read ''NO CIGS,'' was a member of the team that conducted the first scholarly analysis of tobacco company documents, which formed the basis for the film ''The Insider.'' His analysis led to a series of articles in The Journal of the American Medical Association and the book ''The Cigarette Papers'' (1996), an edited compendium of the documents with commentary.
	John Downey Slade was born in Atlanta on Feb. 19, 1949. He graduated from Oberlin College and from the Emory School of Medicine. In 1998, he was appointed professor of medicine at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.
