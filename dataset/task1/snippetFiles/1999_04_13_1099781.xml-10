	Because taste and smell are so closely linked, it is sometimes difficult to tell which system is in trouble. Patients who suffer from anosmia, or a loss of smell, for example, often report to clinics complaining instead that they have lost their sense of taste. But taste and smell phantoms, Dr. Bartoshuk said, usually can be distinguished by their quality. Bitter, salty, sweet, or sour phantoms -- corresponding to four basic categories the tongue can distinguish -- are always related to disorders of taste. Smell phantoms, in contrast, are usually more complex in nature: patients may complain of tasting or smelling rotting food, for example, fecal matter, gasoline or smoke.
	Like Dr. Fowler, some patients who have taste phantoms also suffer from ''burning mouth syndrome,'' an intense burning sensation on the tongue, often at its tip. When Dr. Bartoshuk examined Dr. Fowler, she discovered that he was a ''supertaster,'' someone who has an unusually large density of taste buds, each surrounded by pain fibers. Supertasters, Dr. Bartoshuk has found, are more likely to develop burning mouth syndrome, as are post-menopausal women, who often have lost their ability to sense bitter tastes.
