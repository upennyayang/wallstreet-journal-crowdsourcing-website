	The project has raised and spent $3 million to date for restoration and stabilization work, and an almost equal amount for educational and cultural programs, said Amy E. Waterman, the executive director. It hopes to raise $8 million more, to complete the restoration and establish an endowment. At Central Synagogue, paradoxically, it was an earlier renovation project that cost its roof. The fire was apparently started by a worker's blowtorch during the installation of an air-conditioning system in the rooftop. For ''about a minute'' after the fire, there was thought of razing the gutted building at Lexington Avenue and 55th Street and starting anew, said the senior rabbi, Peter J. Rubinstein. That was quickly replaced by a resolve not just to rebuild but to alter the building to meet contemporary needs. ''We had already been wrestling with issues of space, sound, lighting and configuration,'' Rabbi Rubinstein said. ''Although we would not have chosen the means by which this was done, there are very few times in American religious history that a congregation has the opportunity to retrofit a cathedral-type building. As awful as it was, the fire gave us this opportunity.''
