	MR. JOUSSE certainly does not have the look of a senior City Hall bureaucrat. He keeps his gray and yellow beard long and bushy. He does not remember the last time he wore a tie. He prefers to drink a dark French beer with his workers than to sip fine wine at City Hall soirees.
	Tooling around town in a small, white Renault sedan with a special plate in the windshield, he parks wherever he wants -- even on the cobblestone walkway at Notre-Dame and on the quay in front of the Musée d'Orsay.
	He rattles off details about lighting history: how the adorning of Paris in light began in the 14th century when Philip V the Tall ordered candles to be lighted in three sites every night, how the Paris lamppost was invented in the 18th century, how one way Paris earned the nickname City of Light was from the artificial electrical light displays at the Paris Fair of 1900.
	He recalls the time a few years back when he and a team were experimenting with light on Sacré Coeur Basilica in Montmartre and colored it mauve.
