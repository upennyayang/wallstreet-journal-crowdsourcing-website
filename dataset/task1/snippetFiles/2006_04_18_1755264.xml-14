	''Do not wash aquarium accessories in the kitchen sink, bathroom sink or bathtub,'' another item on the list advises.
	''If you have no other option,'' it continues, ''then thoroughly clean and disinfect all the surfaces used with a bleach solution of four tablespoons per liter of lukewarm water. Rinse these surfaces well before reusing.''
	Though the particular drug-resistant strain identified in Australia has yet to be reported from American aquariums, Dr. Fred Angulo of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that taking the sorts of precautions that Dr. Lightfoot and Dr. Gaulin recommended made good sense.
	All three researchers agreed that beyond any immediate public health risk, a potentially bigger problem is the makeup of the strain of Salmonella paratyphi B making the rounds in Australian fish tanks.
	The strain was loaded with five different genes that enable any bacteria carrying them to be impervious to at least as many different antibiotics.
	There are still effective drugs that, if needed, will readily kill the strain, and it shows no signs of spreading to the human food supply or through it.
	But where is such multipronged drug resistance likely to have developed?
