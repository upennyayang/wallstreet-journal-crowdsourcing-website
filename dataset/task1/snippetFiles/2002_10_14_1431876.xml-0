	The front door to the office of Slashdot bears a nerdy little joke. A computer key is glued to the door: ''Enter.'' The other side of the door has an old ''Return'' key.
	That's the geeky essence of Slashdot.org, an online publication with a fanatical community of millions of readers that combines a rich view of technology with quick, off-kilter wit.
	Could it be that this is the 21st-century model for Internet publishing?
	The highest-flying print publications of the dot-com bubble burbled about technology and the businesses that it fertilized. But now they and their glossy paper have fallen to earth. Just last week, Forbes ASAP and Upside joined the once-fat Industry Standard in the glossies' graveyard. ''There is no market for a dedicated new-economy publication,'' said Monie Begley, a spokeswoman for Forbes.
	But far away from the buzz and the glamour, Slashdot survives and thrives. Run out of a basement office in a suburb of Ann Arbor, Mich., Slashdot has remained true to the slogan: ''News for nerds. Stuff that matters.''
	The secret to the online publication's moderate success? ''They didn't buy a Super Bowl ad,'' joked Sean Bergeron, a fan from Virginia.
