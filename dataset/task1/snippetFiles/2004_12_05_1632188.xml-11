	Wiggle, Wriggle
	The Wall Street Journal editorialized that Iran is using its dialogue with Europe to win ''diplomatic wriggle room'' to develop a nuclear bomb.
	This triggers the wiggle-wriggle controversy. To wiggle is to move from side to side, or to and fro; from this we get wiggle room, defined in this space 20 years ago as ''an implicit opportunity for later flexibility . . . not quite an 'escape hatch' or a 'way out.'''
	For these two decades, wiggle room has been continually challenged by wriggle room, which has the advantage of alliteration. However, wriggle (from Old English wrigian, root of awry) means ''to squirm, writhe, move sinuously,'' as distinct from wiggle, which denotes back-and-forth motion, not necessarily twisting.
	I'm not knocking wriggle, which -- when followed by out in diplomatic parlance -- vividly calls up the picture of sneaky evasion by artifice. But when paired with room, wriggle has not succeeded in dislodging the more limited, precise and less pejorative wiggle. Although there is a joyous kindergarten quality to wriggle room, wiggle room predominates in current usage by more than 14 to 1.
