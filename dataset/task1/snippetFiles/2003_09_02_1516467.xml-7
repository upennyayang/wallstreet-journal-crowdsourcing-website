	Mr. Bush promised last week in a speech in St. Louis to ''work with the Congress to make sure we provide the resources to do the work of freedom and security'' in Iraq. But his spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, said an emergency spending request would not be submitted to Congress until the administration had ''a full and complete understanding'' of the costs. The start of September is always a sort of new beginning in Washington. Mr. Bush has spent the month of August at his ranch near Crawford, Tex. Members of Congress have been scattered around the country, hearing concerns of constituents, or they have taken overseas trips. Now, as they return to the Capitol -- the Senate on Tuesday and the House on Wednesday -- lawmakers will have a chance to report back on what they have learned. The Northeast and Midwest blackout, for instance, is certain to become a major topic of discussion as the House and Senate try to reconcile their differing versions of an energy bill. The most contentious issue is drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. The House bill would permit it, while the Senate version -- a Democratic bill that Republicans have already vowed to rip up in conference between the chambers -- would not.
