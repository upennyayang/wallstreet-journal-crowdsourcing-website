	According to the lawsuit, employees are rated on a five-point scale, with only a certain percentage permitted to receive each score. Employees doing the same job in the same unit are also given a ''stack ranking,'' from most to least valuable. Managers decide those rankings largely using what are called ''lifeboat discussions,'' where they choose which employees they would want with them if stuck in a lifeboat. Managers had no other clear criteria, according to Christine Webber, a lawyer at Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &amp; Toll who is representing the employees. Grading is highly subjective at Microsoft, according to Peter M. Browne, a former executive who is also suing the company, charging discrimination. Mr. Browne, who is black, said managers were forced to use a curve in evaluating even small groups. He said he had to rate a group of five on a curve, for example, in deciding which ones would not receive stock options. ''You weren't told anything -- just meet the curve,'' Mr. Browne said. He says managers ended up favoring people with whom they socialized. ''People gravitate to people who are like them, and the system just forces that,'' he said.
