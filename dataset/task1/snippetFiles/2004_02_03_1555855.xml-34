	Other research, however, has shown that there is some effect of greater oxygen concentration on the size of an organism. Studies of marine invertebrates, for example, have found a correlation between larger species and colder, more oxygen-rich waters: the more oxygen in the water, essentially, the bigger the creatures get.
	Dr. Dudley and others have conducted experiments raising fruit flies and other insects in oxygen-rich environments. Some have shown size increases; others have not.
	Dr. Dudley has focused on pressure because, in addition to having a higher concentration of oxygen, the Carboniferous atmosphere would have had much more of the gas. ''Plants were pumping oxygen into the atmosphere,'' he said. The amount of nitrogen would have been undiminished, so overall pressure would have risen.
	Though the results have yet to be published, his experiments with fruit flies raised under elevated pressures show a 20 percent increase in body mass over five generations.
	But why would more oxygen make for bigger insects?
	One idea, Dr. Harrison said, is that oxygen may be a trigger for molting. Before they shed their skin, Dr. Harrison said, invertebrates generally double their weight.
	Or it may not.
