	Joseph Bowring, who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the mid-Atlantic transmission system, said that power companies there had exercised some market power. But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, not local regulators, had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not, he said.
	Mr. Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so. In the end, Mr. Bowring and several agency officials said, the agency chose not to investigate.
	The decision roiled some agency officials.
	Ron Rattey, a veteran agency economist, wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as ''impotent in our ability to monitor, foster, and ensure competitive electric power markets.'' The staff, the memorandum said, did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make. Such data would have been useful to Mr. Bowring.
	Local-Federal Clash
	Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own. Monitors in New England have intervened about 600 times since 1999 to correct prices they determined had been caused, at least in part, by market manipulation.
