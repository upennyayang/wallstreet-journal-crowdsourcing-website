	Dr. Barnard said: ''I grew up in North Dakota where my father had a cattle operation; my grandfather was a cattle rancher all his life. My uncle and cousins are in that business, and they're all decent, good folks. Having said that, if you eat that product, as I did during my formative years, you're getting a degree of saturated fat and cholesterol that the rest of the world does not eat. If my family was working in a rice paddy instead of a feedlot, we would have been a healthier lot.''

	''If you want to be a vegetarian or a vegan whatever, God bless you, it's your choice,'' he said. ''But when this so-called doctor's group comes out and says if you don't make the same choice I do, then you are putting your family's health at risk when there is no medical consensus about that, I object. I have nothing against vegetarians or vegans. I just wouldn't want to go out to dinner with one.''
