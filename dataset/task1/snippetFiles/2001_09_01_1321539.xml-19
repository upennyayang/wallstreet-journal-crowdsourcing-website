	Other scholars disagreed. ''Kertzer's taken the worst examples said and done in the name of the church and argued that they were central to the teachings of the Catholic Church,'' said Ronald Rychlak, the associate dean of the University of Mississippi law school and the author of ''Hitler, the War and the Pope'' (Genesis Press), a sympathetic portrait of Pope Pius XII. ''There were anti-Semitic articles and editorials, but he discounts popes' distancing themselves from that.''
	Indeed, where others have portrayed his predecessor, Pope Pius XI, as a courageous defender of Jews -- one who tearfully told an audience of Belgian pilgrims in 1938: ''Anti-Semitism is inadmissible. We are all spiritually Semites'' -- Mr. Kertzer depicts him as a pontiff whose moral outrage was tempered by his allegiance to traditional church culture, where villification of Jews was routine.
	In Mr. Kertzer's view, the famous hidden encyclical against anti-Semitism commissioned by Pius XI shortly before his death in 1939 included anti-Jewish stereotypes and was ''less than a ringing condemnation.'' (The encyclical was never published: Pius XI died without releasing it, and his successor, Pope Pius XII, who maintained diplomatic ties with Hitler, did not pursue it.)
