	The pre-suburbanized, pre-television-dominated, pre-automobile-oriented New York of 1956 was the nation's ''leading manufacturing city,'' said Dr. Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University, editor of the Encyclopedia of New York City. A premier port city in the pre-container era, New York was where the great liners still docked and the great trains still roared into the terminals.
	Employment was characterized ''by the white male union blue-collar worker,'' said Dr. Mike Wallace, a professor of history at John Jay College and co-author of ''Gotham: A History of New York to 1898,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize for history in 1999. ''Now the labor centerpiece involves white-collar, female, nonunion people of color.''
	During the last Subway Series, New York was a town where neighborhoods, parishes and ethnic communities were much more the center of life. The city's relationship with its baseball gods was also more intimate.
	''The connection between players and fans was more personal and exciting,'' given the localized nature of New York in 1956, said Doris Kearns Goodwin, the historian and political scientist, who was 13 when she avidly followed the last Subway Series.
