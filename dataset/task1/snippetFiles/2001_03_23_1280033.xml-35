	The industry, not surprisingly, shares that view. One vocal critic was Mr. Miller. Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets, he was director of policy coordination for the national energy-trading unit of PG&amp;E Corporation, the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric, the California utility. Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during California's crisis, Mr. Miller's former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide. PG&amp;E Energy Trading, by several estimates, is now the second-largest seller of electricity in New England. The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators. They intervened several times in 1999 and 2000 to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PG&amp;E and other companies. Mr. Miller denounced the practice, though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged ''very high'' prices when it could. ''One person's predatory pricing is another person's competitive advantage,'' Mr. Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in 1999. New England regulators too often acted as ''judge, jury and executioner'' when overseeing the market, he said.
