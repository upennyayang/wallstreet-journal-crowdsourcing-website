	Vasimr avoids the melting engine problem by containing and guiding the gases with magnetic fields.
	The engine works by injecting the hydrogen fuel into a chamber where it is bombarded by radio waves. ''Like a microwave oven,'' Dr. Chang-Diaz said. The radio waves heat the gas and strip away electrons from the hydrogen atoms, creating a gas of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.
	The resulting charged particles spiral around in a magnetic field as radio waves further heat them until they escape out the back of the engine at speeds of up to 650,000 m.p.h., or about 60 times as fast as the exhaust from the chemical rockets.
	By altering the magnetic fields, the engine's nozzle can be opened up for more thrust as the spaceship enters or leaves orbit and can be throttled back for better fuel efficiency during the trip. Chemical rockets, in contrast, fire much more powerful bursts, but they can only be sustained for minutes. The continuous firing of the plasma engine would cut the astronauts' Earth-to-Mars trip from six months to three months, reducing the astronauts' exposure to damaging cosmic radiation and calcium-draining weightlessness.
