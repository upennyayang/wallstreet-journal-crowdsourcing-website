	Dr. Schiffer speculates that in certain mental disorders, one hemisphere is less mature than the other. The immature side is the repository of past traumas and can come to dominate the healthy side. Thus each hemisphere has mental properties with some autonomy from the other side. Each can hold separate opinions, have a different sense of human and carry a different perspective on the world.
	Many people feel no mood difference when wearing the goggles, Dr. Schiffer said. This may be because both their hemispheres have similar outlooks, being equally calm or equally troubled.
	Dr. Schiffer uses the goggles in therapy sessions to help patients recognize their two minds and to help the mature side take control over the immature side. Patients wearing goggles can actually converse with the opposite hemisphere, he said, and through talk therapy work toward recovery. The goggles do not support the idea that the right brain is poetic and the left is logical, Dr. Schiffer said. People are very different. Each hemisphere is individualistic; either one can be messed up or both sides can be in balance.
	Dr. Pettigrew, who invented the sticky-switch idea of depression, also falls into the two-minds camp.
