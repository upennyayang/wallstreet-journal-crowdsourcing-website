	He shrieked when he saw for the first time that the Grand Palais, which belongs to the state, not the city, had been lighted up in bright blue-green. He stopped the car, pulled a camera and tripod out of the trunk and started taking pictures. ''I hope it's only for Christmas!'' he said. ''It's so Las Vegas!''
	By contrast, he shows off the lighting of the Petit Palais, which belongs to Paris, just across the street. Its spotlights have been hidden in the tops of the streetlamps. He attracted pedestrians to the ominously dark sidewalk along the Boulevard de Bercy under the A4 highway, lighting it in bright blue.
	Mr. Jousse's goal is to steep the city's structures in history and integrate them into their surroundings rather than to treat them as individual jewels that should be showcased.
	''The secrets are very simple,'' he said. ''Blend light with the surroundings. Don't annoy the birds, the insects, the neighbors or the astronomers. If City Hall gave me money to do whatever I want, I'd teach people about the beauty of light. I'd make Parisians the owners of their light.''
