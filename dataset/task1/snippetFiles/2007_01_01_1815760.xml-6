	''There is way too much obsession with search, as if it were the end of the world,'' said Esther Dyson, a well-known technology investor and forecaster. ''Google equals money equals search equals search advertising; it all gets combined as if this is the last great business model.''
	It may not be the last great business model, but Google has proved that search linked to advertising is a very large and lucrative business, and everyone -- including Ms. Dyson, who invested a small sum in Powerset -- seems to want a piece of it.
	Since the beginning of 2004, venture capitalists have put nearly $350 million into no fewer than 79 start-ups that had something to do with Internet search, according to the National Venture Capital Association, an industry group.
	An overwhelming majority are not trying to take Google head on, but rather are focusing on specialized slices of the search world, like searching for videos, blog postings or medical information. Since Google's stated mission is to organize all of the world's information, they may still find themselves in the search giant's cross hairs. That is not necessarily bad, as being acquired by Google could be a financial bonanza for some of these entrepreneurs and investors.
