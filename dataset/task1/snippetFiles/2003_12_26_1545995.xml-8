	The monitoring system was a result of the 1996 Cattle Passports Order, which requires every head of cattle to have identifying papers from the age of 28 days, and permission from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for any movement or sale.
	This tracing system, now computerized, has spawned some odd cottage industries here. H. J. Jones and Sons in Shropshire, for example, supplies ''quick easy cattle passport applications,'' according to advertisements, and can forward farmers' cellphone text messages about their herd's movements into the government tracking system.
	Inspections and handling requirements changed, too. In 1995, Britain centralized responsibility for meat inspections from 300 local district councils to the newly created Meat Hygiene Service. From its York headquarters, the agency would put the ''highest priority'' on enforcing measures to ''deal with B.S.E.,'' it said then. In 1996, it nearly doubled the number of full time inspectors and developed a new grade of ''meat technician,'' whose job was solely to ensure that slaughterhouses and butchers were conforming with rules intended to limit the disease. Names of any businesses with violations are made public.
	The prevention and regulatory measures helped to revive the industry.
