	But what seems clear from trips to several ballparks last week is that widespread confusion and even denial persist about steroid use in what are still the infant stages of Major League Baseball's screening program.
	Asked if he thought steroids were a significant problem among pitchers, Terry Francona, manager of the Boston Red Sox, said, ''I don't feel comfortable giving an opinion on something where my opinion is going to be somewhat ignorant.''
	Compared with officials in Olympic sports like track and field, which has been testing for steroids since the late 1960's, many in baseball seem far behind the learning curve.
	''I've never seen or heard of a pitcher that wanted to do that because it would add bulk, and that's the worst thing you can do as a pitcher,'' Ray Miller of the Baltimore Orioles, one of the game's most highly respected pitching coaches, said of steroids.
	Others, in and out of baseball, disagree.
	Dr. Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor and steroids expert who testified before Congress in March, said in an interview that ''given the competition to keep their jobs and the money involved, I can't believe that a significant percent of pitchers haven't tried this.''
