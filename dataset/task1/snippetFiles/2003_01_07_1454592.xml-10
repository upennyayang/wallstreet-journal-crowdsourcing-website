	The newfound planet has been named OGLE-TR-56b. The faint star it orbits had been identified as one of 59 candidates for the search, performed by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, or OGLE, which monitors thousands of objects. The transit, or TR, was successful on the 56th of these stars. The ''b'' denotes a companion of the star.
	The detection did not come easily. Many of the companions turned out to be faint stellar-mass objects, not planets. ''Our success depended on efficiently eliminating binary stars using smaller telescopes,'' said Dr. Maciej Konacki of the California Institute of Technology, a team member.
	Confirmation of the new planet was made in several nights of study at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. This revealed the wobbling effect on the star by the planet's gravity.
	Measurements of that wobble showed that the planet's mass is only slightly less than Jupiter's. The magnitude of the dimming of light at transit indicated that the planet's diameter is about 2.6 times that of Jupiter, which means that the object is a low-density gas giant.
	TR-56b is closer to its star than any other known planet.
