	For two decades, Vince Vincenzo has followed and rooted for the Nets, with no time off for good behavior.
	During most of those years, Mr. Vincenzo simply cheered in the shadows of others. But last week, as the once forlorn New Jersey Nets began play in the team's first National Basketball Association finals, he stepped out into the bright lights of June basketball.
	''Being a Nets fan, you're always waiting for the other shoe to drop,'' said Mr. Vincenzo, 34, an accountant from New Hyde Park, on Long Island. ''There were days that it was tough to be a fan, but you sort of stick with it and hope good things happen, and this year they have.''
	For season after season, a small, hardy, sometimes masochistic group of fans from around the region has suffered a miserable litany of errant jump shots, blown halftime leads and horrendous front-office decisions. (Two phrases, forever linked, come to mind: Julius Erving and former Net.) This year, they have been joined by more than a few bandwagon jumpers, claiming, even as they tear the price tags off their newly purchased Jason Kidd jerseys, that they have been following the team all along, really.
