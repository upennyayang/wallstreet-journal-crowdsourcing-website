	BY the late 1800's, salesmen were crisscrossing the country with colorful plant cards, including cigar-smoking carrots. Farmers held on to the cards, waiting until spring for delivery of their orders. Mail-order nurseries outdid one another's claims. In 1906 H.W. Buckbee of Rockford, Ill., created a cover girl by topping a Buckbee Extra Early Large New Queen Cabbage with a gold crown and cross.
	There were little books for children, who were encouraged to learn the Latin names of flowers and insects. And as mass production drove down their cost, how-to books appeared on almost every aspect of gardening, from pruning to beekeeping.
	The sight of these texts made me long to reach into the glass cabinets and turn the pages -- to read firsthand, for example, what Bartram wrote when he was navigating a river thick with bellowing alligators.
	Eventually, I will able to do just that. Mr. Andrews has given his vast collection to the Botanical Garden library. Some of his books are already in the rare book room. When the exhibition ends in February, others will move there, too. They can't be checked out and the pages can't be copied, but you can sit and read all day, if you like.
