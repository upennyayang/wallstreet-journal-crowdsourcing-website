	Real-time information from the body, the space around the body and the subjective feelings from the body are also represented in multisensory regions, Dr. Blanke said. And if these regions are directly simulated by an electric current, as in the cases of the two women he studied, the integrity of the sense of body can be altered. As an example, Dr. Blanke described the case of a 22-year-old student who had electrodes implanted into the left side of her brain in 2004. ''We were checking language areas,'' Dr. Blanke said, when the woman turned her head to the right. That made no sense, he said, because the electrode was nowhere near areas involved in the control of movement. Instead, the current was stimulating a multisensory area called the angular gyrus. Dr. Blanke applied the current again. Again, the woman turned her head to the right. ''Why are you doing this?'' he asked. The woman replied that she had a weird sensation that another person was lying beneath her on the bed. The figure, she said, felt like a ''shadow'' that did not speak or move; it was young, more like a man than a woman, and it wanted to interfere with her.
