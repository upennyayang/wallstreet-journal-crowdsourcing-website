	Ms. Flores was one of a dozen parents brought to the hearing by leaders of the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, an umbrella organization of neighborhood groups that has been harshly critical of bilingual education.
	But like the other parents who spoke yesterday, many of them describing in emotional detail how the system had failed their children, Ms. Flores testified that current classes for limited English learners, however flawed, could be improved with more money, better qualified teachers and principals who are willing to explain the various options to parents.
	Mr. Unz, who spent $800,000 of his own money on a ballot initiative to defeat bilingual education in California, has told the leaders of the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation on several occasions that he would be willing to support -- and perhaps bankroll -- an effort to repeal bilingual education in New York. But his overtures have yet to be accepted.
	In taking up the issue of bilingual education, the task force and a separate subcommittee of the Board of Education are studying introductory English programs whose definitions are fluid, and whose ratio of English to foreign language varies greatly, depending on the school, classroom and teacher involved.
