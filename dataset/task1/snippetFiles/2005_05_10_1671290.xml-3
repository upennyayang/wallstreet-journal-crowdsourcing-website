	In the recent book ''Not by Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution,'' Dr. Boyd and his co-author, an environmental scientist, explained why culture was ''essential to human adaptation, as much a part of human biology as bipedal locomotion.''
	Q. Your book is called ''Not by Genes Alone.'' Why that title?
	A. We wanted to call it ''The Nature of Culture,'' but our publishers, wouldn't have it. They didn't want us stuck on the social science shelves at the bookstore, where books generally don't do well.
	The book is a synthesis of current thinking on the role culture plays in human evolution. My co-author, Peter Richerson, and I believe that when discussing the traits that have helped humans become such a successful species, we should avoid that old nature-versus-nurture debate.
	That's the view that behavior is either learned or genetic. Instead, we need to be talking about genes and culture, and how they interact with each other.
	Most people think that culture is free from the shackles of biology because it is learned. That's wrong. Learned behavior is shaped by psychological mechanisms that have evolved, just like any other trait.
