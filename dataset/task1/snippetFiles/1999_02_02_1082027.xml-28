	In 2000 and 2002, the craft will gather dust in the regions between Mars and Jupiter. Recently, other probes moving through these areas have found a strong flow of particles from roughly the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, toward which the Sun is moving.
	In January 2004, Stardust is to encounter Wild-2 -- a glob of dirty ice a few miles wide. It is considered an ideal target because it only recently has been deflected by Jupiter's gravity from a distant orbit into the inner solar system, so its outer layers have undergone relatively little solar heating.
	Wild-2 now travels in a looping path from just outside Jupiter's orbit to just inside that of Mars, where it makes its closest approach to the Sun and reaches peak activity.
	The spacecraft, 97 days after that peak, is to zoom past the comet. The rendezvous site lies beyond the red planet. Still, the Sun will be able to coax the ice ball into shedding dense swarms of particles and vapors.
	At 13,600 miles per hour, the spacecraft is to swoop through the comet's coma, the globular cloudlike mass that makes up the head, passing within 100 or so miles of the core.
