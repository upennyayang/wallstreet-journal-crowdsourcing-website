	Power rates in the hours between midnight and 5 a.m. routinely range from 44 to 64 percent lower than in the hours between noon and 5 p.m., said Chris Olert, a spokesman for Con Ed. On a very hot summer day, with demand for power approaching the utility's transmission capacity, the difference could be as much as 94 percent, he said.
	Just turning on a chiller unit can be an expensive proposition for a landlord, said Daniel F. Tangel, one of the owners of Tangel Associates, a consulting engineering firm in Bohemia on Long Island and a consultant to the Durst project.
	''Say you have a warm day in March -- most leases only require landlords to provide cooling for April or May to October -- and the building manager wants to start a chiller,'' he said. ''If it is a 500-kilowatt chiller and the rate is $30 a kilowatt, that is $15,000 just to turn it on.''
	And because Con Ed has separate charges for maintaining the capacity to deliver power to commercial users as well as a consumption charge for the electricity actually used, a brief spike in demand can result in a sharply higher capacity bill for an entire month, he said.
