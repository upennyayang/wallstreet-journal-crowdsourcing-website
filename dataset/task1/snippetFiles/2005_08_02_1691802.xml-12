	Although people may think of their body as a fairly permanent structure, most of it is in a state of constant flux as old cells are discarded and new ones generated in their place. Each kind of tissue has its own turnover time, depending in part on the workload endured by its cells. The cells lining the stomach, as mentioned, last only five days. The red blood cells, bruised and battered after traveling nearly 1,000 miles through the maze of the body's circulatory system, last only 120 days or so on average before being dispatched to their graveyard in the spleen.
	The epidermis, or surface layer of the skin, is recycled every two weeks or so. The reason for the quick replacement is that ''This is the body's saran wrap, and it can be easily damaged by scratching, solvents, wear and tear,'' says Elaine Fuchs, an expert on the skin's stem cells at Rockefeller University.
	As for the liver, the detoxifier of all the natural plant poisons and drugs that pass a person's lips, its life on the chemical warfare front is quite short.
	Other tissues have lifetimes measured in years, not days, but are still far from permanent.
