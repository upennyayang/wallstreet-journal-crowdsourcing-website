	Dr. Gary I. Wadler, an associate professor of medicine at New York University and a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency, said that the Radomski case could hasten another big change in the way doping cases and drug-testing are handled. He said that baseball is on the cusp of realizing it is overwhelmed by the steroids problem and that it cannot handle it on its own.
	''I do think we are moving more and more in the direction that we'll wind up with federal legislation,'' he said. ''People can't lose sight that it's drug-dealing. Whether it's heroin or cocaine or steroids, it shouldn't matter because it's all the same.''
	What happens to the players involved, when and if their names are made public, is still in question. When asked if Major League Baseball would get players' names if Mitchell gets them, Commissioner Bud Selig said in a telephone interview, ''It's a matter we'll discuss with Senator Mitchell.''
	There are several ways that the names could come out. The players named by Radomski could be asked to testify in a grand jury investigation, similar to the athletes who were compelled to testify before the Balco grand jury.
