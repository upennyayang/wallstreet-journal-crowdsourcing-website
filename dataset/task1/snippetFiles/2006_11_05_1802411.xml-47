	Mr. Kessel, the LIPA chairman, was equally critical of Mr. Trump. ''For someone who wants to spoil Jones Beach by building a three-story monster catering hall right on the beach, and that's O.K., but windmills aren't, enough said,'' he said.
	Upstate, Another Kind of Farm
	While Long Island and New Jersey are considering offshore wind farms, the region's wind turbine projects that are furthest along are in upstate New York.
	The largest complex east of the Mississippi, Maple Ridge, on the Tug Hill Plateau in Lewis County, N.Y., generates up to 322 megawatts from 195 turbines. With the blades in the upward position, the turbines stand 390 feet tall.
	Much smaller wind farms in New York are operating in Fenner (30 megawatts), Madison (11.5 megawatts) and Wethersfield (6.6 megawatts). More than 50 projects, many expected to generate more than 100 megawatts, are seeking approvals.
	The upstate projects do have critics. Some residents in communities where they have been proposed, including Cohocton and Prattsburgh in the Finger Lakes region, are recoiling from the prospect of vistas lined with the turbines and asking whether private developers are leaving residents with turbine blight.
