	The surface of Titan seen so far is a mosaic of bright, or rugged, regions bordering dark expanses where the terrain is generally smooth and may include lakes of liquid methane and ethane. One such ''lake'' appears to be as large as Lake Champlain.
	Some places resemble a cracked eggshell, with thin bright threads running like fissures through the landscape. Broad grooves near the equator look like ridges, perhaps formed by volcanic eruptions not of molten lava but icy water or hydrocarbons.
	No mountains or deep valleys are in sight. Streaks across the flat terrain may be dunes of windblown carbon-based compounds, what passes for topsoil on Titan. Such organic material, either sticky and tarlike or powdery or slushy, may cover a ''bedrock'' of water ice to depths of a few hundred feet. Much of it, possibly ethane, propane and acetylene, must form in chemical reactions on the surface or rain out of the smoggy sky known to be rich in methane and now found to contain benzene.
	With this abundance of hydrocarbons, the sky and surface of Titan would be dangerously flammable, like a petroleum refinery primed to erupt in fire, if there were any free oxygen there.
