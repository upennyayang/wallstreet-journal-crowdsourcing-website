	The secret to the online publication's moderate success? ''They didn't buy a Super Bowl ad,'' joked Sean Bergeron, a fan from Virginia.
	It's a little more complicated than that, but not much. The company keeps its expenses low. Its creators write about what interests them. And -- here's where the business model may not be everyone's cup of Bawls Guarana energy drink -- they don't seem to care if the operation actually makes any money.
	Publishing without paper is cheap and cheap is good, said Richard Seltzer, an Internet entrepreneur and author of ''Web Business Boot Camp: Hands-on Internet Lessons for Managers, Entrepreneurs and Professionals'' (Wiley, 2002). He said online publications like Slashdot could flourish ''in a down market, and especially when the market for online advertising is in disastrous shape.''
	Slashdot persists as a must-read publication for the wizardly set, and especially those within the community of developers and fans of ''open source'' software like Linux, which is created and improved by legions of volunteers. The Web site provides the technically inclined a place to keep up with news, submit articles on their own, and discuss it all at length that can make a neophyte's head throb.
