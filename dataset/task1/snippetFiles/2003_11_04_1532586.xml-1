	There still is none.
	Ms. Guimont, now 28, remembers how hard it was to keep up with her classmates.
	''I always felt like I was on the outside looking in,'' she said.
	''Everyone was going at one pace. I was going at another. They were all going faster than I was.''
	Although no one knows to what extent damage to the brain and nervous system can be reversed, recent animal research has suggested that improvements can be made if therapy is started early in life.
	A study published last year found that with the right training, rats could overcome some of the deficits caused by alcohol exposure.
	Initially, the alcohol-exposed rats had problems with coordination, particularly in synchronizing the movements of front and rear paws, said the study's lead author, Dr. Anna Klintsova, an assistant professor at the State University of New York at Binghamton. But, after 20 days of training on an obstacle course, the rats learned how to maneuver better.
	To test the improvement, the researchers put the rodents through a ''sort of rat Olympics,'' said co-author Dr. Charles Goodlett, a professor of psychology at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis.
