	The research, he said, is helping dispel a number of false notions about pain. He said that some doctors, for example, have believed that it was somehow less worthwhile to devote time and energy toward lessening a patient's pain than it was to treat the underlying disease or injury. And as late as the late 80's, he said, ''the myth persisted that somehow what goes on in the mind, or the cells of the brain, is somehow less scientific or real than what goes on physically in the body.''
	But the fact that pain, like blood pressure or body temperature, can now be measured, Dr. Field said, will help convince doctors that patients' pain is very real. And it may give reassurance to physicians who treat the most severe chronic pain, like that of cancer patients. In the past, these doctors have often refrained from giving enough pain medication to relieve suffering out of fear that their patients might become ''hooked'' on the painkillers.
	Pain experts say that having better ways to measure pain also will help protect health insurance companies from fraudulent claims, and help policyholders prove that their claims are legitimate.
