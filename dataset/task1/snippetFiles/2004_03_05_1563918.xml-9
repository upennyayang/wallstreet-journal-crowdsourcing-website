	Other scientists familiar with the research, but not involved in it, said they agreed or were at least inclined to agree with the authors' designation of a separate species for the fossils. But they were not so sure about the authors' proposal that the fossils were so similar to those of two other recently discovered early species that all three species might have actually belonged to a single genus of closely related hominids.
	The other two hominid species are Sahelanthropus tchadensis, found in Chad and thought to be six million to seven million years old, and Orrorin tugenensis, a six-million-year-old specimen from Kenya. The two are primitive apelike creatures not much bigger than a modern chimp. Although the analysis of these remains is not complete, and still subject to debate, each has been classified as a separate genus and species.
	In their report on kadabba, Dr. Haile-Selassie and his colleagues concluded, ''Given the limited data currently available, it is possible that all of these remains represent specific or subspecific variation within a single genus.''
	Dr. White, one of the most experienced paleoanthropologists, emphasized this point in a telephone interview.
