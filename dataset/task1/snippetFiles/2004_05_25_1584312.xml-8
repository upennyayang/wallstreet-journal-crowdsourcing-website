	''I hope that's happy news,'' said Dr. Grunsfeld, an astronomer and astronaut who has been to Hubble twice. But some astronomers were skeptical that robots could do everything the astronauts were planning to do on the telescope.
	The new instruments for the Hubble, which are already built, are a wide-field camera and an ultraviolet spectrograph, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. While the camera is designed to slide in and out of the telescope like a piano-sized drawer, the spectrograph must be installed inside doors, which house other instruments and have been balky in the past.
	During the meeting, Dr. Rodger I. Thompson, an astronomer from the University of Arizona, asked a speaker, Dr. John L. Tonry from the University of Hawaii, if he would let a robot open Hubble's doors, ''with the risk that they won't be able to be closed again.''
	Dr. Tonry responded that a robot would have more time to work than an astronaut would have, and that operators on the ground would be in control of the robots anyway.
	Dr. David S. Leckrone, the Hubble project scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center, said, ''We won't open the doors unless we are confident we can close them.''
