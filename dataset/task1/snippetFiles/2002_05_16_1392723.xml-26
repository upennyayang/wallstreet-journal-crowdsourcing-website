	But as electric rates soared in the 1980's, especially in the Northeast and California, industry experts and some big users of power complained that the regulated system had failed and demanded the right to pick their own electric suppliers.
	In response to the criticism, many states forced utilities to sell most of their generating plants. Now, instead of generating their own power, the utilities buy it for consumers on newly created wholesale markets. And instead of being fixed, the price of electricity rises and falls with demand. This change has been largely invisible to consumers, since in most states retail rates are still fixed.
	But over the next few years, retail rates in several states will be deregulated, and consumers will pay prices that rise and fall along with the wholesale market -- as ratepayers in New York City, which is served by Con Edison, already do.
	If deregulation is to move forward, the independent producers need to rebuild trust among regulators and investors, Mr. Logan said. ''These companies need to show that they're managed well, they have good assets, their assets are competitive in the market, and they're not playing financial games.''
