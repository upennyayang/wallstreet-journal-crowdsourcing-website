	Ms. Larmore was a case in point. Ms. Queler was first alerted to her by Ms. Fleming, who was singing with her in Switzerland, and Ms. Queler immediately engaged her for Bellini's ''Capuleti e i Montecchi'' the next season (1993-4). Ms. Larmore was already in consideration for the Richard Tucker Award, a major grant for promising singers, which she won in 1994, but her Opera Orchestra debut came before the announcement was made. She was promptly booked at the Met. Ms. Larmore herself gives Ms. Queler full credit for her discovery.
	Among this year's new singers is Angela Gilbert, who will sing Inez -- Ms. Hendricks's role, with the cadenzas Ms. Queler wrote for Ms. Hendricks -- in ''La Favorita'' on Wednesday.
	Participants in the Young Artists Program have no guarantee of this kind of spotlight. If Ms. Queler thinks a singer might cancel, she will often engage a second, ''secret'' cover to go in for the Carnegie Hall performance. Nor is hers an entry-level program; singers are more likely to be drawn from the rosters of artists' managers -- especially that of Ms. Queler's own manager, Robert Lombardo -- than from the hundreds of résumés the Opera Orchestra receives for each available slot.
