	Depending on whom one asks and how one counts, travel is the biggest, or one of the biggest, categories of spending by on-line consumers. Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., estimates that total spending for on-line travel bookings last year, counting airlines, hotels, rental cars, tours and cruises, was $3 billion.
	Estimates of future bookings vary, but Fiona Swerdlow, a digital commerce analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York, said the research company predicted in April that on-line leisure travel spending by consumers would rocket to $11.7 billion by the year 2002. The figure does not include business travel booked through corporate travel agencies, and the increased presence of cruise and tour companies offering bookings on the Web recently may make the total even higher, she said.
	Travel-specific sites on the World Wide Web are reporting surges of visitors, as consumers become more comfortable researching trips, buying tickets and reserving rooms on line. According to NPD Online Research, a division of NPD Group in Port Washington, N.Y., nearly 70 percent of Web users -- and there are more than 70 million in America alone, according to some studies -- say they have visited a travel-related site at some time.
