	But aspects of the lost New York live again. Already, the Series is a political opportunity (with the Republican Senate candidate, Rick A. Lazio, hyping the Mets, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democrat, promoting the Bombers). It isn't the first time. In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower arrived at the first game in an open campaign car and Adlai E. Stevenson, the Democratic nominee, was cheered at the next game.
	Just as writers, painters, photographers, designers, musicians and celebrity chefs have put millennial New York on the cutting edge of innovation, the Dodger-Yankee town was a festival of modern dance experimentation, abstract expressionism, bold Broadway musicals, culinary creativity pioneered by the likes of James Beard, transgressive jazz and doo-wop on the street corners.
	While the 14th Subway Series introduces a new generation to a 79-year-old city tradition, it will surely provoke a rush of memories for New Yorkers older than 50. ''It's feeling a lot like deja vu all over again,'' said Yogi Berra, reprising one of his more celebrated Yogi-isms.
	In the end, maybe the first Subway Series between the Yankees and the Mets is a triumph of continuity and revival for a city rich in both history and baseball.
