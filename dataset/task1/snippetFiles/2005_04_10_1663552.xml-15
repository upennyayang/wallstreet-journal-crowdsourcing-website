	English baseball, meanwhile, was itself the product of a prolonged, nonlinear evolution. ''Tut-ball,'' which Block describes as ''a simple hit-the-ball, catch-the-ball, run-the-bases type of game,'' may have been its immediate predecessor. Records of tut date as far back as 1519, when the Priory of Hexham threatened anyone caught playing the game in the local cemetery with excommunication. An earlier sport, ''stool-ball,'' may have been even more influential in baseball's evolution, and is also a likely parent of cricket, which developed independently. (Rounders, it turns out, was merely a regional variant of baseball.) England, it would appear, has never had a shortage of ball sports. A 1477 edict issued by Edward IV blamed a fixation on such frivolous pastimes for the dissipation of military skill in his kingdom (sword-fighting and archery had become pass√©). Medieval texts suggest baseball's English antecedents may themselves have descended from Continental bat-and-ball games. An illustration in ''The Romance of Alexander,'' a French manuscript from 1344, depicts a group of monks and nuns engaged in a game, thought to be ''la soule,'' that looks a lot like coed softball (no sign of a keg, however).
