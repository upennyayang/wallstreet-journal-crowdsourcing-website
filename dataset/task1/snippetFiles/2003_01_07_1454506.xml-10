	Even with a tiny camera attached to his head and a battery and transmitter strapped to his back, the spaniel, Romeo, proved to be ''a good Frisbee dog,'' said Dr. Krauchunas, who borrowed him from a student.
	''He may have felt a little restricted at first, but as soon as you showed him the Frisbee, he just wanted to go catch it,'' Dr. Krauchunas said.
	The camera recorded a moment-to-moment snapshot of the Frisbee as seen by Romeo at different points on his running course. This image stream was transmitted to a nearby computer.
	From an analysis of recordings for 37 throws, most of them caught successfully, the researchers found that the dog's path closely followed the expectations from the LOT model. When the Frisbee changed course in midflight, the dog seemed to reset his navigational system and proceeded to keep the image moving along a new straight line.
	In a poster presentation in November at the Psychonomics Society in Orlando, the researchers showed that the dog was using one straight-line trajectory to track the Frisbee from the thrower's hand to the point where it curved in the air, and then a second from this turning point to the landing spot.
