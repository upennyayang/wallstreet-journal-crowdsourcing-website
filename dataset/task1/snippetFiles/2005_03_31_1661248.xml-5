	Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the Jets, the Islanders and one other professional team for whom he works as team doctor -- the Dragons of the Arena Football League -- said in statements yesterday that they supported Pellman and would continue to rely on him for medical advice.
	Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and ranking minority member of the House committee, said in an interview yesterday that Pellman's exaggerations had added fuel to the doubts members of Congress already had about baseball's steroids policy.
	Waxman said that at the nationally televised committee hearing on March 17, questions were raised about Pellman's credibility, because he did not know some details of baseball's steroids policy. Waxman said Pellman had added to those doubts.
	When Pellman testified at the Congressional hearing, he supported baseball's steroids policies and challenged the policies' critics. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig had touted Pellman as his medical expert on the subject.
	The commissioner's office said in a statement yesterday that Major League Baseball was concerned about the report of inaccuracies in Pellman's credentials and expected him to correct the public record.
