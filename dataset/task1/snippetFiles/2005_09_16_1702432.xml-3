	While there is no doubt that elections are a worthy goal, we will not be able to change the Muslim world or dislodge the militancy until we gain a better understanding of the roots of the problem. While these conflicts are often painted as millennium-old, they are essentially modern phenomena, bred of postcolonial politics, social upheavals and territorial struggles.
	And as we look at the causes of anti-Western jihadism, we tend to overlook one major contributing factor: the absence not just of democracy but also of grass-roots representative institutions like a free press and independent political, cultural and social-welfare institutions.
	Today's jihadists -- I call them ''neo-fundamentalists,'' because they are a world apart from earlier fundamentalists -- are not throwbacks to the crusades, nor are they, as President Bush unfortunately put it, just ''a group of folks.'' They are a singular and recent byproduct of decades of oppressive rule.
	Yes, the Muslim world had an unfortunate introduction to post-Enlightenment ideals, which came in the context of invasion, colonialism and exploitation. But the Arab philosophical and political movement that came out of that experience was not inherently anti-Western.
