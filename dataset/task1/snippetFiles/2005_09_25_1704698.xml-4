	On, if you can take it, to the interjection yuck. In early 60's theatrical slang, it imitated the sound of laughter, and comedians would ''yuck it up'' to induce yuck-yucking in the audience. Within a decade, its meaning underwent an extreme makeover, perhaps having to do with certain stomach-turning jokes, and yuck turned into an expression of nose-wrinkling disapprobation. Seventeen years ago in this space, I wrote that ''beginning in 1970, the word took the adjective form yucky and gained the sense of 'nasty, sloppy.'. . .It seems to have triumphed over the similar icky, has resisted replacement by gross and its derivative grody, but is now being challenged by a variant form, the interjection yecch and its adjectival yecchy. I predict yucky will persevere.''
	I was too quick to cast out ick. Though usage of yucky is fading, yecch! -- with its back-of-the-tongue concluding sound -- turned out to have legs in expressing revulsion, while the interjection or exclamation ick! is showing real staying power, especially in its mock-serious combination with factor.
	''I see this as a case of embodied cognition,'' says David McNeill, emeritus professor of psychology and linguistics at the University of Chicago.
