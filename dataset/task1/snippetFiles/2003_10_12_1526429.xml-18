	Johnson had come to terms with the burden of the work by the expedient of funneling it on to his own desk. ''I . . . contracted my design, determined to confide in myself, and no longer to solicit auxiliaries, which produced more incumbrance than assistance; by this I obtained at least one advantage, that I set limits to my work, which would in time be ended, though not completed.'' Murray did not try to impose such restrictions upon himself, indeed could not conceivably have done so given the scope of the undertaking. He died in 1915, working at his desk up until the week before the end, which came 35 years after he took on the assignment. The dictionary was completed in 1928, the greatest publishing enterprise in the history of the world.
	SIMON WINCHESTER'S book ''The Meaning of Everything'' tells the story of the Oxford English Dictionary. It is teeming with knowledge and alive with insights. Winchester handles humor and awe with modesty and cunning. His devotion to the story is the more eloquent for the cool-handedness of its telling. His prose is supremely readable, admirable in its lucid handling of lexicographical mire.
