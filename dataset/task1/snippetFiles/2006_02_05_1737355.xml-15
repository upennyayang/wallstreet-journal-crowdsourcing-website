	''I want to help make humanity a space-faring civilization,'' he said with disarming -- or alarming -- candor.
	SpaceX's first effort, the Falcon 1, will not put anyone on the moon. It is designed to send small satellites -- typically communications and scientific payloads weighing less than 1,000 pounds -- into low orbit, which is up to 300 miles above the Earth. The two-stage Falcon 1 is designed to be mostly recyclable, with part of it falling into the ocean to be picked up and used again.
	The Falcon 1 will charge $6.9 million a launching. It is intended to go head to head with the Pegasus rocket made by the Orbital Sciences Corporation of Dulles, Va., which charges $25 million to $30 million for the same launching, as well as rockets from such newcomers as India and Israel.
	Next up are the Falcon 5, the same rocket with five engines, and the Falcon 9, with nine engines. The Falcon 9 would bring SpaceX into direct competition with Boeing's Delta 4 and Lockheed's Atlas 5 in the so-called heavy-lift market, in which the United States government is the main customer.
