	Now physicists, some of whom have been reluctant to take acceleration of the universe seriously, will have to explain what this dark energy is. ''Those numbers are alarming, and apparently true,'' said Dr. Michael Dine, a theoretical physicist from the University of California at Santa Cruz. He described his colleagues as now working ''frantically'' to find an explanation.
	On one level, the universe, with all of its dark baggage, seems to make sense. The total amount of matter and energy seems to be just enough to guarantee that the large-scale geometry of space-time is ''flat,'' or Euclidean, a result that cosmologists have long considered to be the most desirable and aesthetic. On the other hand, the detailed breakdown of the constituents of the cosmos is, as Dr. Livio says, ''ugly'' -- 65 percent dark matter, 30 percent dark matter of unknown nature and only 5 percent stars, gas and dust.
	''We live in a preposterous universe,'' said Dr. Michael Turner, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago. ''Dark energy. Who ordered that?''
	Of course, it was Einstein who originally ordered dark energy when he inserted a fudge factor called the cosmological constant into his gravitational equations describing the universe.
