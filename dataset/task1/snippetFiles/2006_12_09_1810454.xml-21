	When he was 6, his family had to flee to a remote mountainside to escape the fighting during the Korean War. ''We were safe and in a place where neither the South Korean nor North Korean armies would come, but we were poor and hungry,'' he said. ''I could see the fighter jets bombing the towns and cities nearby.''
	The experience led to his first sighting of Americans. ''After the war, the American soldiers would throw biscuits and chocolates and chewing gum to us, and all our clothes were given to us by America,'' he said.
	A later encounter with Western ways occurred when American technicians came to his town in the 1950s to help build a fertilizer factory, and he still recalls it with shock.
	''I was startled one summer when I met for the first time one of the daughters, and she was sitting there with hot pants and her two legs stretched out in front of me, a young country boy,'' he said. ''I didn't know where to place my eyes, where to focus. It would have been a matter of shame for any Korean lady at that time.''
