	The Army recruiting psychiatrist had only one question for John Tyler Bonner: ''Do you consider yourself normal?'' ''Yes,'' Bonner said, after a brief hesitation. Officer material, the psychiatrist noted. Presumably this ploy no longer works, as too many people know the answer, but in 1941 it was brilliant: anyone who questions his own normality, whether from self-doubt or from hubris, will not be a leader of men.
	Scientists mostly live in a shade that is disproportionately deep compared with their importance to society and the changes they make in our world. Try naming the top 10 scientists of all time, or the top 10 inventors, and then name the top 10 composers or painters. With the creative artists we have a hard time choosing; with the scientists or engineers, a hard time reaching 10. The lives of scientists, though, are our business: the problem is that, give or take the usual variation in ambition and niceness, they are so normal and their lives so relatively incident-free.
	The major incidents in Bonner's career arose because it spanned much of the world-changing development of biological science in the 20th century.
