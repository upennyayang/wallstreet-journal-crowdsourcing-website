	Dr. Shapiro was struck by the way DNA's transformation within cells resembled the operation of a Turing machine. Developed in 1936 by the British mathematician Alan Turing, the conceptual device used a mechanism that worked with two strips of paper divided into cells. The machine would move along both tapes at the same time -- reading symbols written within the input tape cells, comparing them with instructions stored its memory and then writing symbols on the output tape. At the end, it would provide a yes-or-no answer about the list of input-table symbols. For example, it could say whether an input tape marked with the letters A and B had an even number of B's.
	With the Turing machine as its model, in late 2001 Dr. Shapiro's group produced the first DNA computer that could produce results without having humans guide its molecular reactions (the computer's method of calculation). For the input tape in their machine, the Weizmann researchers used specially engineered strands of DNA. It became the computer's software.
	Much like the symbols on the tape in the Turing machine, DNA strands store genetic information in a four-letter alphabet.
