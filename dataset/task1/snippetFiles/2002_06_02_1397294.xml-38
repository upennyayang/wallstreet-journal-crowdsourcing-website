	Williams portrays itself as the industry leader in risk management. The phrase is ubiquitous in its pitches to investors.
	Mr. Murphy saw a different picture. Williams, he said, had failed to reduce financial risks across the board, but when he offered his ideas, he was turned away. An astrophysicist trained at the California Institute of Technology and speaks with a blunt confidence that comes from his education and his New York upbringing, Mr. Murphy was an outsider among the oil-patch veterans at Williams. He recalls being told many times that as a Wall Streeter, he understood little about trading natural gas and power, though firms like Goldman, Sachs are among the biggest in the business.
	Mr. Hobbs concurred that Mr. Murphy was an outsider, and said that explains the outlandishness of his accusation about cornering the natural gas market in California. ''I think you are dealing with an employee who is not informed,'' he said, ''and that explains why he is no longer with Williams.''
	But Mr. Murphy countered that the company was just not willing to listen to people who questioned the status quo. ''They were so entrenched in their ways, and there was such deep ambivalence,'' he said.
