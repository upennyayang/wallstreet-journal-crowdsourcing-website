	But the fishermen say they know the ocean best: they spend their lives working it rather than writing research papers about it. Changes in ocean conditions simply require adjustment, they say, whether that means shortening lines or fishing closer in or farther out. By and large, they are not worried. They cite the state's record 2005 crab harvest, 33.7 million pounds, and another strong harvest, 27.5 million pounds, in the season just ended. ''There's all kinds of cycles in the ocean,'' said Jim Emory, a 41-year-old fisherman whose boat is named Monde Uni. ''It is what it is. It's an opportunity.'' Some scientists, too, are being cautious. Jane Lubchenco, a zoologist who specializes in marine ecology at Oregon State and who has long been outspoken about global warming threats, is among those who say that while the findings here are fascinating, more data, collected over a longer period of time, are needed. ''We can't say with absolute certainty that this has never happened before,'' said Ms. Lubchenco, former president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, who has worked at Oregon State since 1978.
