	The group advocates spending $2 billion to build one or two sample nuclear reactors using advanced technology. It also supports building electricity plants that cook coal to produce combustible gases, which are then burned in turbines like those used at natural gas plants. This approach leaves open the possibility that carbon dioxide can be captured to prevent global warming.
	The study gives short shrift to several perennial ideas on energy. Hydrogen, championed by the current President Bush in the 2003 State of the Union speech, fails on at least two of the four criteria the commission said a new technology should have: being compatible with the existing distribution infrastructure, and being competitive with gasoline by 2020. The commission cited an estimate by the National Academy of Sciences that full development of hydrogen technology is 50 years away.
	It was not enthusiastic about corn ethanol, because its potential to replace gasoline is limited and the reduction of carbon dioxide is modest. And it costs twice what gasoline does, the report said. Another possibility, the authors said, was an emerging technology, ethanol made from the woody part of plants.
	The report also did not stress ordering electric companies to buy more power from solar and wind plants and other renewable sources.
