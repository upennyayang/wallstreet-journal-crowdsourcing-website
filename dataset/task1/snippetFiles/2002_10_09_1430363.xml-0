	The brains of children and adolescents in whom attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is diagnosed are on average 3 percent to 4 percent smaller in volume than those of children without the condition, according to a large-scale government study whose findings were reported today.
	And the greater the severity of a child's symptoms, the greater the discrepancy in the size of various brain areas, as measured on brain scans, the researchers said.
	Disparities in brain volume have been found before in children with the disorder, differences that some had speculated might be a result of the medications commonly used to treat such children.
	But the new work, reported today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, found the difference was present even among children who had never taken medication.
	''I've always been extremely cautious about overinterpreting results,'' said Dr. F. Xavier Castellanos, the lead author, who directed the study at the National Institute of Mental Health. ''But I think this is a definitive finding and something that needs to be considered.''
	Still, Dr. Castellanos, now at New York University's Child Study Center, said the difference in overall brain size was ''not huge.''
