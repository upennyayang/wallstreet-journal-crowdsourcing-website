	''I think they have a sticky switch between the hemispheres,'' he said. If the switch is stuck, it may be possible to unstick it, Dr. Pettigrew said, by turning to a strange observation made several years ago by Italian scientists.
	''If you tilt a person's head 30 degrees to the side and put ice water into one ear, the opposite brain hemisphere will become activated,'' he said. Thus cold water in the left ear, activating the right hemisphere, might temporarily reduce the symptoms of mania. Depression might be temporarily reduced by placing cold water in the right ear.
	Ice water in the ear is a traditional neurological test that has been performed, among other things, on astronauts in space to help understand space sickness. How ice water stimulates one hemisphere is not precisely known, but it seems to activate orientation pathways in one ear (which tell people where they are in space), and these pathways are connected to mid- and higher-brain regions in the opposite side of the head, Dr. Pettigrew said. Trying the ice water in his own left ear, Dr. Pettigrew, who suffers from manic depression, said, ''I sat on my couch at home for 40 hours, ruminating about my life.''
