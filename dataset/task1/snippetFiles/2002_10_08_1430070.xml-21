	The researchers found that among the subjects who completed the questionnaire free from distraction, the usual sex difference appeared, with more women choosing emotional infidelity. But among the subjects who had to remember the numbers, there was no sex difference; women, as well as men, identified sexual infidelity as the most upsetting.
	''The fact that women's responses on the forced-choice measure mirrored those of men argues forcefully against the existence of innate sex differences,'' the researchers wrote.
	Dr. Buss, however, said he failed to find the new research convincing. Dr. DeSteno and his colleagues, Dr. Buss said, had distorted the claims of evolutionary psychology.
	''These authors take a kind of rigid, robotic, stereotypic and false depiction of the evolutionary hypothesis and then show that those robotic depictions are wrong,'' Dr. Buss said. ''I could develop any number of contexts in which you could make the sex differences in jealousy disappear; the fact that you could create a laboratory experiment in which you do so is, in my view, a meaningless and trivial demonstration.''
	Besides, he added, a smaller study, published this year, found sex differences even when methods other than forced-choice were used to determine preferences.
