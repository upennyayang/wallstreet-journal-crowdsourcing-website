	If the parameter w comes out to be something other than minus 1, Dr. Krauss said, it will at least give some direction to physicists.
	One encouraging sign -- ''a tantalizing bit of hope,'' in Dr. Krauss's words -- that the data will distinguish between a cosmological constant and the other possibilities came last fall when Dr. Riess, of Baltimore, reported, based on new observations of distant supernovas, that the ''cosmic jerk'' when dark energy took over the universe happened only five billion years ago.
	In the standard cosmological constant model, said Dr. Riess, the turnaround should have come one or two billion years earlier.
	Dr. Tyson was more sanguine. ''Dark energy is crazy, right?'' he said. ''It's going to be exciting no matter what we find.''
	Dark Future for Dark Energy?
	The work of the dark energy hunters has been complicated by the impending loss of the Hubble Space Telescope, which can see far enough out in space and time to measure how and if the dark energy parameter w is changing over the eons.
	Last month, citing safety, NASA canceled all future shuttle maintenance missions to the telescope, dooming it to die in orbit, probably within three years, according to astronomers.
