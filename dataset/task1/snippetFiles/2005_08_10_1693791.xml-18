	On paper, the goals of this mission were straightforward: resupplying the space station and testing an external tank that had been modified so as not to shed the kind of launching debris that doomed the Columbia.
	But the crew -- Colonel Collins and Col. James M. Kelly, Stephen K. Robinson, Wendy B. Lawrence, Charles J. Camarda, Andrew S.W. Thomas and Soichi Noguchi of Japan -- ended up having a busy two weeks.
	They tested new technologies and techniques for detecting, measuring and repairing damage to insulating tiles and panels. They produced startling photography from space and conducted a bold spacewalk to pull dangling bits of cloth from the shuttle's underbelly, a procedure that the spacewalker Dr. Robinson called ''the first baby step'' to developing the capability for repair while in orbit. And, of course, there was the dramatic landing.
	The shuttle was originally supposed to come home to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. But unpredictable weather and rain uncomfortably close to the center led mission managers to ''wave off'' four Florida landing opportunities in two days, and finally to call for a change of plans.
	''How do you feel about a beautiful, clear night with a breeze down the runway in the high desert of California?''
