	In the Senate, Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who recently won a hard-fought primary in his state with Mr. Bush's help and has long been a proponent of the research, is drafting a similar letter. And the Republican leader, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, told reporters on Tuesday that while he supported the president's policy he would like to see it reviewed.
	''It's been three years and I think it's time to do it,'' said Dr. Frist, a heart surgeon who was influential in persuading Mr. Bush to take up the stem-cell issue in the summer of 2001. He added, ''I'm very interested in answering the question whether or not scientists are really leaving this country in droves because of the limitations on research.''
	A White House spokesman said Wednesday that the president would not expand the policy. But the presumptive Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, was an early proponent of embryonic stem-cell research and has been using his stump speeches to criticize the Bush administration as choosing ideology over science. At a recent fund-raiser in Harrisburg, Pa., Mr. Kerry made a point of mentioning diabetes research, which he said Mr. Bush had no plan for.
