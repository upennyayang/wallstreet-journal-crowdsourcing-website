	The second part of their study looks not at spending but at a more direct measure of well-being: how respondents assess their personal happiness.
	After all, Professor Dehejia said, ''If you take the doctrine of religion seriously, then what religion actually does is it doesn't insure your income but it changes how you react to the negative shocks you face.''
	Here, the economists use the National Survey of Families and Households which, among other questions, asks respondents to rate their happiness on a seven-point scale. Because the survey interviewed the same people in 1987-88 and 1992-94, the economists can compare how the same people responded over time.
	Unlike the consumption survey, which records only donations, this one has more detail on religious beliefs and activities. (It does not, however, measure gifts.)
	Using religious attendance as their measure of affiliation, the economists get a strikingly different result by race. While whites get no significant ''happiness insurance'' from religious affiliation, blacks get a lot.
	''The median level of religious attendance reduces the happiness impact of income shocks by blacks by about 75 percent,'' they write. The effect is greatest among those with a high school education or less.
