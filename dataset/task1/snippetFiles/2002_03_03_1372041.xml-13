	Meanwhile, both the Pasteur Institute and Gallo's team applied for patents for a test that could detect the virus. After the Patent and Trademark Office awarded the patent to Gallo's group in May 1985, the Pasteur Institute sued, contending it had discovered the virus used in the Gallo test. When the French produced supporting records, Gallo retorted that their ''meticulous and apparently premeditated documentation'' showed they cared more about ''patents and notoriety'' than about good science. He also kept churning out revised versions of his own discovery of the AIDS virus, contending in one paper that he had isolated it as early as 1982.
	The dispute eventually reached President Ronald Reagan and the French prime minister, Jacques Chirac, who in March 1987 declared a truce by agreeing that the Americans and the French would share the patent for the AIDS blood test. Somehow, Gallo's bluster had convinced some American officials and prominent journalists that, at the least, he deserved credit for independently discovering the cause of AIDS and developing a test for the virus.
	In 1989, however, the National Institutes of Health started looking into Crewdson's assertion in his newspaper that Gallo's ''discovery'' was ''either an accident or a theft.''
