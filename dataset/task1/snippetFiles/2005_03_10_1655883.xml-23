	Soon, Christianity Today ran an editorial endorsing a bill sponsored by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, along with Mr. Lieberman, that would include binding curbs on heat-trapping gases. Mr. Ball said the strongest moral argument he made to fellow evangelicals was that climate change would have disproportionate effects on the poorest regions in the world. Hurricanes, droughts and floods are widely expected to intensify as a result of climate change.
	Evangelical leaders of relief and development organizations had been very receptive, he said.
	''Christ said, 'What you do to the least of these you do to me,''' Mr. Ball said. ''And so caring for the poor by reducing the threat of global warming is caring for Jesus Christ.''
	Among those speaking at the two meetings this week are Sir John and Dr. Mack McFarland, environmental manager for DuPont, who is to describe how his company has greatly reduced emissions of heat-trapping gases.
	Such an approach appeals to evangelicals, Mr. Haggard said, adding, ''We want to be pro-business environmentalists.''
	Mr. Cizik said he was among many evangelicals who would support some regulation on heat-trapping gases.
	''We're not adverse to government-mandated prohibitions on behavioral sin such as abortion,'' he said.
