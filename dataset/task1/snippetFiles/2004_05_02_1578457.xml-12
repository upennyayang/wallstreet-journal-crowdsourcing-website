	''In the six years I have been doing it, I have yet to document that once,'' Dr. Tepper said. ''It's just that ponds crash.'' Just because the water is clear doesn't mean the aquatic environment is O.K. ''The two deadliest metabolites we deal with, ammonia and nitrite, are clear in water,'' Dr. Tepper said. ''And yet most people are concerned when water is green and murky with algae when in fact that is generally healthy water.'' When he started practicing in 1978, Dr. Tepper was one of the first animal doctors with a specialty in avian medicine. His training was at the University of Li√®ge in Belgium, where pigeon racing is a local tradition. It made doctoring birds a natural. Six years ago, after requests from several clients who didn't know where to turn for help with their fish, he enrolled in post-professional courses at the University of Georgia. ''I had always been a fish hobbyist and I never thought about putting the two together until the koi craze really started taking off,'' Dr. Tepper said. ''That's fueled this new interest in pet-fish medicine.''
