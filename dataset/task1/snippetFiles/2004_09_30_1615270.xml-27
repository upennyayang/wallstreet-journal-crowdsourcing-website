	I ran to the expensive children's boutique. The $68 poncho in town had sold out. Dimly I remembered that gapkids.com had ponchos too. With the clock ticking, I drove to the nearest Gap Kids, rushed into the store as if delivering the Olympic torch and lunged at a rack of multistriped lamb's wool ponchos. Size medium looked big enough. It was only as I signed the credit card slip at the cash register that I looked at the price: $44. At that point, I would have paid anything.
	The poncho was the hit of Clementine's birthday.
	In 80-degree weather, she wore it to school. All day. I picked her up, red-faced, at 4 p.m.
	''Isn't the poncho a little hot for today?'' I asked.
	''No,'' she said. She said her backpack was to blame for her sweaty, glazed look.
	''It's heavy and now I have to carry it in my arms because it doesn't fit over my poncho,'' she said.
	I glanced around the playground at all the other little girls in ponchos. They were pulling backpacks on wheels.
	''No new backpack,'' I said automatically.
