	Government officials said the country had not planned for the effects of continued global warming. No in-depth studies have been conducted, and no plans for building or improving reservoirs and other infrastructure are even on the drawing board.
	''The problem is we are using reserves that are being reduced,'' Mr. Gallaire said. ''So we have to ask, what will happen in 50 years? Fifty years, you know, is tomorrow.''
	The most pressing concern, government officials said, is the possible shortage of water for the 1.5 million people of La Paz and the adjacent city of El Alto. Over the next decade, water use in the region is expected to increase by 20 percent.
	Scientists say that without the glaciers the region's natural water cycle will be disrupted. Glaciers release water in dry seasons and collect it in rainy ones.
	''It's a natural dam,'' said Lonnie Thompson, a research scientist at the Byrd Center who has studied Andean glaciers closely. ''Some people refer to these glaciers as the world's water towers, and once they're dry, you lose that water.''
	For now, at Aguas de Illimani, the French company that runs La Paz's water supply, the situation is not seen as critical.
