	The technique could also change some materials in unpredictable ways. For example, electrons can bounce around inside minerals, including gemstones and glass, in ways that change the color of the material. Topaz is routinely modified commercially from clear to blue through ion beam sterilization, though at greater energy levels than those proposed for sanitizing the mail. Mineralogists said similar reactions could occur in glass at the energy levels being considered by companies competing for postal contracts. The consequences would vary tremendously depending on the type of glass, but clear glass could turn brown, for example, said Dr. George R. Rossman, a professor of mineralogy at the California Institute of Technology. Dr. Rossman said he was also concerned that using this process to sterilize the mail could damage or alter mailed materials being studied by scientists. For example, pottery shards are sometimes dated by heating them and measuring minute amounts of light emitted. The light is a measure of how much natural radiation the clays absorbed over millenniums, Dr. Rossman said, but ion beam sterilization would confuse calculations. Gerry Kreienkamp, a spokesman for the post office, emphasized that the service was still in the early stages of deciding how to handle the new risk and the technologies chosen to reduce it.
