	In recent days, the administration has worked on a compromise that it hopes will sidestep opposition from the Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden. Under the terms of a tentative deal with the Mets, which does not require City Council approval, the Mets would pay a modest rent and control the 6,500 seat stadium year-round. The city would have the right to hold at least 20 public events at the stadium, but the Mets, like the Staten Island Yankees, would get all the ticket and parking revenue, half the advertising revenue and 70 percent of the revenue from events booked into the stadium during the nine months of the year the team would not play there. The two sides are negotiating the split on concessions. The city has said that non-baseball events would also attract new visitors and generate tax revenue and new businesses on Surf Avenue, where flea markets, the Cyclone roller coaster and a dwindling number of other rides are all that remain of the once-bustling amusement district. ''This will be an asset the city, and the Mets will seek to generate as much activity as possible,'' Mr. Carey said.
