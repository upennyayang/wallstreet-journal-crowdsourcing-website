	Doing back-office chores for advanced economies may not sound glamorous, especially for a nation that has created an $8 billion computer software industry virtually from scratch in the last decade. But it could spread the wealth of India's technology revolution beyond the pockets of prosperity that exist today in Bangalore, Hyderabad and a few other hubs of high technology.
	''Right now, when you come to our campus, you're leaving India behind,'' said N. R. Narayana Murthy, the chairman of Infosys Technologies, one of India's most successful software companies and the first to be listed on Nasdaq. ''We're living in a make-believe world.''
	With its putting green, aerobics studio, basketball court and even a deer park, the Infosys headquarters is a powerful symbol of what technology has brought to India since the late 1980's. Companies like Infosys and the rival Wipro Ltd. are deeply embedded in the microchips of dozens of the largest American businesses.
	Unlike Taiwan or South Korea, which became known as low-cost producers of computer hardware, India made its name as an unparalleled customer service agent. While their American clients sleep, software writers churn out code, which is then beamed by satellite to the United States.
