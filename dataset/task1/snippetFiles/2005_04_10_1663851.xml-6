	How could we go about identifying ''life as we don't know it''? One idea is to look in exotic environments. The range of conditions in which life can thrive has been enormously extended in recent years, with the discovery of microbes dwelling near scalding volcanic vents, in radioactive pools and in pitch darkness far underground. Yet there will be limits beyond which our form of life cannot survive; for example, temperatures above about 270 degrees Fahrenheit. If anything is found living in even harsher environments, we could scrutinize its innards to see whether what makes it tick is so novel that it cannot have evolved from known life.
	Identifying alien organisms in more equable settings would be a much harder challenge, especially if they use the same basic molecules as familiar life -- nucleic acids and proteins. But there is one sure-fire giveaway. The building blocks of proteins, called amino acids, are all lopsided in the same distinctive way. Viewed in a mirror, these ''left-handed'' amino acids would appear right-handed. Such mirror-image molecules exist, but the life forms we are familiar with don't use them.
