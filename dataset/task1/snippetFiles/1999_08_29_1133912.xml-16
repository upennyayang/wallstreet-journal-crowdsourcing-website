	Ms. Pendergast, he said, is definitely the person to lead the Connecticut survey, because she's ''a first-rate birder'' with many connections to the birding community, which he hopes is source of volunteer monitors. Ms. Pendergast, 45, is a a lifelong birder and vice president of the Connecticut Ornithological Association. She is a former lobbyist for the National Audubon Society. Mr. Robbins, 35, is a graduate student at Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.
	At the Salt Meadow Unit, the surveyors noted the train tracks crossing the marsh and the building that's now headquarters for the entire McKinney Refuge, which includes six units along the Connecticut coast. The building was once the home of Esther Lape and Elizabeth Read, whose friend Eleanor Roosevelt sometimes got off the train right there, to visit.
	''She had her own stop,'' Mr. Robbins said.
	Soon he and Ms. Pendergast pointed eagerly to a shallow pool, called a panne, where egrets, willets, and other birds were feeding.
	''There's all kinds of life in there: fiddler crabs, little fish, insect larvae,'' Mr. Robbins said. ''It represents the whole food chain: bacteria, vegetation, insect larvae, fish, birds.''
