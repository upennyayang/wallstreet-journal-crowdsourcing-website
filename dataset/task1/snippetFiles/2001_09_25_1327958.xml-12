	After subjects read moral dilemmas, like the footbridge or trolley problem, they pressed buttons to indicate if they judged the action proposed to be appropriate or inappropriate. Some dilemmas were personal while others were impersonal. Impersonal moral dilemmas, like deciding whether to keep the money in a found wallet, activated areas involved in working memory, Mr. Greene said.
	Personal moral dilemmas, like the footbridge problem, suppressed working memory areas and activated emotional circuits. These areas were not classical emotional regions, like the amygdala, but two other areas in the front and middle of the brain, near the crack where the hemispheres meet. Other imaging studies show that these frontal regions are involved in high order emotional processing, Dr. Cohen said.
	In considering the footbridge dilemma, some subjects decided it was appropriate to push the stranger off the bridge, Mr. Greene said. But it took them longer to reach their decisions than those who said it was inappropriate to kill the stranger. It may be impossible to suppress the emotional reaction to personal moral situations, he said, but those gut feelings can be overridden by other parts of the reasoning brain.
