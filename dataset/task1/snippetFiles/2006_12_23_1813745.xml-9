	MR. JOUSSE became one of the world's foremost urban lighting experts by accident. A native of Paris, he landed a job in 1963 with the city's engineering division after graduating from college, helping widen and deepen the city's canals. He later had jobs supervising 3,000 garbage collectors and creating pedestrian streets.
	In 1981, a supervisor asked him to change course once again. ''He wanted someone who would not be caught up in daily work and could think about light,'' Mr. Jousse said. ''I knew a little bit about electricity, and I was an amateur photographer. So he invented a job for me.''
	At the time, most of the Paris monuments were either unlighted or only crudely illuminated with big spotlights that shone directly onto the facades. Mr. Jousse sought out urban architects and theatrical lighting experts for ideas and technical training.
	He eventually created a research laboratory for the city of Paris, where he and a team began to create fixtures and to experiment with the color and intensity of light. The city now spends about $260,000 a day on its lighting.
	But that does not mean everything runs smoothly.
