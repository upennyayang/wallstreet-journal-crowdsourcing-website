	Eight years ago, researchers led by Rodney Ruoff, a professor of nanoengineering who is now at Northwestern University, reported that he had rubbed tiny pillars of graphite against a silicon wafer surface, causing them to spread out like a deck of cards. He suggested that the technique could produce single-layer graphene, but he did not measure the flakes' thickness. Philip Kim, a professor of physics at Columbia, took a similar approach in making a ''nanopencil,'' attaching a graphite crystal to the tip of an atomic force microscope and dragging it along a surface. He, too, found graphite cleaved into flakes. But the flakes, as thin as five-billionths of a meter, nevertheless consisted of probably at least 10 layers of atoms.
	''We were pretty happy with this result back then,'' said Dr. Kim, who presented the research in March 2004. ''And then everything got changed a few months later.''
	In September 2004, Dr. Kim saw a preprint of a paper by researchers led by Andre Geim, a physics professor at the University of Manchester in England. They had made single-layer graphene.
	More surprising was the technique.
	Reading the preprint, Dr. Kim abandoned his nanopencil.
