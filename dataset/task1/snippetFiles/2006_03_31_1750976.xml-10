	Should Mitchell's investigation find that Jose Canseco was right in saying that a majority of players used steroids, will his report, which Selig said would be made public, reflect that finding, potentially harming the game by turning off fans and viewers? Such a result could be damaging for baseball and ESPN. We can only wait and see the report. When John Dowd, the Washington lawyer, investigated Pete Rose in 1989 for betting on baseball games, everything he found was published. The report and its exhibits became public because of a lawsuit, but this time we can expect full disclosure without the litigation. If we get less, we will have reason to question Mitchell's integrity, and baseball cannot afford to have fans or members of Congress or the news media conclude that the investigation was a sham. Selig said Mitchell's leadership of the investigation ensured that it would be ''thorough and fair.'' Mitchell said the investigation would be ''thorough, objective and fair.'' Although Mitchell will head the investigation, he will have three lawyers assisting him, one from his law firm and two from the law firm of Bob DuPuy, baseball's president.
