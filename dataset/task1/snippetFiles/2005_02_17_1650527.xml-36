	The week before the Wyoming event, Major Zeegers and Sgt. First Class Doug Davidson, another Special Forces soldier, spent a few days reviewing the game team's latest efforts. When they weren't encased in motion capture suits to record the latest urban assault techniques, they reviewed the game's latest mission assignment documents to ensure that they conformed with Army argot. When they were not recording video clips that will be used to explain various Special Forces roles to the game's players, they were engaging in arcane exchanges with the developers about the latest Army hardware. ''In the next-generation version of the game we're going to have the new 249,'' Mr. Aubuchon said to Sergeant Davidson, referring to a type of machine gun. ''And it will have the new Picatinny Rail on top, but do you know if that uses the ACOG?'' ACOG is the Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight, but it is apparently not best suited for the 249. ''Well, the ACOG is used mostly on the M4, not on the 249,'' Sergeant Davidson replied. ''On the 249 you would normally use an M145,'' another kind of gun sight.
