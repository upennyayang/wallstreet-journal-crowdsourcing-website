	The definition of ''impairment,'' however, remains vague. And many clinicians chafe at the manual's rigid diagnostic criteria.
	''Say the diagnostic category for a depressive disorder is four out of eight symptoms, and you have two,'' said Dr. John Ratey, a Harvard University psychiatrist. ''What are you, just miserable?''
	For patients, being given a name and a biological basis for their difficulties represents a shift from a ''moral diagnosis'' that centers on shame, to a medical one, said Dr. Ratey, who is the author of ''Shadow Syndromes,'' which argues that virtually all people have brain differences they need to be aware of to help guide them through life.
	But the most humane approach, some experts argue, may lie in redefining the expanding set of syndromes as differences rather than diagnoses.
	''We're doing a service on the one hand by describing many more of these conditions and inviting people to understand themselves better,'' said Dr. Edward Hallowell, a leading authority on A.D.D. ''But when we pathologize it we scare them and make them not want to have any part of it. I think of these as traits, not disorders.''
