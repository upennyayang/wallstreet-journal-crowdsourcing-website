	Her interest in genetics was spurred by a young student with such scant interest in science that she would drop biology and chemistry courses in order to take more religion classes. The student, Sharon Terry, was so taken by Sister Deignan that after graduating from a Catholic high school in Waterbury, Conn., where Sister Deignan was teaching, she decided she wanted to become a nun. Life and love eventually forced a shift in plans, but Mrs. Terry, now 47, remained a lay member of Sister Deignan's order and went to work as a college chaplain in Worcester, Mass.
	About 10 years ago, Mrs. Terry took her two young children, a boy and a girl, to a doctor, concerned that a rash they both had never seemed to go away. The rash turned out to be a symptom of a rare genetic disease, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, that can lead to blindness and, in some cases, fatal heart and intestinal problems.
	When Mrs. Terry told Sister Deignan about the diagnosis, Sister Deignan said she was so shaken that she felt physical pain. After a moment, though, Sister Deignan told Mrs. Terry that ''we must do anything we can to find a cure.''
