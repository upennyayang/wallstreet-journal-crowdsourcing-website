	''Fifty years ago, warnings on cigarette packages said smoking may be dangerous to your health,'' said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who with Representative Ginny Brown-Waite, Republican of Florida, has introduced a bill asking the Food and Drug Administration to consider making warning labels on tanning beds more prominent and strident.
	''Now cigarette packs say smoking causes cancer,'' Ms. Maloney said. ''We don't want to wait another 50 years to have labels that adequately warn people that tanning beds cause cancer.''
	But John Overstreet, executive director of the Indoor Tanning Association, said the agency is adequately regulating the industry, and Ms. Maloney's bill is unnecessary.
	Many people who regularly visit tanning salons choose to set limits on their exposure, rather than eliminate it.
	Kristyn DeAngelo, 23, who graduated last week from Parsons School of Design, said she visits City Sun five days a week. She said she believes she's protected, as long as she does not get sunburned, and so prefers newer tanning machines that emit lower levels of UVB light. Even so, she said, she covers her face with a towel to avoid tanning because she does not want wrinkles.
