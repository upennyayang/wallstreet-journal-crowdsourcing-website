	Since there is water vapor in the atmosphere, scientists expect to find some water ice in the soil. The mechanical arm is to scoop up soil samples and place them in ovens for analysis by instruments designed by the University of Arizona. The electric ovens will heat the samples to see what gases are released. By measuring the amount of water vapor and carbon dioxide gas, scientists will be able to determine the amount of ice beneath the surface, as well as minerals that may have formed when Mars had a warmer climate. Eight samples are expected to be examined during the mission.
	''Everything we know about life says that water is an essential part of it,'' said Dr. William V. Boynton, a University of Arizona planetary scientist who developed the instruments for testing the soil. ''If Mars was always as dry as it appears now to be, then it's not very likely life could have ever gotten started. But if there really were oceans on Mars at one time, that's exciting.''
	The craft is also carrying two probes, each the size of a basketball, for penetrating even deeper, perhaps more than three feet.
