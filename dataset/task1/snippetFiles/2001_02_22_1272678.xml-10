	''The fact that the order says the Department of Health will notify hospitals where he worked falls way short of permitting the state to violate his rights under the confidentiality statutes,'' he said.
	The lawsuit also accuses Dr. Novello of interfering with Dr. Arbit's right to make a living, and seeks roughly $1 million in damages on that charge alone.
	Although cleared of most of the recent charges, Dr. Arbit was found to be grossly negligent -- the highest level of misconduct -- in his care of one of the 11 patients. He was found to have operated on the wrong disks of the patient's spine, which the hearing committee concluded was ''no different in substance or egregiousness to operating on the wrong limb,'' according to state records.
	Five years earlier, he lost his post as chief of neurosurgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan after he was accused of operating on the wrong side of another patient's brain.
	But Dr. Arbit always insisted that the recent set of charges were cooked up by a jealous doctor whom he replaced as chief of neurosurgery at Staten Island University Hospital, a claim repeated in his lawsuit.
