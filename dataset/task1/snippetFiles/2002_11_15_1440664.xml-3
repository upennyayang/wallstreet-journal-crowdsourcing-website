	The show was produced by the museum in collaboration with the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, which Einstein helped found and which owns most of Einstein's papers and artifacts, and with help from the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles. It will tour the United States before landing in Jerusalem in 2005.
	For those who think of Einstein mainly as the wild-haired geek responsible for mind-bending and obscure pronouncements about space, time and the universe, the exhibition is likely to be an eye-opener. It is chockablock with letters, photographs and artifacts, which include porcelain teacups illustrated with his and his sister Maja's baby pictures, and some of his sheet music -- ''I live my daydreams in music,'' Einstein said. These document in illuminating detail his romantic and political lives as well as his scientific one. Many of these are things rarely seen even by Einstein aficionados. Part of the show consists of letters in his own pointy little handwriting, which have rarely, if ever, been seen outside the Jerusalem archives where they reside. There is grit as well as glory: the certificate exempting Einstein from Swiss military service because of his flat feet and the notepad on which he was inscribing delicate ethereal equations when he died.
