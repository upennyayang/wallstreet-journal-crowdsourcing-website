	In 1979, Dr. Abdus Salam, a physicist from Pakistan, and Dr. Sheldon L. Glashow, a classmate of Dr. Weinberg at the Bronx High School of Science, shared the Nobel Prize for the work.
	The core of the electroweak theory went on to inspire a successful and experimentally verified theory of the strong force, which holds atomic nuclei together. The results were bundled together in what physicists call the Standard Model, a theory that includes all the known forces except gravity and amounts to a particle physicist's bible.
	Dr. Edward Witten, a physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study, described the theoretical innovations at the heart of the electroweak theory as ''the main lessons of elementary particle physics in the last half century.''
	Beyond his many research papers, Dr. Weinberg has also made a mark with writings that include scientific monographs like ''Gravitation and Cosmology'' and ''The Quantum Theory of Fields,'' popular books like ''Dreams of a Final Theory'' and ''The First Three Minutes: A Modern View of the Origin of the Universe'' and articles and essays on culture and science in publications like The New York Review of Books, Scientific American and George magazine.
