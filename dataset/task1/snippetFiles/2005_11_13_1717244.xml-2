	According to the NPD Group, a research firm, 18 percent of wireless telephone subscribers in the United States -- many of them tech-wise teenagers -- download ring tones, at an average cost of $2.32 a pop. Informa, a British research and analysis firm, forecasts that ring tones will grow to a $6.8 billion global business in 2010 from nearly $5 billion in 2005, with the North American business growing to $1.5 billion from $510 million. Who knew?
	Now, it seems, every media business is in search of its variation on the ring-tone premise. Last week, we learned that both Google and Amazon.com were working on services that would allow readers to buy electronic versions of books, either by the page or by the chapter.
	In one respect, this sounds like very much a back-to-the-future concept, harking back to the days when Dickens's work first appeared in serial form. But, really, it's probably less about reading the latest ''Harry Potter'' installment a bit at a time than it is about parceling out passages and chapters of books for how-to or research purposes.
