	Many could remember the planning meetings for the telescope 20 years ago. Now some are gray, with potbellies, making jokes about their blood pressure and carrying pictures of grandchildren. Meanwhile, the end may be near for the telescope that has defined their era. ''This is a particularly poignant time in Hubble's history,'' Dr. Steven Beckwith, the telescope institute's director, told the astronomers. Launched into orbit in 1990, Hubble has dominated astronomy, beaming back crystalline images of the cosmos unsullied by atmospheric haze or turbulence. Astronomers say it is still at the peak of its powers. But in January NASA's administrator, Sean O'Keefe, citing safety concerns, canceled a mission scheduled for next year that would have sent astronauts on the shuttle to install two new instruments on the telescope and change its gyroscopes and batteries. Without maintenance visits like this, the telescope will probably die within three years. Mr. O'Keefe's decision provoked outcries from scientists, the public and Capitol Hill. Last month the National Research Council appointed a committee of scientists and engineers, led by Dr. Louis J. Lanzerotti of Bell Laboratories, to assess the relative risks and rewards of further Hubble servicing missions.
