	She settled for watching the animals from a distance with binoculars. She said she always wore the same clothes and kept to the same routine, never making an approach that might seem threatening. After a few months, her patience was rewarded. An older male, whom she named David Greybeard, ventured toward her.
	''I held out a banana, and he kept getting closer and closer,'' she said. ''He was my link to the others, getting me through the door to their world.''
	Soon, Dr. Goodall saw David Greybeard and other chimps breaking and modifying sticks for ''fishing'' termites and ants from their nests. Humans, it seemed, were not the only toolmakers. She also observed chimps going off on hunting trips, revealing that they were not totally vegetarians and fruit eaters. She also discovered their violent sides.
	''Chimpanzees are like us in so many ways,'' Dr. Goodall said.
	She is now 73, her blond hair turned gray, though she still ties it in the back as she did in her Gombe years. She is slender and smiles a lot with her eyes, recognizably the woman in the old pictures, the one standing in deepest Africa with a chimp at her feet, reaching up to lift the tail of her khaki shirt.
