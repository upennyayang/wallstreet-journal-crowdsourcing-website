	Their courageousness can be explained by the fact that colobus monkeys live in multimale, multifemale groups in which the males are almost always related. So in protecting the young monkeys, the adult males are defending their kin.
	Yet, as biologists are learning, there is more to cooperation and generosity than an investment in one's nepotistic patch of DNA. Lately, they have accrued evidence that something like group selection encourages the evolution of traits beneficial to a group, even when members of the group are not related.
	In computer simulation studies, Dr. Smuts and her colleagues modeled two types of group-living agents that would behave like herbivores: one that would selfishly consume all the food in a given patch before moving on, and another that would consume resources modestly rather than greedily, thus allowing local plant food to regenerate.
	Researchers had assumed that cooperators could collaborate with genetically unrelated cooperators only if they had the cognitive capacity to know goodness when they saw it.
	But the data suggested otherwise. ''These models showed that under a wide range of simulated environmental conditions you could get selection for prudent, cooperative behavior,'' Dr. Smuts said, even in the absence of cognition or kinship.
