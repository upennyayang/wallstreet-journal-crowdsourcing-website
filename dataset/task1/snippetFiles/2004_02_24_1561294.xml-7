	When the women were shocked, brain scans picked up the activation of a vast pain network spread throughout the brain. Several regions showed activity, including the somatosensory cortex, where touch is perceived, and the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, two areas that help control the emotional experience of pain.
	When a woman watched her partner being stung, the sensory cortex was quiet. But emotional centers sprang into action, indicating that she was reliving the experience without the physical stimulus or sensation.
	''It's rather surprising that we tune into the experiences of others so quickly and with an emotional response, not just with a cognitive perspective,'' said Dr. Tania Singer, a research fellow at the University College London and the lead author of the paper. ''The fact is that we really do put ourselves in another person's emotional shoes. It's automatic.''
	Dr. Marco Iacoboni, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved with the shock experiment, said the finding did not surprise him. In an experiment last year, Dr. Iacoboni asked people to observe different facial expressions and, in some cases, to imitate them.
