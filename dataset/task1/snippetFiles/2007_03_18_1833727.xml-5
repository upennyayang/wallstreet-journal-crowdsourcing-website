	Greg Zerzan Washington null Henig's article offers broad coverage of some of the major scientific efforts to explain why the majority of Americans believe in God, but it omitted a significant line of thought: gestalt psychology, which postulates that we are hard-wired to accept explanations of events that best fit their elements into a coherent, dynamically functional, sense-making organization: e.g., the tiles of a jigsaw puzzle make no sense until they are combined into a whole that has meaning for the viewer. To the extent that our primitive ancestors were able to make sense out of the stimuli from their surroundings, they were able to survive the dangers of their world. But the less they knew of the true causes of what went on around them, the more they needed to ''make sense'' by ascribing them to supernatural forces. It follows, then, that the more rationally advanced and informed a civilization becomes, the less likely its members are to accept on faith rather than reason -- as we see in modern Europe, where religious observance has steadily declined since its dominance in earlier centuries.
