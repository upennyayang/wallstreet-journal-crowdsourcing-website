	Ancient Spider Blood
	About 20 million years ago, a spider in what is now the Dominican Republic had a very bad day. It was climbing a tree when it was hit by a flow of resin coming from the opposite direction. The substance tore off some of the spider's legs and quickly engulfed it.
	The resin fossilized into amber, preserving the spider, and now a scientist examining the amber has discovered that it contains several drops of blood. It's the first spider blood, or hemolymph, found in amber.
	The scientist, David Penney of the University of Manchester in England, was able to determine much about the last moments of the spider, a previously unknown species in the family Filistatidae, a common one in the Caribbean.
	The spider lost four of its eight legs, and two of them are preserved nearby. This indicates that the spider did not walk onto a sticky patch, get stuck and become entombed by resin later. Rather, it was hit by a fast-moving stream of resin of relatively low viscosity. The findings were published in the journal Paleontology.
	When a spider's leg is detached in this way, some blood seeps out of what remains of the appendage.
