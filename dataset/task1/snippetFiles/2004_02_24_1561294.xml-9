	''It's rather surprising that we tune into the experiences of others so quickly and with an emotional response, not just with a cognitive perspective,'' said Dr. Tania Singer, a research fellow at the University College London and the lead author of the paper. ''The fact is that we really do put ourselves in another person's emotional shoes. It's automatic.''
	Dr. Marco Iacoboni, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved with the shock experiment, said the finding did not surprise him. In an experiment last year, Dr. Iacoboni asked people to observe different facial expressions and, in some cases, to imitate them.
	''What we found was that those who actually imitated the expressions showed a boost in activity in emotional centers like the amygdala,'' Dr. Iacoboni said. ''The way we understand other people's feelings is by simulating in our brain the same activity we have when we experience those emotions.''
	The latest study points to the same underlying mechanism, Dr. Iacoboni said. But whether empathy is genetically programmed remains unclear, ''because the people the subjects showed empathy toward were loved ones, not strangers.''
