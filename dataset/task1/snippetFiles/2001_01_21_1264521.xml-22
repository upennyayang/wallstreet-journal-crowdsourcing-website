	At the STAR detector stop, John Harris, the leader of that detector group, was on hand to answer questions and greet visiting scientists. Like most of the RHIC physicists presenting their results, he hadn't slept much over the previous two weeks.
	''I am no longer considered young,'' the 50-year-old physicist said wryly. ''When I started here 10 years ago, I used to joke that I dyed my hair gray to get more respect. I don't have to do that anymore.''
	Next door, in the STAR ''counting house,'' where computers collect all the information passed on from the detector, 31-year-old Jens Berger flashed a picture on the computer screen that was the first sign that RHIC was working and that years of planning and building were finally over. Visitors leaned in to get a good view.
	''Last summer we waited day after day for 16 hours at a time,'' Dr. Berger said, ''and finally, on the 12th of June at nine in the evening -- I'll never, ever forget it -- we got the first collisions. Right now this is a great place to be, right here. It's pretty exciting.''
