	In the long since darkened green of the Polo Grounds, which the author brightly illuminates, we witness the unfolding of the plot against a backdrop of improbably mounting prowess (of the Giants' 28 home games remaining after the sign stealing began, they won 23). Still, it is neither the plot's audacity nor its revisionist implications -- if steroids are today prompting a cry for asterisks in the record books, how about this? one might ask -- that grip the reader. It is the corrosive effect of secrecy upon the scheme's two principal victims, one of them possibly a perpetrator.
	In the summer of 1951 Thomson had been one of the batters who liked to know what pitch was coming, but once Prager persuaded some Giants to break their code of silence, Thomson denied, in an exceedingly equivocal way, that he had benefited from advance knowledge of what pitch Branca would throw on that 0-1 count. Branca, on the other hand, who had worn the goat horns in silence all those years, though he learned of the plot in the mid-1950's, felt liberated at last to say that Thomson went after the high fastball ''like a tiger pouncing on some wounded antelope.''
