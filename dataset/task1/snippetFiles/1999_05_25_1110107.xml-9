	A team of researchers using a NASA infrared telescope in Hawaii has now reported the existence of these electrojets, by measuring the shifting wavelengths of molecular hydrogen (the shifts being an indication that the ions are moving). The researchers, writing in the journal Nature, reported that the average speed of the ions was 2.8 kilometers per second, or more than 6,000 miles an hour.
	The researchers note that friction between these winds and the rest of Jupiter's atmosphere may help explain why the temperature of the upper atmosphere is several hundred degrees higher than would be explained by the effects of sunlight alone.
	Stormy Weather on Mars
	There has been some violent weather on Mars, too -- a huge mid-summer cyclonic storm near the North Pole.
	The storm was photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope on April 27, when Mars was in a close approach to Earth, 54 million miles away. The storm system, four times the size of Texas, resembled a hurricane, with spiral water-ice clouds and an eye.
	Most Martian storms are of the dust variety; moisture-laden storms have rarely been observed, and the ones that had been seen, notably during a Viking mission two decades ago, were much smaller.
