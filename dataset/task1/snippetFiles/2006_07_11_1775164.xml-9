	In the middle of the video a woman (scientific reports have specified the gender of the hidden human) in a gorilla suit walks calmly through the group, stops briefly to pound her chest -- although not in a very noticeable way -- and then continues walking out of the video frame.
	Not a summer blockbuster, but then the viewers are usually volunteers who are paid to participate in an experiment, as in the recent study ''Blind Drunk: The Effects of Alcohol on Inattentional Blindness,'' reported in the current issue of the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology.
	Seema L. Clifasefi at the University of Washington and colleagues recruited 46 people to participate in an experiment in surroundings that, by themselves, challenged traditional notions of reality.
	Dr. Clifasefi writes, ''After the individual screening, subjects assembled in the Behavioral Alcohol Research Lab (Barlab) at the University of Washington: a room in the psychology department designed to simulate a cocktail lounge.''
	The subjects relax at the Barlab and chat among themselves.
	''Can I buy you a placebo?''
	''Say, didn't we meet in the Stanford Prison Experiment?''
	They consume what may or may not be alcohol. They are told what they are drinking, but sometimes they are told the truth and sometimes not.
