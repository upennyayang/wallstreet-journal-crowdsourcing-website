	Hormone therapies were originally approved to treat the symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes and night sweats, a purpose for which they are unquestionably effective. But many women take them for years to enhance a feeling of well-being or in the belief they can help prevent some of the ailments of old age. But the federal study that has now been halted, a rigorously controlled trial involving more than 16,000 healthy women, has made it clear that prolonged use can be somewhat risky. The estrogen-progestin combination caused a slight increase in breast cancer, heart attacks, strokes and blood clots, with the heart attack risk starting in the first year of treatment. This damage outweighed a small beneficial effect in reducing hip fractures and colon cancers.
	No woman need panic over these findings. The scientific directors of the study stress that the drugs increased a woman's risk of contracting breast cancer -- the finding of most concern -- by less than a tenth of a percent per year, a tiny amount. But if the drugs are taken by millions of women over several years, the risk translates into tens of thousands of cases of breast cancer or cardiovascular disease, a clear public health concern.
