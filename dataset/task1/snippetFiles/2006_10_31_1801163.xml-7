	''There have been a couple of very big events in geological history where the carbon cycle changed dramatically,'' said Scott Doney, senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. One was an abrupt warming that took place 55 million years ago in conjunction with acidification of the oceans and mass extinctions. Most scientists don't believe we're headed toward a man-made variant on that episode -- not yet, at any rate. But many worry that we're hurtling into unknown dangers.
	''Whether in 20 years or 100 years, I think marine ecosystems are going to be dramatically different by the end of this century, and that'll lead to extinction events,'' Mr. Doney added.
	''This is the only habitable planet we have,'' he said. ''The damage we do is going to be felt by all the generations to come.''
	So that should be one of the great political issues for this century -- the vandalism we're committing to our planet because of our refusal to curb greenhouse gases. Yet the subject is barely debated in this campaign.
	Changes in ocean chemistry are only one among many damaging consequences of carbon emissions.
