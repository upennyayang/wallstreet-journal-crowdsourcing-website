	Rodriguez forevermore will be known not by his uniform number, 3, but by 252. His new teammates, however, say the contract has not affected them.
	''No one has said anything about his money, not one,'' Rafael Palmeiro said. ''He makes a lot of money and deservedly. We just want him to play well and help us win, regardless of how much money he makes.''
	When the Mets ended negotiations for Rodriguez before they started, their general manager, Steve Phillips, talked about his concern that Rodriguez would create a 24-and-1 clubhouse scenario. The Rangers haven't found that.
	''Not only is he one of the top two or three players in the game on the field,'' Rusty Greer said, ''but from what I know about Alex Rodriguez in the short time I've been around him, he's a good person and a good guy in the clubhouse. For me that's almost as important as doing a good job on the field. He has fit very well into the team concept and into the chemistry of the team. He has been every bit the leader that we saw on the other side of the field the past few years.''
