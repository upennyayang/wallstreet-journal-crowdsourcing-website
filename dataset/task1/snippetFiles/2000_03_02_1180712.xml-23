	''The incremental impact is probably so small it doesn't make any difference,'' said Robert A. Baade, an economist at Lake Forest College in Illinois who is an expert in sports franchises. ''We're talking about a neighborhood team. I doubt very much that with all the entertainment options in New York, you'll see people traveling from other boroughs to see a minor league team. ''Rather than utilizing fewer facilities more often, you're building more facilities and using them less often. It's the opposite of sound economics.'' In what is the city's best deal with professional sports, the United States Tennis Association built a $234 million stadium and 15 new tennis courts, albeit with $150 million in tax-exempt bonds, at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens. The complex, which is open to the public 300 days a year, paid $6.4 million in rent and fees to city over 10 years ending in 1998, the last year for which figures are available. There is little question that the waterfront in Coney Island could use Mr. Carey's shot in the arm. And Mayor Giuliani has gone to great lengths to put a minor league club there.
