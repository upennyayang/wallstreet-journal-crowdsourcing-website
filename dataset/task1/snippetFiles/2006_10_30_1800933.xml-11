	By comparison, the world is currently spending just over $1 trillion a year, or about 2.5 percent of global gross global domestic product, on defense, according to a yearly survey by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. (Military spending in the United States is about 3.7 percent of gross domestic product.) ''This confirms what we've seen for a long time,'' said Kert Davies, a climate-policy coordinator for Greenpeace. ''The longer we take to act, the greater the costs will be.'' Jerry Taylor, an expert on energy and climate policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group in Washington, said the wide range of cost estimates for cutting emissions ''basically tells you we're guessing.'' Overall, he said, he put more faith in academic analyses than one produced at a government's request, particularly at a time when the public appears eager to see signs of action on the issue. The release of the 700-page report, which was 16 months in the making, will come one week before the start of the latest round of talks on the Kyoto Protocol, the first international pact requiring cuts in heat-trapping emissions.
