	When Stephen Hawking startled cosmologists by asserting that energy and matter could leak out of black holes, his calculations did not say how particles escaped from the black hole, only that they could. The only truth is in the mathematics, he says.
	According to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, a pillar of quantum theory, the so-called vacuum of space is not empty but rather foaming with virtual particles that flash into existence in particle-antiparticle pairs on borrowed energy and then meet and annihilate each other in a flash of energy that repays the debt of their existence.
	But if only one member of a pair fell into a black hole, its mate would be free to wander away. To a distant observer it would appear to be coming out of the black hole, and, since the energy for its creation had been borrowed from the black hole's gravitational field and then not been paid back, the black hole would accordingly appear to shrink.
	As the black hole shrank it would get hotter and radiate faster, according to Dr. Hawking's calculations, until it finally exploded.
	The mortality of a black hole was of little practical concern.
