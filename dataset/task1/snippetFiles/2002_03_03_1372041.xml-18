	''Science Fictions'' has one significant flaw. Crewdson was apparently determined to let the facts speak for themselves -- and they do, particularly as summarized in a timeline at the beginning of the book. But Crewdson's narrative would have benefited if he had stepped back more often from the minutiae of his case to provide perspective and analysis. He faults American officials, scientists and journalists for helping Gallo to perpetuate his ''fictions.'' But Crewdson's narrative is so complex -- crammed with such an array of human and viral characters -- that readers may sympathize with those who hesitated to condemn Gallo. On the last page, Crewdson says only Gallo can answer ''the most compelling question'' raised by this story: ''Had he somehow convinced himself that all the lies were true? Or had he known better all along?'' I wish Crewdson had tried harder to arrive at an answer, perhaps by providing more analysis of Gallo's personality. At various points he quotes sources suggesting that Gallo was mentally disturbed. Crewdson, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1981 as a reporter for The New York Times, should have made some effort to evaluate these innuendoes rather than simply repeating them.
