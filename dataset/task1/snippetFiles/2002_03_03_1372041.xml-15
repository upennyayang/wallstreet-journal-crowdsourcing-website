	In 1989, however, the National Institutes of Health started looking into Crewdson's assertion in his newspaper that Gallo's ''discovery'' was ''either an accident or a theft.'' Over the next three years, different committees of the institute accused both Gallo and Popovic of scientific misconduct. The charges were dropped in November 1993 because of pressure from high-ranking government officials, according to Crewdson. He says American officials had a financial motive for backing Gallo: by the end of 1986, his blood test was making $4 million a year in royalties for the Department of Health and Human Services.
	On July 11, 1994, that department finally acknowledged that ''a virus provided by the Institut Pasteur was used by National Institutes of Health scientists who invented the American H.I.V. test kit in 1984.'' It promised the French $6 million in restitution. That is as close as the United States has come to an apology for its decade-long defense of Gallo. That year Gallo left the National Institutes of Health for a position at the University of Maryland, but he continued to receive $100,000 annually in royalties for his patented blood test.
