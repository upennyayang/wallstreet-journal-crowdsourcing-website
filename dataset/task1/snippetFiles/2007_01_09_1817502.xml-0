	In an era of academic hyper-specialization, Dr. Nina G. Jablonski has an amazingly broad résumé. At 53, she heads the anthropology department at Pennsylvania State University. She's also a primatologist, an evolutionary biologist and a paleontologist.
	Last year, Dr. Jablonski led an expedition to China, where she dug for human fossils in an attempt to learn how early man coped with climate change. This month, she's in Kenya, where she and Meave Leakey are putting together a study on prehistoric monkeys.
	For more than a decade, Dr. Jablonski has been trying to get her arms around a ubiquitous and yet mysterious topic: the biology, evolution and social function of human skin. The results of her studies have been published by the University of California Press as ''Skin: A Natural History.''
	''Skin has been studied to absolute death by dermatologists,'' Dr. Jablonski said jokingly during a recent visit to New York City. ''They know it inside and out from the point of view of diseases that afflict it. What we wanted to learn was how human skin came to be as it is and what that meant for humanity.''
