	Another question is whether the system, if it does work, will prove superior to more mundane methods like voice recognition or even Dr. Wolpaw's electroencephalography system.
	Cyberkinetics said it expected that its system would be faster than other methods, perhaps allowing people to type 20 to 30 words a minute, as fast as a healthy person could type on a BlackBerry hand-held computer.
	Marcie Roth, executive director of the National Spinal Cord Injury Association, said the needs of paralyzed people varied. A system like BrainGate ''could be fantastically useful for some people,'' she said.
	Cyberkinetics said that it did not intend to sell the current version of BrainGate, but that it hoped eventually to offer an improved model. It would use miniaturized electronics and would be fully implanted in the brain, transmitting information without wires. The price is likely to be in the tens of thousands of dollars, the company said.
	Eventually, the system may come in a form that does not have to be calibrated by technicians each time it is turned on. It would always be ready to use, as if it were a part of the body.
