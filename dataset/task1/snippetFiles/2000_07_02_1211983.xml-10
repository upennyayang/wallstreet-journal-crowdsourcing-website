	''At each of our public agenda meetings, a group of parents would come to testify because their children were getting poor educations,'' Ms. Thomson said. ''Some were being taught through sign language interpreters who were not teachers, and the quality was poor. We heard from students who told of failing tests. Many said they felt isolated going to school, walking around with sign language interpreters. What they cried out for was a program where they could be taught in their home language -- A.S.L.'' Dr. Florsheim, the first deaf principal of the school, has mostly hired teachers fluent in sign language to his staff of 87 since becoming principal in 1996. The school, which is on East 23rd Street at Second Avenue in Manhattan, has about 300 students. American Sign Language is an important touchstone to the deaf. It had been banned from schools for more than a century in an effort to make deaf students learn and behave more like hearing children. In the late 1960's, William Stokoe Jr., a linguist at Gallaudet University, a university for the hearing-impaired in Washington, pushed for it to become recognized as a language.
