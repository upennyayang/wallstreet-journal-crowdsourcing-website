	Under the steps recommended by Ms. Albright, the American embargo against Cuba, imposed 37 years ago, would remain in effect. So would more restrictions added after the pilots were shot down. Individually, some of the changes would be incremental expansions of existing policies on private relief aid to Cuban citizens. Taken together they represent a consensus among top officials that, since the 40-year-old reign of Fidel Castro is likely to end soon, the United States must ''promote a peaceful democratic transition'' by injecting American money, culture and ideas into the isolated island. ''We are doing what we can to expand the space'' in which Cuban citizens can breathe more freely, the official said. The measures endorsed by Ms. Albright can be undertaken by Presidential order, without Congressional approval. Senator John Warner, a Virginia Republican, said he was ''concerned that these efforts fall way short'' of what could have been accomplished by a national commission he proposed to revise American policy toward Cuba. Ms. Albright recommended that no such commission be formed, saying it could never resolve the question of the economic embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba in 1962.
