	''Wayside Shrine,'' painted on cardboard and measuring a mere 8 7/8 by 7 1/2 inches, was expected to sell for $45,000 to $60,000, according to estimates in the Dorotheum's catalog. Today the auction house removed the picture from its online catalog (dorotheum.com).
	Mr. Korte said at least one Schiele painting from Dr. Rieger's collection was now in the Kamm Museum in Zug, Switzerland. Schiele paintings from the collection also include ''Harbor of Trieste,'' a 1907 oil in the Joanneum museum in Graz, Austria, and ''Meadow With Village in Background (II)'' in the Austrian Gallery in Vienna.
	The case's outcome may also pose a serious problem for the Dorotheum. ''Vienna is still considered a safe harbor for Aryanized art because you have Roman law,'' Mr. Templ said. ''If you sell an Aryanized painting in New York or London, the buyer will immediately lose it.''
	The Dorotheum admits that the painting passed directly from Dr. Rieger's collection to Friedrich Welz, citing a catalog of Schiele's work prepared by Jane Kallir, owner of the Galerie St. Ã‰tienne in Manhattan. Then it was bought by William Lincer, former first violist with the New York Philharmonic, who apparently knew nothing of the painting's history.
