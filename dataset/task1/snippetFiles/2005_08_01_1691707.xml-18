	Since then he has served as deputy for technology at the Strategic Defense Initiative, the antimissile system close to the hearts of many in the Bush administration, and as the head of a technology venture capital fund, In-Q-Tel, which was set up in 1999 by the Central Intelligence Agency.
	But unlike Sean O'Keefe, his predecessor as the head of NASA and a disciple of Vice President Dick Cheney, Dr. Griffin is known for his engineering prowess, not his political acumen or his skill with budgets. At moments he is strikingly direct, saying several times in the past week that the decision not to deal with the risk of foam breaking off at the spot where it did from the Discovery's liquid fuel tank ''was clearly wrong.''
	Mr. O'Keefe was the smoothest of political operators, known for his ability to navigate the back corners of the executive branch and rationalize the agency's budget. But technology, he freely acknowledged, was not his forte. Dr. Griffin, in contrast, is the author of a textbook called ''Space Vehicle Design,'' and he makes no effort to hide his distaste for the creaky, aging shuttle.
