	Once you are comfortable with the controls, however, the Virtual Safari interface is nifty. On the map of Camp Mara, for example, there is a red ring where the airplane is parked. Several more rings are spaced along the track to your tent. As you progress along the trail, each ring or ''node'' turns red, offering a 360-degree, three-dimensional photograph of your surroundings -- and by holding down the left mouse button, you can search for animals while turning in a complete circle. You are able to zoom into the picture, look up at the sky or look down toward your feet. If there is an animal nearby, you will hear its sounds -- the grunting of a warthog, the roar of a lion -- and the cursor will turn into a box. A mouse click will open a video -- some of them are as short as five seconds -- with a brief caption, like ''The caracal can jump up and snatch a bird right out of the air.''
	And when you reach the last ring, your tent, you can push through the flap and move around inside, where there is a laptop computer on the desk ready to connect to the Nature Web site.
