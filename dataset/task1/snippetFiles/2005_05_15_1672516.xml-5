	Phobia, which means ''fear of,'' was doing fine as a medical term until recently. ''Phobias are irrational fears,'' says Elaine Rodino, a psychologist in Santa Monica, Calif. ''They are not just 'sort of fears'; they are full and intense and uncontrollable.'' An anxiety psychologist in Chicago, David Carbonell, says that ''the clinical term phobia is not doing well. Often it's appended to another word to indicate a wide range of dislikes that may have nothing to do with the core meaning of avoidance as a response to powerful fear. I just fielded a request for an interview on 'nudophobia.'''
	These range from Islamophobe to Christophobe, both of which were used in the Oct. 23, 1997, edition of The Independent in London. They include Dean-o-phobe in a 2003 New Republic article, when Jonathan Chait confessed, ''It's not entirely clear to me why I've taken such an intense dislike to Howard Dean.''
	Today's negative connotation of the suffix -phobia (the ailment) or -phobe (the person) comes from the political-social accusation of homophobia. The original meaning, according to the O.E.D., is ''fear of men, or aversion towards the male sex.''
