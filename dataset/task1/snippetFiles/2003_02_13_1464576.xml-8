	SENATOR SNOWE: But wasn't this piece of debris the largest documented piece ever to hit the shuttle? A. Not to my knowledge, but I will correct that for the record, if that proves to be in error. I don't know whether that's true or not, but I certainly will provide that for the record. . . . SENATOR NELSON: Prior to you arriving at NASA, a space shuttle budget was whacked by some $1.4 billion. Basically, part of that over a nine-year period this is -- and by the way, it's not the easiest to find this out because prior to your arrival back in the early 90's, everything was lumped in together into a human spaceflight account. The space shuttle, the kinds of new technologies plus the station. But when you break it out what you find is that the Congress whacked part of it, about $600 million out of the space shuttle. And then NASA itself whacked another $750. Putting those two together you can see the years. And this is prior to you arriving in '02. That year the Congress had added some $45 million and NASA had whacked $70 million to the space shuttle.
