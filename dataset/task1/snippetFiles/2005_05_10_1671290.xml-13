	Q. Don't animals have culture? A. Not in the sense that they have traditions that change as they are transmitted. O.K., chimpanzees in one forest in Africa use short sticks to fish for ants. In another, they use longer ones. Yes, this seems to be socially transmitted. But what doesn't happen is an accumulation of knowledge. What they don't get is something that gets better and better through time. In human cultures, things change with each generation. Populations create things that are useful in their survival and these things evolve and get better so that people can flourish. No single individual could have created something as complex and functional as the kayak. Q. There are biologists who think that a lot of our behavior is hard-wired into our genes. Do you? A. I don't think anything is hard-wired. Even the number of fingers on your hands isn't hard-wired. Even the genes that get expressed as your limbs develop depending on environmental circumstances. The thalidomide babies of the 1950's know that rather directly. Q. There was a time when anthropologists went off to New Guinea and observed how the local people lived.
