	Now it is about what cannot be seen. In the last few decades astronomers have had to confront the possibility that stars and galaxies -- not to mention the creatures that inhabit them -- are barely more than flecks of froth on a stormy sea of dark matter.
	Now Dr. Riess was presenting his colleagues with evidence, based on observations of a star that exploded 11 billion years ago, that the universe -- dark matter and all -- was being blown apart under the influence of a mysterious antigravitational force known only as ''dark energy.''
	''We are doing astronomy of the invisible,'' admitted Dr. Mario Livio, a theorist at the Space Telescope institute, who had organized the meeting, called ''The Dark Universe: Matter, Energy, and Gravity'' last fall.
	As it turned out, the meeting coincided with a NASA news conference announcing the breakthrough discovery by Dr. Riess and his colleagues and thus was dominated by discussions of new telescopes in space and new dimensions in the universe as astronomers grappled with the meaning of dark energy and how to take its measure.
	Now physicists, some of whom have been reluctant to take acceleration of the universe seriously, will have to explain what this dark energy is.
