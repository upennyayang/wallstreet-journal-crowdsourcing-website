	The evolution of democracy in Morocco has been hesitant, sometimes even illusory. For example, the legislative elections last September were more transparent than in the past, but recent investigations in the press here have raised serious questions about their fairness. We are also burdened by a constitution that does not meet the first criterion of a democratic constitution: the separation of powers. The monarchy has all the power, so much so that the Parliament plays a marginal role in political life. The true power is in the hands of the people close to King Mohammed VI. The relative powerlessness of elected institutions has resulted in the rejection of the political system by a large part of the Moroccan people, a rejection Islamic fundamentalists have exploited to recruit militants. Paradoxically, this antidemocratic system is supported by a political intelligentsia that calls itself democratic, even progressive. Indeed, the concentration of powers in the monarchy is considered a defense against fundamentalism. We have to delay democracy in order to save it from those who would use it to kill it, the intelligentsia say. We rely on the enlightened despot to preserve our future.
