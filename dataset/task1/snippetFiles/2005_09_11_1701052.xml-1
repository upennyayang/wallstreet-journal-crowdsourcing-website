	Though the Reagan ''evil empire'' rhetoric presaged a break from that bipolar era, policymakers remained reluctant to rock the diplomatic boat. Realism reached its peak in 1991 when President George H. W. Bush warned independence-minded Ukrainians not to separate from the Soviet Union lest they engage in ''suicidal nationalism.'' (A hard-line vituperator labeled that his ''Chicken Kiev'' speech, and the elder Bush never spoke to me again.)
	Then, four years ago today, came the attacks of 9/11, the Pearl Harbor of the war on terror. Soon after, a national-security policy incorporating Woodrow Wilson's idealism -- of ''making the world safe for democracy'' -- took hold. Led by hawkish neoconservatives determined to overthrow the Taliban and Saddam Hussein, the muscular approach to extending democracy shouldered aside the vocabulary of realism that had dominated U.S. foreign policy for decades in the cold war.
	But now that the insurgency in Iraq has turned an initial ''shock and awe'' campaign into what Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld acknowledged to be ''a long, hard slog,'' many in the national-security field are reasserting their criticism of the audacious Wilsonian ideal. In their language choices, however, the critics are not making the mistake of repeating denunciations of this Bush administration's unilateralism.
