	When patients looked through goggles, they reported very definite feelings, depending on which side of the brain was being engaged, Dr. Schiffer said. Some felt negative symptoms like anxiety and sadness when the right brain was activated. Others felt bad when the left brain was engaged. In general, he said, depressed patients felt worse when the right side was stimulated and people with post-traumatic stress syndrome fared poorly when the left side was more active.
	Dr. Schiffer speculates that in certain mental disorders, one hemisphere is less mature than the other. The immature side is the repository of past traumas and can come to dominate the healthy side. Thus each hemisphere has mental properties with some autonomy from the other side. Each can hold separate opinions, have a different sense of human and carry a different perspective on the world.
	Many people feel no mood difference when wearing the goggles, Dr. Schiffer said. This may be because both their hemispheres have similar outlooks, being equally calm or equally troubled.
	Dr. Schiffer uses the goggles in therapy sessions to help patients recognize their two minds and to help the mature side take control over the immature side.
