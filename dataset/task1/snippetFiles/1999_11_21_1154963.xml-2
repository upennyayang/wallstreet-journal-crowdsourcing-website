	It is also translated as comfortable inside his skin and is from the French etre bien dans sa peau. The meaning of the Gallic trope is ''at peace with oneself,'' or in current political terminology, ''the balanced, centered state of being that comes when the person is not in conflict with the persona.'' (To be inside someone else's skin, which never quite fits, is presumably uncomfortable.)
	Ms. Henneberger's recent use was to contrast the general acceptance of Mr. Bradley's skin-insidership with the news media brouhaha over the Gore campaign's retention, purportedly for image guidance, of Naomi Wolf. She is the author who once noted that she wrote in ''the first-person sexual,'' a singular locution. Because her employment was concealed, her guidance that Vice President Gore act more like an alpha male -- mentioned only in passing, she says -- was seized on by pundits eager to ridicule any potential manipulation of images.
	Alpha male, I am informed by Edward Lucaire of New York, is a coinage of Rudolph Schenkel, who studied dominance hierarchies among captive wolves (no kin to the Gore consultant) at the zoo in Basel, Switzerland, in the 1930's.
