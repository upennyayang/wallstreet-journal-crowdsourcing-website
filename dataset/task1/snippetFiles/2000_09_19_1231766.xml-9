	Researchers know exactly how and where this fear memory is hardwired in the rat's amygdala, a part of the brain that processes emotions. If the rat's amygdala is injected with a drug that blocks protein synthesis shortly after fear conditioning, it does not acquire long-term memory of the fear, Dr. Shafe said. But if the drug is injected six or more hours later, the memory is not blocked; the brain has made new proteins to consolidate and store the memory. For six hours or so the memory is what scientists term ''labile'' -- open or sensitive to some kind of manipulation. After this period, the memory is firmly in place. ''I was bored with these experiments,'' Dr. Nader said. ''I began thinking, what happens to a memory when you remember it? It would be so cool if it became labile again.'' He proposed a new experiment: animals would be trained to associate the tone with the electric shock. The researchers would wait a day or more for the fear memory to consolidate. Then they would present the animal with the tone (to retrieve the memory) and a drug that blocks protein synthesis.
