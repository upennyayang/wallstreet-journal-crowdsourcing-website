	A long apprenticeship was necessary before he could begin to parse that language. He did his Ph.D. thesis with Dr. Lester R. Drewes of the University of Minnesota, helping him conduct studies under a Defense Department grant on how the warfare agent sarin blocks the transmission of nervous signals.
	Receiving his Ph.D. in 1990, he was accepted as a postdoctoral student by Dr. Kandel's laboratory. There he worked on identifying genes that are active in rats' brains during memory formation. ''I got a more systematic education in neuroscience. I got to see how a big lab operates,'' Dr. Tsien said.
	He then moved to another leading neuroscience laboratory, that of Dr. Susumu Tonegawa at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Tonegawa won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1987 for research on the genetic control of the immune system, and later switched to the study of learning.
	In Dr. Tonegawa's lab, Dr. Tsien worked with so-called knock-out mice, animals from which a gene has been deleted. The idea is to learn what a gene does by excising it and seeing what defects the mouse develops.
