	The mythic ice scape that stretches south in all directions from the North Pole is melting so fast that Norwegian scientists say it could disappear entirely each summer beginning in just 50 years, radically altering the Earth's environment, the global economy and the human imagination.
	Climatologists have warned for a decade that the northern icecap is retreating. But researchers at the University of Bergen's Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center are apparently the first to predict the disorienting specter of a watery North Pole open to cruise ships and the Polar Bear Swim Club within the lives of today's young people.
	''The changes we've seen have been much faster and more dramatic than most people imagine,'' said Tore Furevik, 31, a polar researcher and co-author of the article ''Toward an Ice-Free Arctic?'' in the latest issue of the Norwegian science journal Cicerone.
	Not all ice specialists agree with Mr. Furevik, but his 50-year projection is supported by the director of the Bergen research center, Prof. Ola M. Johannessen, whose own study will appear in the fall issue of Science Progress, a British journal.
