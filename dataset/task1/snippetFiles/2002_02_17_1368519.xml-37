	''Pottery's one of the best tools for dating a site,'' Mr. Sinclair said. ''A piece from ancient Egypt is probably in just about as good a shape as a piece from yesterday. This piece was intact, a lovely little pitcher probably used for serving beer out of a keg.'' He describes it as a ''very standard sort of stylistic piece that fits into the latter half of the 1700's.''
	Elsewhere, the pitcher might prove he had found the Hussar. But this is Hell Gate, which in the 18th and 19th century, before it was effectively demolished, was one of the most treacherous bodies of water in the United States.
	''New York Harbor may be full of such pieces,'' Mr. Sinclair said. Dozens of pieces, from anchors to cannon, reputed to be from the Hussar have been brought up over the years. ''In investigating any sort of crash, you're looking at lots of little bits and pieces of evidence,'' Mr. Sinclair said, adding that much more must be assembled to draw any conclusions.
	The ship's age adds complications. ''Much of the evidence has gone the way of a lot of organic matter under water,'' Mr. Sinclair said.
