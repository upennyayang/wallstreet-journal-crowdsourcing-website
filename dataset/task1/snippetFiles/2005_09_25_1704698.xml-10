	President Bush's press secretary, Scott McClellan, replied to repeated questions about laxity in the early response to Katrina devastation with two classic counterattacking phrases: ''If you want to continue to engage in finger-pointing and blame-gaming, that's fine.''
	This triggered a counter-counterattack from liberal columnists. ''McClellan must have been unaware,'' wrote E.J. Dionne Jr. in The Washington Post, ''that the White House had been organizing a finger-pointing, blame-gaming project of its own'' -- working, as The New York Times put it, ''to shift the blame away from the White House and toward officials of New Orleans and Louisiana who, as it happens, are Democrats.'' The key word in attacking the counterattack phrases is accountability.
	Thirteen years before, after a riot burned out sections of Los Angeles, a group of protesters held up a sign reading, ''If You Won't Help Us, Clinton Will.'' The elder President Bush's response was, ''This is no time to play the blame game.''
	The pointed finger, now a symbol of unfair accusation, began its metaphoric rise in 1829 as the finger of scorn: ''It was a shame,'' wrote Pierce Egan in his British fisticuffs serial, ''Boxiana,'' ''that pure and honorable men should be suspected of such doings.
