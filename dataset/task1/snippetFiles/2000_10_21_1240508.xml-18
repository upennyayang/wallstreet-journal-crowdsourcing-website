	Since phalanxes of rabid Mets and Yankees fans are front and center whenever the video-lights go on, passions today seem deep enough, but they aren't those of 1956. Traditional borough nationalism has attenuated in the decades since baseball was truly America's pastime. And many of both team's fans now come from the suburbs.
	But in the 1950's, ''the team you rooted for was as much a part of your identity as your religion was,'' Ms. Goodwin said.
	Such was the presence of the Dodgers and Yankees in 1956 that it took a significant act of will by neighborhood Benedict Arnolds to avoid rooting for the borough team.
	''Growing up in Brooklyn you were unable not to be a Dodger,'' said Sanford Teller, a Manhattan public-relations consultant who used to take the trolley from Borough Park to Ebbets Field. ''Giant fans were pummeled.''
	In Our Lady of Lourdes parish on the Upper West Side not far from the Polo Grounds, ''it was all Giants,'' said Peter Maas, the Manhattan author, who grew up in the neighborhood and attended the 1956 Series as a reporter for Collier's magazine.
