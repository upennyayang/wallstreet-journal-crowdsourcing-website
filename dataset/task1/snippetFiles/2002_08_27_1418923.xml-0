	After six years of twice-weekly psychotherapy sessions, Eric had plenty of insight. But his anxiety level had barely changed.
	He was still bedeviled by a ceaseless urge to wash his hands and shameful and repetitive violent thoughts. Out of desperation and against the wishes of his therapist, he visited my office to discuss the possibility of medication.
	''I thought I could understand my way out of my obsessive compulsive disorder,'' he recalled recently. ''I wanted to be able to do it on my own, without medication.''
	What he did not remember was his vehement opposition to psychotropic medication on the ground that it was not natural and would change his brain chemistry.
	Of course, he was right. Like Eric, many patients and therapists share the view that psychotherapy is preferable to pharmacotherapy because it is more ''natural'' and because it supposedly gets to the root of the patient's problem. They are convinced that self-understanding will bring relief, whether the problem is anxiety, depression or obsessional thinking.
	Insight is a prerequisite of happiness, the theory goes, and well-being achieved without the hard work of psychotherapy is artificial and inauthentic.
