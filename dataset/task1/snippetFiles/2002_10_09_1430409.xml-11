	On Monday, investigators with a warrant raided the three- family home in central Newark where the Figueroas live. They said they discovered the three human skulls and bones that appeared to be from legs, arms and feet in a cauldron in a basement room.
	Mr. Maglione said that in Palo Mayombe, different body parts are used to call different spirits to cast various spells.
	''It is my understanding that the date of birth or death of the person whose bones are being used may be important to their ceremony,'' said Mr. Maglione, who successfully prosecuted a defendant last spring who was believed to be a Palo Mayombe adherent. ''Also they have been known to seek out the bones of a powerful politician or mobster, and skulls can sell for as much as $50,000.''
	The typical ceremony involves the invocation of a simbi, or spirit, according to Mr. Maglione and experts on the religion. In addition to the ritual, the person seeking the spirit and the spell it carries drinks a liquid in which the bones have been boiled. A single glass can cost as much as $200, the prosecutor said.
