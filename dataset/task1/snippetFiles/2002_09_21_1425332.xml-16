	''There is much to be debated about the Middle East and much in Israel's foreign and defense policy that can be and should be vigorously challenged,'' he said in his speech. Those caveats, however, did not persuade critics like Elizabeth Spelke, a psychology professor who also signed the divestiture petition. ''Labeling the petition anti-Semitic is a strategy to detract from the criticisms of Israel,'' Professor Spelke said. ''It turns the substance of a political debate into a debate of morals and supposed racism.'' But Eli Sprecher, a Harvard sophomore, said he welcomed Mr. Summers's willingness to speak out, saying: ''He's not just the president of a university, he's the president of Harvard. If there's a pretty big issue, he should take a stand on it.'' Mr. Sprecher said that Mr. Summers had made valid points about the divestment movement and that ''comparing Israel to apartheid South Africa does border on anti-Semitism.'' Lawrence S. Bacow, president of nearby Tufts University, applauded Mr. Summers for his stand. ''University presidents ought to raise important questions and I think he has,'' Mr. Bacow said, adding that he, too, was concerned about signs suggesting a rise in anti-Semitism on campuses.
