	Each year, the rankings get copious publicity on local television stations and in regional newspapers, where they appear under headlines that say things like ''Doctors' Group Raves About Food at Tri-City Airport.''
	This year's ratings of the top 12 major domestic airports gave the highest mark to Miami International Airport and the lowest to Las Vegas McCarran International Airport. In years past, the physicians' committee has been a little coy about how it determines which foods are healthy, but this year the announcement was direct in stating that the availability of ''low-fat, vegetarian'' entrees was the criterion used.
	Also each year, an opposition group called the Center for Consumer Freedom denounces the physicians' committee as a front for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, the animal-rights advocacy group that works to discourage the eating of meat and dairy products.
	This year's opposing news release was headlined ''Phony 'Physicians' Group Ranking Airport Food Is an Animal-Rights Front.''
	The Center for Consumer Freedom describes itself as a ''nonprofit coalition supported by restaurants, food companies and consumers.''
	As the annual food fight continued this week, I thought it was time to get the physicians' committee and its opponents on the record.
