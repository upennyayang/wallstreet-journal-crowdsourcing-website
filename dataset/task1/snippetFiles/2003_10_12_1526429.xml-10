	Enough said? No. There was the itchy problem of the absent college degree. So it was discreetly arranged, by an advocate of Murray among the Philological Society's members, that he receive one, an honorary LL.D. from Scotland. This was done in recognition of a book written by Murray in his spare time, ''The Dialect of the Southern Counties of Scotland.'' Meanwhile, the dictionary enterprise had stalled under the maladministration of Furnivall, and simultaneously there was the unsettled question of who exactly would emerge as an appropriate publisher-patron. The society wanted a firm connection with a creditable and resourceful institution. The project whiffed by the elders of Cambridge, who turned it down (''the largest wrong decision in publishing history,'' the editor of the Cambridge press wrote some years later). Several associations were considered, and the possibility that the arrangement would be profitable was stressed, due note being taken of the 4,000-page Littré French dictionary, published in Paris at the price of £4, which had sold a staggering 40,000 copies.
	The society's proposal was more comprehensive, there being no British language authority that authorized a word or prescribed its meaning.
