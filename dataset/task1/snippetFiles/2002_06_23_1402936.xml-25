	On a catwalk between two buildings, Mr. Bowers points out a 600-foot-high red crane and a swarm of men installing the first of four selective catalytic reduction systems, known as S.C.R.'s, part of an investment of $1.2 billion that Southern is making at plants in the Atlanta and Birmingham areas to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides. That pollutant reacts with sunlight and creates ground-level ozone, or smog, the gas that inflames the lungs of people like asthma patients.
	In most of the country, cars contribute the greater proportion of nitrogen oxides to the air. But in the Birmingham area, about 60 percent of the pollutant comes from Alabama Power's nearby plants, county health officials say. Birmingham, the state's biggest city, and neighboring Shelby County are in violation of federal standards for nitrogen oxides. Once all the pollution control units are in place at Miller by May 2005, Alabama Power expects emissions of nitrogen oxides to fall by more than 80 percent. That, Alabama Power says, will put Birmingham in compliance with current federal air quality standards.
	''Ozone is a health issue and we're the first to say it,'' Mr. Bowers said.
