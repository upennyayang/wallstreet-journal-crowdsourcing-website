	While Rafael Palmeiro and Sammy Sosa denied ever using steroids and faced no interrogation about it, McGwire refused to address the issue.
	''I'm not here to talk about the past,'' McGwire said repeatedly. He used the sentence as the equivalent of the Fifth Amendment mantra that he would refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate him.
	McGwire's Washington lawyers obviously did not want him to use that response because it would make him sound guilty nonetheless. ''I'm not here to talk about the past'' didn't earn McGwire a pass. Baseball executives who commented off the record said that McGwire had hurt himself.
	''I was surprised by it,'' La Russa said of McGwire's approach. ''He's made a statement where he's denied it. I thought it was a great time for him to make that same statement. He had the biggest stage of all to say it and it looked to me like he was coached in the other direction and it surprised me.''
	La Russa returned to the same refrain twice more in what was not a lengthy interview with reporters. ''A couple of key comments were not made,'' he said.
