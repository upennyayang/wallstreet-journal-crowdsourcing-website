	But other scientists are still skeptical, saying it may be only a coincidence that rising temperatures go hand in hand with growing beetle infestations. Some say he has found a big piece of the puzzle, but not all of it.
	''I think Ed Berg is only partially correct,'' said Dr. Ed Holsten, who studies insects for the Forest Service in Alaska. The trees on the Kenai are old, and ripe for beetle outbreaks. If they had been logged, or burned in fire, it might have kept the bugs down, Dr. Holsten said.
	The spruce beetle, which is about a quarter-inch long with six legs, is barely visible to most people who roam through evergreen forests in the West and Alaska. Large swaths of forest in Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming have been felled by the bug. But nothing has approached the Alaska kill.
	The beetles take to the air in spring, looking for trees to attack. When they find a vulnerable stand, they will signal to other beetles ''a chemical message,'' Dr. Holsten says. They burrow under the bark, feeding on woody capillary tissue that the tree uses to transport nutrients.
