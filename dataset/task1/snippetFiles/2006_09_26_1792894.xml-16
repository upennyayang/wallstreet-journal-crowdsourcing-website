	Predicting the prevalence of solar flares and other solar events that create electromagnetic disturbances can be critical for keeping communications working. The latest in a long line of solar observatories, launched in Japan last week, specializes in such ''weather'' forecasting.
	Solar B, as the spacecraft is called, includes instruments for measuring extreme ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. Over three years it will study how the Sun's magnetic field interacts with the corona, the outer region of extremely hot plasma, in an effort to better understand how disturbances happen.
	Krill Mix the Oceans
	The oceans may seem monolithic, but scientists who study them know better. Rather, they are highly stratified, with water layers that vary in salinity, temperature, and oxygen and nutrient content.
	Because only the surface layer gets sunlight, that's where the phytoplankton live. But the plankton use up nutrients in the water, which must be replenished from nutrient-rich layers below.
	''The question is, how do you get enough nutrients into the surface layer for the phytoplankton?'' said John F. Dower, a professor at the University of Victoria in British Columbia.
	The answer is by mixing of the layers.
