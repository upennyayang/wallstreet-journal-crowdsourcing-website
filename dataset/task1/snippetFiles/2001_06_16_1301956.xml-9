	Born near London on Dec. 30, 1905, Mr. Puleston grew up in the fishing village of Leigh-on-Sea on the Thames estuary in Essex, where he acquired a love of boats and a taste for adventure. He also became an avid naturalist and a skilled painter of birds.
	After studying biology and naval architecture at London University, he set out across the Atlantic in 1931 with a friend in a small sailing boat on what was to become a six-year odyssey down the eastern seaboard of the United States, around the Caribbean and across the South Pacific, with interludes teaching sailing at Rye, N.Y., and running a coconut plantation on Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands.
	In 1937, Mr. Puleston reached China just as the Sino-Japanese War was beginning. He managed to escape any trouble and made it to London on the Trans-Siberian Railway. He published an account of his adventures in ''Blue Water Vagabond'' (Doubleday, 1939).
	He married Betty Wellington of New York in 1939 and became an American citizen in 1942, the year he started working with a firm of naval architects; he helped design the Duck-like two-and-a-half-ton DUKW amphibious landing craft adopted by the Allies.
