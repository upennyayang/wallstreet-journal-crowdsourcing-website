	Ford also faces a second lawsuit asserting that it unfairly discriminated against older white males in its grading.It would not comment on the litigation but defended its use of grades. ''We believe the system is fair and nondiscriminatory,'' a company spokeswoman said. ''We are in a very competitive industry, and we need all of our employees to be the best they can be.''
	At Conoco, employees contend that the company discriminated against United States citizens and older workers when it laid off a dozen geophysicists and other scientists in 1999 based on a ranking from one to four, according to a lawsuit filed last year. The majority of those let go were Americans, according to the suit, as opposed to British, Norwegian and Canadian professionals.
	''The rating system was selectively enforced, and there were instances of manipulation,'' said John Zavitsanos, the lawyer representing the workers. Even though some were given higher ratings on earlier rankings, they were eventually given the lowest possible rating of four.
	Conoco, based in Houston, has extensive operations in the North Sea, and many of the senior managers at the division in question are British, according to Mr. Zavitsanos.
