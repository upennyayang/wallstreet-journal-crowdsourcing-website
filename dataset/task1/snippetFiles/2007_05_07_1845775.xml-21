	Sparring between liberation theologians and Benedict -- whose own theology was formed in reaction to the reach of Nazi ideology -- has been long and bitter. In 1984, as the Vatican official charged with supervising questions of faith and doctrine, he declared that ''the theology of liberation is a singular heresy.''
	More recently, he said, ''it seems to me we need not theology of liberation, but theology of martyrdom,'' and argued that the movement will become a valid theology ''only when it refuses to accept power and worldly logic'' and instead emphasizes ''inner liberty.'' But that was when his job was to carry out John Paul's orders, and there is speculation here that his views may have softened somewhat.
	That helps explain some of the theological maneuvering that has been going on in Latin America recently.
	At the behest of conservatives, the Vatican has imposed sanctions on the liberation theologians Gustavo Guti√©rrez of Peru, Leonardo Boff of Brazil and, most recently, Jon Sobrino of El Salvador, a Jesuit born in Spain.
	That drew a sharp rebuke from Felipe Aquino, a conservative theologian whose views are often broadcast on Catholic radio stations here.
