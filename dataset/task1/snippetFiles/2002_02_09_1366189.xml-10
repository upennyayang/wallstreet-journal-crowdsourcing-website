	Others believe Heisenberg wanted to ''do a little espionage,'' as the historian Richard Rhodes put it, and learn about the Allied effort from Bohr, who fled Denmark in 1943 and worked on the Manhattan Project. Mr. Frayn points out that Bohr's letters confirm certain elements of the meeting that were known from other sources -- for example, that Heisenberg made some intensely offensive statements, at least publicly, about the inevitability of a German victory. But when it comes to what Bohr and many others later saw as Heisenberg's roundabout suggestions that he hoped to stop the German project, the letters contradict him. In a draft made the year of Bohr's death, in 1962, Bohr tells Heisenberg it is ''quite incomprehensible to me that you should think that you hinted to me that the German physicists would do all they could to prevent such an application of atomic science.'' That angry sentence, Mr. Frayn said, ''appears to be denying some claim made by Heisenberg.'' But Mr. Frayn says there is no recorded claim by Heisenberg explicit enough to have warranted this rejoinder. So in this view, Bohr, the spirit, is left arguing with the wind.
