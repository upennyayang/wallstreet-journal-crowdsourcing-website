	In 1937, Mr. Puleston reached China just as the Sino-Japanese War was beginning. He managed to escape any trouble and made it to London on the Trans-Siberian Railway. He published an account of his adventures in ''Blue Water Vagabond'' (Doubleday, 1939).
	He married Betty Wellington of New York in 1939 and became an American citizen in 1942, the year he started working with a firm of naval architects; he helped design the Duck-like two-and-a-half-ton DUKW amphibious landing craft adopted by the Allies.
	Mr. Puleston was sent back to the Pacific, where he trained American forces on the craft, organized a training school for the British in India who used it and took part in amphibious operations in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea and Burma, where he was wounded in the spine by a Japanese shell splinter.
	After a period in the hospital, he went to Britain to train allied forces in preparation for the Normandy landings. He then returned to the Pacific to organizing a DUKW training school on Oahu and take part in the invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, where he was when the war ended in September 1945.
