	Despite the criticism of research that delves into sex-based differences, Dr. Halpern said, it is important to understand what cognitive skills are in play if virtual reality environments are to become a more common teaching and research tool. ''By bringing some attention to it, we can see where people might need more training in special skills,'' she said. ''By pretending the differences aren't there, you're not really helping anyone.'' The larger issue is how some virtual environments may favor individual aptitudes or learning styles, a question that opens a whole new area of research. ''We're just beginning to measure how humans perform in virtual environments, and how they're affected either negatively or positively,'' said Susan M. Porter, a manager of advanced simulation technology at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. People's perceptions of distance, space and movement are often exaggerated or altered in computer simulations, she said. When certain variables are changed, the sex differences can favor women, tests by Dr. Porter's unit showed. When subjects were equipped with head-mounted displays and ''see through'' video technology and surrounded by a virtual reality backdrop, ''women performed better than men on average'' in manipulating real objects and controls, Dr. Porter said.
