	The absence of a national health system in the United States means that the Big Three take on social responsibilities that the governments in Japan and Germany bear. Gary Lapidus, a Goldman, Sachs analyst, referred in his recent report to the Big Three as ''H.M.O.'s with wheels'' that only happen to make cars. G.M. alone provides medical coverage to nearly half a percent of the United States population, when dependents are included.
	And although Toyota and Honda assemble in the United States most of the cars they sell here, their plants are much newer, their work forces younger and their retirees number in the hundreds, not the hundreds of thousands that depend on the Big Three. They are also not unionized, except in joint ventures with the Big Three.
	While the out-of-pocket health costs of auto workers have not risen in years, many American workers have seen quite the opposite, and even white-collar Big Three employees can pay several hundred dollars a month in premiums and other out-of-pocket expenses. Auto union members enrolled in H.M.O.'s and P.P.O.'s
