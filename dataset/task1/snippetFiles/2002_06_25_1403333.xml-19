	''It's very hard to live among the dead spruce; it's been a real kick in the teeth,'' said Dr. Berg. ''We all love this beautiful forest.''
	One reason Dr. Berg may have been able to see the larger implications of the beetle attack when others saw only dead trees is that he is one of few government scientists for the Fish and Wildlife Service who is paid to study the big picture.
	His title is ecologist for the Kenai refuge. ''When they hired me they felt the need to look at things from a broader scale rather than simply do moose counts,'' he said.
	Working with a doctoral student, Chris Fastie, on a federal grant, Dr. Berg has been matching the volume of dead trees to climate. Since 1987, he said, the Kenai Peninsula has had a string of above-normal temperature years, particularly in the summer. Each of those years coincided with huge outbreaks of beetle infestation and dead trees, matching warmer years and a rise in spruce kills in the early 1970's. Dr. Berg found a similar pattern in the Kluane area of the Canada's Yukon Territory, where it is much colder.
