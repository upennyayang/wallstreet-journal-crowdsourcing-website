	''I completely disagree with Randi Weingarten's comment that there are other methods of teaching,'' Ms. Fass wrote in response to a question. ''A.S.L. is a language, and how is that possible for her to say that there are other methods? Is she fluent in A.S.L., and if not, what right does she have?''
	Terri Thomson, the Queens representative on the board, spearheaded the effort to make sign language the primary language at the school.
	She said on Friday that though she was not familiar with what had happened on Tuesday, she was aware of continuing staffing changes to ensure that students were well educated.
	''At each of our public agenda meetings, a group of parents would come to testify because their children were getting poor educations,'' Ms. Thomson said. ''Some were being taught through sign language interpreters who were not teachers, and the quality was poor. We heard from students who told of failing tests. Many said they felt isolated going to school, walking around with sign language interpreters. What they cried out for was a program where they could be taught in their home language -- A.S.L.''
