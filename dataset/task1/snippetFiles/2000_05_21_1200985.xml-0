	Early this spring, long before the trees had leafed, I found myself standing in the rain in a dark field in southern New Jersey waiting for woodcocks -- shy, chunky, long-billed birds -- to rise out of the shadows and begin their mating dance. Sometimes called timberdoodles, woodcocks are not the most graceful birds on the planet. Their eyes are spaced so far apart that you might wonder how they can see the trees in front of them. As the late winter days begin to lengthen, they throw caution to the wind, and at dawn and dusk the males rise straight up into the air some 200 or 300 feet and then spiral down, uttering a plaintive, musical series of notes. Although deterred by cold, they don't seem to be bothered by rain -- and that's a good thing, too, because this ''sky dancing'' is how they maintain themselves as a species. The mystery is what was I, a devoted urbanite, doing there?
	I've been watching birds for six years. It all began at a brunch in Manhattan when someone happened to mention that soon the warblers would be arriving in Central Park.
