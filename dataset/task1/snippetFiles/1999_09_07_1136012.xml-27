	Credit for a discovery is often disputed, particularly when the finding is important. Dr. Tonegawa told reporter for The Star-Ledger of Newark, that Dr. Tsien may have started developing the smarter mice while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and accused him of being uncollegial. If the mice were developed in Dr. Tonegawa's lab, M.I.T. would have rights to them and Dr. Tonegawa could exercise a lab chief's claim to a share of the academic credit.
	Dr. Tsien said he was ''totally surprised'' by Dr. Tonegawa's remarks. His smarter mice experiment was conceived and executed entirely at Princeton, he said. Other scientists have patented the NR2B gene but Princeton has filed for a ''use patent,'' the right to use the gene in ways suggested by Dr. Tsien's work.
	Dr. Tonegawa, who was traveling in Japan last week, did not respond to a request made through his secretary for an interview.
	Dr. J. David Litster, M.I.T.'s vice president for research and the official in charge of disputes over scientific conduct, said that M.I.T. ''is not endorsing Tonegawa's claims, certainly not until we know what they are.
