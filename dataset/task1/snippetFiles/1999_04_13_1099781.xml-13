	When the chorda tympani is damaged, its inhibitory function is disrupted, prompting increased activity in other nerves. In an elegant series of experiments, Dr. Bartoshuk and Dr. John Kveton, an otological surgeon at Yale, have found that when the chorda tympani is anesthetized, research subjects experience intensified sensation in areas served by other taste nerves. In about 40 percent of the subjects, anesthetizing the chorda tympani produced taste phantoms, the result, Dr. Bartoshuk argues, of the disinhibition.
	In other work, to be presented at the chemoreception sciences meeting, the psychologist and her colleagues showed that when the chorda tympani is anesthetized, pain sensitivity increases in regions served by the trigeminal nerve on the opposite side of the tongue. Supertasters, who have a denser field of pain fibers, had the greatest increase in pain sensation. In another study, the researchers found that patients with burning mouth syndrome showed severe damage to the chorda tympani, suggesting pain phantoms may appear when the chorda tympani's inhibiting influence is interrupted. ''All of a sudden, the genie is out of the bottle,'' Dr. Bartoshuk said.
	The taste system's feedback loop, she said, may make evolutionary sense, insuring, for example, that if one nerve is damaged the others increase their activity to compensate.
