	While there seems to be more evidence that the Hussar did not carry treasure than that it did, one reported fact that has encouraged Hussar seekers is that the British themselves mounted at least three expeditions in search of the ship.
	''In the spring of 1794 two brigs were dispatched from England to undertake the recovery of the lost treasure,'' The New-York Daily Times wrote in 1856. ''They came fully equipped with men, a large diving-bell and other equipments for sub-marine explorations.''
	The Times also wrote of a 1856 expedition during which a number of bones had been found, ''showing, evidently, that a part, if not all the American prisoners on board, were manacled and chained.''

	One morning at an East Side Starbucks, (about as close as one can get to the legacy of Melville in New York these days), after changing tables to avoid being overheard, Mr. Governali looked left and right, hunched his shoulders and said with hushed urgency: ''The British sent three expeditions here to locate the ship. They had sunken ships all over the world. Why come here for that one ship?''
