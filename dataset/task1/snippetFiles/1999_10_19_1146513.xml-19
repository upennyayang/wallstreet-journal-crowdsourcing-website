	Because Mr. Spitzer used family wealth to finance most of his campaign, she said, ''he's the first statewide elected official I know who is beholden to no one.'' Since the spring, the list of environmental cases has steadily grown. Many were referred by the Department of Environmental Conservation -- the traditional means by which environmental violations are prosecuted by the state -- but Mr. Spitzer has also been pursuing leads and building cases on his own as well. They range from small-scale attacks on companies that are believed to have polluted neighborhoods to wide-ranging forays against the giant energy companies whose coal-fired plants are thought to contribute to the sterilization of Adirondack lakes and the smog that cloaks much of the state each summer. The environmental bureau also dusted off a rarely used legal weapon -- public nuisance laws -- to go after some companies that were creating chronic pollution problems. This was a tactic last employed by two other Democratic attorneys general, G. Oliver Koppell and Robert Abrams, who both served during the terms of a Democratic Governor, Mario M. Cuomo. In such cases, the attorney general does not have to move in lock step with actions by the state environmental conservation agency.
