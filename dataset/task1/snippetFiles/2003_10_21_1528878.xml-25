	There are some obstacles to overcome before even trying to put the DNA fragments together into the correct order. Extracting DNA fragments from the environment can be difficult, particularly from soil, which contains acids that break down the genetic material. And one or two species may dominate in an environment, outnumbering other species by as much as 100,000 to 1. So the DNA fragments will be mainly from the dominant species.
	''When somebody says they are going to sequence all the bacteria in a soil sample, well, that's rubbish,'' said Dr. Julian Davies, an emeritus professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of British Columbia.
	Dr. Davies started a company to find new antibiotics by extracting genes from soil bacteria that could not be cultured in the laboratory. But antibiotic production is often governed by many genes, not just one, and it was impossible to extract DNA fragments large enough to contain all the necessary genes, he said.
	Still, sampling techniques are improving. Diversa has a method, based on the relative density of DNA's chemical units, to prevent rarer species in a sample from being overlooked.
