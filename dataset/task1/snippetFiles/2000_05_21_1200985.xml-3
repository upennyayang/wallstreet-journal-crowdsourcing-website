	With a convert's zeal, I began spending countless hours stalking birds with my binoculars, and as soon as spring was over, I began to look forward to fall, when they would come back on their return flight. I began subscribing to mainstream periodicals like Audubon and Natural History and then to specialty journals with names like Birder's World, Birdwatcher's Digest and Winging It. I bought Birding by Ear tapes and Peterson's guide to Eastern birds, then the more comprehensive ''National Geographic Guide'' and species-specific volumes like ''Warblers of the Americas'' and ''Hawks in Flight.'' I began to plan my vacations and even my work assignments to birding hot spots like Madera Canyon in southern Arizona, Bosque del Apache in New Mexico, the Orkneys in Scotland, the Everglades.
	I had stumbled into a vast, largely invisible world. It seemed like a private discovery, until it dawned on me that I was part of a quiet revolution. The first time I traveled for the express purpose of birding I went to Point Pelee in Ontario. Pulling into the bed-and-breakfast where my wife and I were staying, I saw a car with vanity plates that read ''Birder.''
