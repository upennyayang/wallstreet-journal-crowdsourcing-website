	For example, Dr. William L. Crepet, a paleobotanist at Cornell University, said he would not be shocked if there were some shifting around in these early branches of the family tree as studies continued, but he added, ''It looks pretty good for Amborella right now.'' For biologists seeking a window into the early evolution of flowering plants, the new findings are invaluable. Of particular interest is Amborella, the bush catapulted from obscurity to botanical stardom. Sandra Floyd and Dr. William E. Friedman, plant evolutionary biologists at the University of Colorado, are studying the evolution of a part of the seed, called the endosperm, that nourishes the plant embryo (or the human who eats the seed). Ms. Floyd said that to fully understand the evolution of this feature, which is unique to flowering plants, she and Dr. Friedman were studying the endosperm in Amborella, using material from the arboretum at the University of California at Santa Cruz, where the only Amborella in the continental United States grows. ''These are the types of things that people have been speculating about for decades, centuries,'' said Dr. Pamela Soltis of Washington State University, ''and now we can actually address them.''
