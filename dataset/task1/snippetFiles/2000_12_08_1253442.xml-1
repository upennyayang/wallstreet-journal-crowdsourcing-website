	Instead, the company, Celera Genomics, will put the data on its Web site, making them available to researchers free and to companies for a fee.
	The arrangement, announced by Celera and the editor of the journal Science, who said the paper would be published early next year, highlights the tricky financial issues that accompany the new era of genome research. Celera wants to sell its data. But scientific journals are committed to making all data related to its papers public.
	So how, Science's editors had asked, could they satisfy these conflicting goals? And did they want to set a precedent?
	Dr. Donald Kennedy, a Stanford University professor of environmental science who is editor of Science, said the issue arose in June when Celera and the publicly financed Human Genome Project were on the verge of announcing that they had each determined virtually the entire sequence of the genetic script that makes up a human being. Dr. Kennedy wanted to publish papers from the two groups describing this achievement.
	Ordinarily, the authors of such a paper would be expected to put all their data into GenBank, a database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.
