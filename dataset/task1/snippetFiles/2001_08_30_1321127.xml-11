	Dr. Meredith acknowledged that ''there were a number of people who expressed strong concerns'' about Dr. Reynolds, at the medical school and at the main campus, and that there had been friction between him and Dr. Reynolds. ''I was concerned that from time to time she was not forthcoming and did not follow the position of the system,'' he said.
	John Rogers, a state representative from Birmingham and also executive director of minority programs for the Birmingham campus, said: ''My real feeling is that sometimes when you are very assertive, you overshadow other people in the system, maybe even the chancellor. And especially if you are a woman doing a job, that creates a problem here in the South. She stands up to them, and that upsets them.''
	Another Reynolds admirer, Cleophus Thomas Jr., a university trustee, said that he had heard that some medical faculty members had threatened to leave unless a date was set for Dr. Reynolds to step down as president. He said that although Dr. Reynolds had cooperated with efforts to restructure health services, others saw her as an obstacle to greater privatization and more profits for the medical school's doctors.
