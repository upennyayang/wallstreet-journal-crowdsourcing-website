	According to the census, the number of homeowners in the region grew to 3.3 million in 2005 from 3.1 million in 2001.
	But an increasing number of them are spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing, the level that the federal government considers the limit of affordability. Property taxes grew, from a median of $4,800 to $5,800. And homeowners borrowed heavily, either to get into a more expensive home or to extract equity from the homes they already owned.
	That combination pushed the proportion of homeowners in the region who were spending upward of 30 percent of their income on housing to 38.2 percent in 2005 from 29.5 percent in 2000, the census data show. More ominously, the number of households paying 50 percent or more of their income for housing grew to 15.6 percent from 10.9 percent.
	''It's eating up such a large share of homeowners' budgets now, and that may be untenable, particularly if their income is disrupted in any way,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Economy.com. New buyers who put down little on their homes are especially vulnerable, Mr. Zandi said.
