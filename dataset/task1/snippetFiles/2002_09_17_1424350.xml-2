	Using airborne spectrometers like those that have mapped the face of Jupiter, researchers charted potentially toxic dust from the disintegrated towers. Others pored over weather-satellite data to see how the lack of contrails in the planeless skies affected weather patterns.
	But in scrutinizing Sept. 11 from aircraft and spacecraft, the researchers also added a wide-field view to the growing archive of indelible imagery from that extraordinary day.
	Some are available at a Web site for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, www.gsfc .nasa.gov.
	At NASA's Langley Research Center, in Hampton, Va., Louis Nguyen, a computer engineer, compiled images from the weather-tracking GOES-8 satellite, pulling data recorded over New York City every quarter hour in grainy half-mile-wide pixels.
	At 8:45 a.m. on that crystalline morning, one minute before the first plane strikes, the skies are clear and bright. By 9:02 a gray puff hangs over Manhattan. In successive shots, a bright tendril snakes south along the Jersey Shore and by noon spreads into a misty veil, giving no hint of the calamity below.
	Secretive events later in the day were unexpectedly witnessed.
