	''When I cook dinner, if there's something I can leave on the stove, I'll post an item and come back,'' he said. ''I haven't burned anything yet.''
	While his daughter plays games on her computer at night, Mr. Reynolds will sit with her, updating InstaPundit on a machine of his own. When she and her mother -- Helen Smith, a forensic psychologist, author and budding documentarian -- go to bed, Mr. Reynolds is back to InstaPundit again.
	''It's gotten to the point where if I go four or five hours without posting, I get e-mails asking where I am,'' he said.
	But it's not just readers' expectations that keep Mr. Reynolds blogging. He has warned many people thinking about starting a blog that it can quickly become an addiction. He seems to know from experience.
	''Today, I was in the gym, on the treadmill, watching CNN,'' he said. ''And as I was watching it, I was composing a blog entry in my head. Then I thought, 'This really isn't normal.'''
	Money doesn't seem to be a motivator, either.
	''The Internet's just a big playground for guys like me,'' he said.
