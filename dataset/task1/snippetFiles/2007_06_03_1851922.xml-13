	Cheap biofuels could eliminate or reduce the use of the fossil fuels whose combustion contributes to climate change. So far, most biofuel ventures have tried to create better ethanol fuels by converting different kinds of ''biomass'' -- everything from corn to sugar cane to switchgrass and jatropha trees -- to fermentable sugars. These sugars can then be brewed and distilled into conventional ethanol.
	Amyris chose to ask something more basic and more interesting: What would perfect fuels look like if they were designed from scratch? The start-up decided to concentrate on the second stage of creating a biofuel: fermenting sugars into fuel.
	The company wanted chemical compounds that could be fermented from sugars derived from any biomass. The fuels had to have an energy content higher than ethanol and be useable in today's automobile, diesel and jet engines. Finally, the company wanted fuels that were insoluble in water, and hence could be transported through the same pipelines that now move oil.
	Over the last year and a half, Amyris has created in its labs microorganisms whose metabolic pathways are yielding alternatives to diesel, jet fuel and gasoline. Now the company is working to make the conversion from sugars to fuel more efficient.
