	Known inside the company as the Cell Project, the first new systems are intended to emerge in 2004 and will have clock speeds beginning at four gigahertz, more than twice the speed of today's fastest microprocessors.
	Dr. Devari said that a single four-processor device intended for the home would have a teraflop of computing power -- a trillion mathematical operations a second. Such a device is likely to sell for several hundred dollars compared with the 8,192-processor ASCI White machine, which cost about $110 million and has computed up to 7.2 teraflops.
	The top 500 ranking of supercomputers is compiled twice a year by Hans Meuer of the University of Mannheim, Erich Strohmaier and Horst Simon of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center of the Department of Energy and Dr. Dongarra of the University of Tennessee. But power is becoming harder and harder to track.
	Recently the group has added a second list of ''cluster'' machines to help track new low-cost supercomputers that are made up of collections of stripped down PC-boards.
	But the computing world has moved beyond that as well.
	The distributed Internet computing model will increasingly change the face of the computing world, according to Dr. Devari.
