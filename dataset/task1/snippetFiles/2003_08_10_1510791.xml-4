	''My saints aren't in the self-abnegation category,'' he says. ''They're lusty, hard-drinking, partying saints.'' In July, a clothing designer and musician became Saint Petra, ''an intergalactic space stewardess,'' who says that when the planet is in turmoil ''it's time to get off the globe and go-go galactic.'' Saint Olga, the zaftig ''Gypsy Saint of everywhere and nowhere'' -- who holds a bottle of wine in one arm, a pug in the other, and suggests we ''get drunk, make a baby, and bark like a dog'' -- was sent out in December 2001 as an ''alternative holiday'' saint, ''in response to all that sadness and smoke hanging in the air after 9/11,'' Mr. Gosfield says. (One of the few saints he describes as ''hectoring'' shows a woman -- Mr. Gosfield's sister -- somberly staring into the camera, amid the words ''From Warsaw to Rwanda, From Wall Street to Baghdad, St. Lizette remembers all those who fall to bullets, bayonets and bombs.'')
	Mr. Gosfield, who has produced illustrations for a wide variety of major magazines, and who once designed a Christmas window for Barney's featuring the author David Rakoff as Sigmund Freud, brings a considerable degree of visual sophistication to his project.
