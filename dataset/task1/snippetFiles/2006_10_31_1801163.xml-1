	But one of the more important issues this century is generating no serious discussion on the campaign trail. And, in place of a drumroll, let's look at the chemistry experiment in which we're all taking part.
	If you think of the earth's surface as a great beaker, then it's filled mostly with ocean water. It is slightly alkaline, and that's what creates a hospitable home for fish, coral reefs and plankton -- and indirectly, higher up the food chain, for us.
	But scientists have discovered that the carbon dioxide we're spewing into the air doesn't just heat up the atmosphere and lead to rising seas. Much of that carbon is absorbed by the oceans, and there it produces carbonic acid -- the same stuff found in soda pop.
	That makes oceans a bit more acidic, impairing the ability of certain shellfish to produce shells, which, like coral reefs, are made of calcium carbonate. A recent article in Scientific American explained the indignity of being a dissolving mollusk in an acidic ocean: ''Drop a piece of chalk (calcium carbonate) into a glass of vinegar (a mild acid) if you need a demonstration of the general worry: the chalk will begin dissolving immediately.''
