	''There is a lot of convergent evolution in sensory-motor tasks among very distantly related animals,'' Dr. Land said. ''For example, flies and primates can track targets with their eyes using similar basic strategies, though those of primates are more elaborate.''
	Dr. Land's colleague Dr. Thomas Collett, who has worked with him on studies of male flies' intercepting females, thinks that navigational behavior involves a combination of instinct and experience. ''The mix depends on where you are in the animal kingdom,'' he said. ''In flies, it is likely that the behavior is mostly preprogrammed. In mammals, learning plays a larger role.''
	Studies with infants have shown that the basic ability to predict object motion is present very early, before the infant can successfully reach for objects.
	Dr. Claes von Hofsten and his colleagues at Uppsala University in Sweden found that 2-month-old babies were able to hold their gaze on a moving target -- a task that requires making eye movements in anticipation of the target's position at a future instant.
	''The ability to make smooth pursuit eye movements appears very rapidly over just a few weeks of development,'' Dr. von Hofsten said.
