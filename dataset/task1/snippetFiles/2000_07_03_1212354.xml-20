	Under the agency's classification scheme, the only place wolves would remain endangered would be portions of southern Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, where efforts to bolster a particularly rare subspecies have faltered, wildlife officials say.
	As drafts of the new wolf classification proposal have circulated, private conservation groups, scientists, ranchers and others with an interest in the animal have begun lobbying for changes and girding for hearings and -- inevitably -- lawsuits.
	Once it is formally released, the proposed classification change will be the subject of four months of public comment -- twice the required length -- and eight months of internal discussions and possible changes before it becomes a rule.
	The tug of war now is between those who want wolves restored to broader parts of their range, including the southern Rockies and the Northeast, and those who say that the existing numbers are sufficient.
	The Endangered Species Act includes miles of wiggle room on this point, containing no clear guidance on how much of a species' original range needs to be restored before it is declared saved.
	A recent draft of the proposal was provided to a reporter by someone outside the Fish and Wildlife Service.
