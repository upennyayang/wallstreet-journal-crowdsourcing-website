	From the beginning, results varied wildly. One early patient simply rose from his hospital bed on Christmas Eve, put on his hat over the bandages and headed straight for a local saloon to celebrate. Another patient, a 60-year-old woman suffering from agitated depression, became paralyzed on her left side a few hours after the operation, lost the ability to speak, and fell into a coma. She died six days later. More typical were patients who experienced temporary relief from anxiety, obsessions, or hallucinations but later slipped back into severe metal illness, or who became strangely apathetic and lacking in spontaneity. One of his less successful patients was Rosemary Kennedy, a sister of John F. Kennedy, who underwent a lobotomy for agitated depression in 1941 but remained institutionalized for the rest of her life.
	Freeman had a high tolerance for failure. He was taking difficult cases and, as often as not, making it possible for them to go home and put together some semblance of a normal life. In time, he developed a new technique, transorbital lobotomy, that eliminated many of the side effects of prefrontal lobotomy by entering the brain through the eye socket rather than the cranium.
