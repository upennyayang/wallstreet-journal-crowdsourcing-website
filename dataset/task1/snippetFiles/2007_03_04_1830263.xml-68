	One of the most vocal adaptationists is David Sloan Wilson, an occasional thorn in the side of both Scott Atran and Richard Dawkins. Wilson, an evolutionary biologist at the State University of New York at Binghamton, focuses much of his argument at the group level. ''Organisms are a product of natural selection,'' he wrote in ''Darwin's Cathedral: Evolution, Religion, and the Nature of Society,'' which came out in 2002, the same year as Atran's book, and staked out the adaptationist view. ''Through countless generations of variation and selection, [organisms] acquire properties that enable them to survive and reproduce in their environments. My purpose is to see if human groups in general, and religious groups in particular, qualify as organismic in this sense.'' Wilson's father was Sloan Wilson, author of ''The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,'' an emblem of mid-'50s suburban anomie that was turned into a film starring Gregory Peck. Sloan Wilson became a celebrity, with young women asking for his autograph, especially after his next novel, ''A Summer Place,'' became another blockbuster movie. The son grew up wanting to do something to make his famous father proud.
