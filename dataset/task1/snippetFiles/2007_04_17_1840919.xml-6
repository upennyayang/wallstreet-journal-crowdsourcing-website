	''Young males pick out an older male -- it doesn't have to be the alpha -- and follow him around and study everything he does or doesn't do,'' Dr. Goodall explained. ''It's part of their separation from Mom.''
	Dr. Goodall described her earliest experiences observing such social traits in the wild. At first, the Gombe chimps fled whenever she appeared.
	''You can imagine what it was like for the chimpanzees,'' she said. ''They had never seen a white ape before.''
	She settled for watching the animals from a distance with binoculars. She said she always wore the same clothes and kept to the same routine, never making an approach that might seem threatening. After a few months, her patience was rewarded. An older male, whom she named David Greybeard, ventured toward her.
	''I held out a banana, and he kept getting closer and closer,'' she said. ''He was my link to the others, getting me through the door to their world.''
	Soon, Dr. Goodall saw David Greybeard and other chimps breaking and modifying sticks for ''fishing'' termites and ants from their nests. Humans, it seemed, were not the only toolmakers.
