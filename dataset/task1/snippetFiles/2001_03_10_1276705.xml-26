	But a bill could be written that controls the gas while stating it is not a ''pollutant,'' according to William F. Tyndall, vice president for environmental services and federal affairs at the Cinergy Corporation, a power company based in Cincinnati that has a fleet of coal-fired plants around the Midwest but supports a comprehensive plant cleanup.
	''We've been promoting this idea and see it as an elegant solution to a very difficult situation,'' Mr. Tyndall said. ''I think it has a real shot.''
	Cinergy, American Electric Power -- a huge coal-dependent midwestern power company -- and some other utilities say they would accede to the limits in the expectation that the bill would provide flexibility. That could come in the form of allowing utilities to trade emissions credits earned by reducing emissions or planting forests, which sop up carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and store the carbon in wood and soil.
	Just as important, Mr. Tyndall said, such a bill would eliminate uncertainty about future regulation, making it much easier for a company to decide which of its existing power plants to improve, which to shift to cleaner fuels like natural gas, and which to shut down.
