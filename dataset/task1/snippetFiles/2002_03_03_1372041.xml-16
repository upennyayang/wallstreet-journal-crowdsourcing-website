	On July 11, 1994, that department finally acknowledged that ''a virus provided by the Institut Pasteur was used by National Institutes of Health scientists who invented the American H.I.V. test kit in 1984.'' It promised the French $6 million in restitution. That is as close as the United States has come to an apology for its decade-long defense of Gallo. That year Gallo left the National Institutes of Health for a position at the University of Maryland, but he continued to receive $100,000 annually in royalties for his patented blood test.
	Gallo and his advocates have portrayed him as a flawed, but great, scientist trying to seek truth and save lives while others tormented him with legalistic quibbles. But the Office of Research Integrity asserted in 1993 that Gallo ''seriously hindered progress in AIDS research'' by slighting the French discoveries for so long. His steps to deny the French the United States patent for the blood test, Crewdson suggests, also had dire consequences. Various studies showed that, at least through 1986, Gallo's test was inferior to the Pasteur version; some Americans were infected with AIDS after receiving blood certified as safe by Gallo's test.
