	The suburbs are becoming increasingly diverse as Asian and Hispanic immigrants bypass New York City, traditionally the first stop for new arrivals.
	And among those who commute between the suburbs and New York City, the trend is toward traveling in reverse: from homes in the city to jobs outside it.
	These are among the changes that have taken place across the metropolitan region since 1999, according to an analysis of data released in bits and pieces by the Census Bureau over the last six months.
	A review of the census data and other demographic information for Long Island, three counties in Connecticut, five in the Hudson Valley and 14 in northern and central New Jersey shows that the region is undergoing significant demographic change and other shifts. The data support some commonly held beliefs about income distribution, housing, and commuting.
	For example, the cost of housing is consuming an increasingly higher percentage of household income. When that is coupled with a huge increase in home equity borrowing, a result is that many families are mortgaged to an extent unheard of just a few years ago.
	Also, for most residents of the region's suburbs, taxes are rising faster than income.
