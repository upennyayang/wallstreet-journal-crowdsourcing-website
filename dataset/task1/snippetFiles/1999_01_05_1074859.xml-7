	Another factor was the death last year of Jorge Mas Canosa, the leader of the Cuban American National Foundation and the most vocal and influential anti-Castro Cuban-American political figure in the United States.
	The nature and timing of the announcement also arose in part from a report just completed by the Council on Foreign Relations, published under the signature of two former senior State Department officials. The report proposed essentially similar steps, and some bolder ones, such as granting some American businesses licenses to operate in Cuba and promoting Cuban-American military ties. The council's report said it was intended to ''break the current logjam'' in American policy toward Cuba.
	Under the steps recommended by Ms. Albright, the American embargo against Cuba, imposed 37 years ago, would remain in effect. So would more restrictions added after the pilots were shot down. Individually, some of the changes would be incremental expansions of existing policies on private relief aid to Cuban citizens. Taken together they represent a consensus among top officials that, since the 40-year-old reign of Fidel Castro is likely to end soon, the United States must ''promote a peaceful democratic transition'' by injecting American money, culture and ideas into the isolated island.
