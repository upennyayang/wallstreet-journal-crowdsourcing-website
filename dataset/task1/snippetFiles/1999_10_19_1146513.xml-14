	Mr. Spitzer's approach was reflected in the people he hired.
	To run his environmental bureau, which has 35 lawyers and 7 staff scientists, he recruited Peter H. Lehner, 40, a seasoned environmental lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a large private conservation group.
	Mr. Spitzer, who is 40, had no experience with environmental cases in his previous work as a lawyer and assistant district attorney in Manhattan, he said, and so felt compelled to find an environmental adviser to help shape policy.
	In a move that irritated many people in Governor Pataki's office, Mr. Spitzer chose Judith Enck, 39, a longtime environmental lobbyist in Albany who had been a persistent and outspoken critic of Mr. Pataki's policies. Several people in the Pataki administration, one of whom described Ms. Enck as ''a bomb thrower,'' said the Governor's staff was incredulous that she had been picked to shape Mr. Spitzer's environmental agenda.
	Ms. Enck said that it was difficult for her to consider joining government after so many years of criticizing it, but that she found that she could work for Mr. Spitzer, who came to public office without the baggage that weighs down most elected officials.
