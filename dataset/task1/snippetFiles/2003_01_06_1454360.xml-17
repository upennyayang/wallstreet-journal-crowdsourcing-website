	Many network engineers say that if telephone networks were built from scratch today, they would almost certainly be Internet-based.
	The Net is believed to be more efficient compared with the dedicated circuits of conventional phone networks.
	Executives at some of the largest telecommunications communications companies are planning to make Internet calling part of their business as they seek efficient ways to route some calling. But they expect the technology to catch on at a much slower pace.
	''We have a very reliable telephone system that has worked well for many decades,'' said Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon Communications, the nation's largest local telephone company. ''We see an eventual movement away from the traditional system, but right now it's mainly early-adopter types.''
	As more calls are made through a mix of Internet and conventional methods, pricing is likely to become an issue. Calls over the conventional network -- especially long-distance calls -- have generally been priced on a per-minute basis, while billing for Internet connections is more typically a flat monthly fee. Either system could be changed, although the Bell companies and other giant carriers have an interest in maintaining the pricing for the conventional network.
