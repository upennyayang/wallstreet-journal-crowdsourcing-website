	For polar bear hunters, who are typically wealthy Americans past 50, the trip in a caribou-skin suit on a dog sled is an age-defying passage in a land of disorienting beauty, where the sun does not set for months and nothing but a dreamy blue strip of sky distinguishes ice from cloud.
	For their Inuit guides, the sport hunt is a preserver of tradition and a welcome source of income in snowbound settlements where jobs are almost as scarce as trees.
	''The environmentalists can say no more hunting of polar bears, but we'll keep killing them,'' said David Kalluk, 65, a Resolute village elder. ''That's the way it has been for generations and generations.''
	But while the hunt may be unchanging, the globe's climate is not.
	Global warming and over-hunting could diminish the polar bear population by at least 30 percent in coming decades, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, a network of 10,000 scientists, predicted in May.
	''Given what the climate models predict for continuing warming and melting of sea ice, the whole thing leads to an extinction curve,'' said Peter Ewins, director of the World Wildlife Fund Canada's Arctic Conservation Program.
