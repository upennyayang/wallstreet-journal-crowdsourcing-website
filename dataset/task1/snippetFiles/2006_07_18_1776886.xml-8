	Darwin's finches are at it again. A study by Peter R. Grant and B. Rosemary Grant of Princeton University shows the rapid evolution of beak size in one of the finches in response to competition. The Grants studied the medium ground finch, Geospiza fortis, on the small Gal√°pagos island of Daphne Major. For a long time G. fortis ruled the roost, eating both large and small seeds depending on beak size, but in 1982 a breeding population of the large ground finch, G. magnirostris, arrived. The larger birds eat larger seeds more easily than the smaller birds, even those with bigger beaks. For a long time there were not enough of the larger finches to make much difference. But it was predicted that eventually competition for the larger seeds would put selection pressure on the medium finches toward smaller beak size (because those with smaller beaks would get enough seeds to survive, while those with larger beaks would not). That happened quickly, in 2004, when a drought sharply reduced the food supply. Competition for larger seeds immediately became much more cutthroat, and many of the medium finches with bigger beaks died off, leaving smaller-beaked birds to survive and reproduce and pass along their trait.
