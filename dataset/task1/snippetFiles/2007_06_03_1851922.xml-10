	It wasn't until January 2006, when a presentation by Mr. Keasling at the World Economic Forum in Davos caught the attention of Mr. Doerr and Mr. Khosla, that Amyris's founders began to consider seriously what other compounds their bioengineered bugs might produce. The two venture capitalists encouraged the scientists to think ambitiously.
	''At nights and on weekends we'd been working on what our for-profit projects could be at the end of the Gates grant,'' Mr. Reiling, the company's vice president for development, told me. ''One of those projects was using our engineering know-how to come up with novel biofuels.''
	Mr. Doerr said: ''When I met them, it was truly an open question. Should they work on other pharmaceuticals? Chemicals? And while my passion -- and theirs -- was for fuels and solving global warming, it wasn't at all obvious that they could make a better fuel.''
	Cheap biofuels could eliminate or reduce the use of the fossil fuels whose combustion contributes to climate change. So far, most biofuel ventures have tried to create better ethanol fuels by converting different kinds of ''biomass'' -- everything from corn to sugar cane to switchgrass and jatropha trees -- to fermentable sugars.
