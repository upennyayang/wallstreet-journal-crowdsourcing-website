	Professor Leslie said he thought most people's resistance was in the mind.
	''With current technology, you can't distinguish the difference unless you see the light bulb,'' he said. ''We've done tests.'' Compact fluorescent light bulbs, with their tight twist of tube, look like ray guns, a Saturday night special from another planet. You feel like you're arming the house, not lighting it, when you screw them into the lamps as I did, producing a light on a table that was pleasant, calm and softly clinical, like being across the desk from a Park Avenue doctor.
	Even with fluorescent light's better approximations of incandescence, I wondered if it might need friends in high places -- decorators and designers who would lead the way, as they do in issues of taste in the home.
	Gary Gordon, a lighting designer in New York, has designed lighting for a lot of high-stakes, look-good situations: the art dealer Larry Gagosian's house and galleries; the cosmetics empire Est√©e Lauder's executive offices. Mr. Gordon, who endorses fluorescent light's environmental aspects, said he had used it in the old-school form of long straight tubes.
