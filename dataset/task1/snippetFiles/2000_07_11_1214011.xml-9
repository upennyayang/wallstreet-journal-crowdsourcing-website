	Unlike the ice in a pond, Arctic sea ice consists of independent floes of varying age that join together, pull apart or pile up on one another in reaction to wind and currents. In winter, it extends as far south as Hudson Bay in Canada. By late summer it pulls back to the roughly circular Arctic basin.
	The seeming permanence and impregnability of the northern icescape have given it almost continental status in the human imagination. As a mythic anchor point, the North Pole, home of Santa Claus, has few geographic rivals.
	''The North Pole is the strongest symbol of mankind's struggle against, and with, nature,'' said the Norwegian adventurer Boerge Ousland, the first man to ski there alone without aerial reprovisioning, in 1994. ''If the ice disappears, well, I just can't imagine it.''
	The sea ice is thickest above North America, where Canadian islands and the fingers of northern Greenland act as a sieve in the current. As the floes stack up there, they create pressure ridges up to 40 feet high. By contrast, a branch of the warm-water Gulf Stream keeps Norway's north coast ice-free.
