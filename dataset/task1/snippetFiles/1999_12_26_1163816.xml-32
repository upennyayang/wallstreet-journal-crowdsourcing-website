	One great challenge faced by the restoration architects, Beyer Blinder Belle, will be to avoid making the place look as good as new. ''It's the current frontier of restoration artistry,'' Ms. Gratz said. ''How do you restore without losing the patina of time?''
	For now, there is patina to spare. The sanctuary appears at first glance to be more ragged today than when restoration began. ''There was so much water penetration that it took a couple of years for all of the plaster to fall off,'' Ms. Gratz explained.
	And ornaments like the grand chandelier have been removed. ''I used to say it was held up by a string to God,'' Ms. Gratz said, since it was hard to see how else it was supported by the fragile structure.
	Meanwhile, work that is largely invisible to an untrained eye has prepared the building for more aesthetic improvements.
	MOST important was repointing the brick facade and installing a new slate roof, with skylights, this year. ''They didn't tell me until after it was done that bricks were crumbling in their hands,'' Ms. Gratz said. ''Even I didn't appreciate how tenuous this building was.''
