	Q. What do you want to achieve with the Web site on mad cow disease?
	A. In 1996 the Web was just getting started. I wanted to do a disease Web site that showed how the Internet could be used to do original research based on published information and how it can become the scientific medium of the future. As the paradigm for a disease Web site, madcow carries news and has unlimited space for scientific papers, complex graphics, annotations and interactive models. I would not carry nearly so much news on the Web site if the news would only let up.
	Q. Who visits the Web site on mad cow disease?
	A. It's a meeting ground for scientists from all over the world. The Web site is a place where they can place a research paper after it's been accepted for publication. But instead of waiting six months for it to appear in print, they can share information right away, unless the journal in question objects, which most do not. It's also a place where families can get help. My dad died from a dementia at age 80, so I can relate to what people are going through.
