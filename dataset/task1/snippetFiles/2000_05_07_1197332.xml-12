	Q: So as opposed to opening up other possibilities, you feel that having gotten those kind of basic surprises out of the way lessens the possibilities for what can be discussed in therapy?
	Kramer: I think that one of the great jobs of psychotherapy is to create a place where very shameful aspects of the self can safely be revealed. So I think it lessens the force of revelation that so much is already revealed.
	Martin S. Bergmann: Cultural changes do in some way affect what patients talk about. To give an example, I have had experience with patients who develop cancer or other disabling diseases and then look upon themselves as ''damaged goods.'' Now, to me, ''damaged goods'' is a very typical American way to look at oneself, in commercial terms. For example, ''My child is a high-maintenance kid.'' That is also along the same lines.
	Kramer: I think it's obvious at this moment that therapy also needs to be a refuge from the commercial society. There's something about the ubiquity of value.
	Q: And this is a recent development?
	Kramer: I don't know, I think there's always a temptation to believe it's a recent development.
