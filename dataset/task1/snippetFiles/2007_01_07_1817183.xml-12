	Gary Gordon, a lighting designer in New York, has designed lighting for a lot of high-stakes, look-good situations: the art dealer Larry Gagosian's house and galleries; the cosmetics empire Est√©e Lauder's executive offices. Mr. Gordon, who endorses fluorescent light's environmental aspects, said he had used it in the old-school form of long straight tubes. But he's not a particular fan of compact fluorescent bulbs. ''Because of their small tube diameter, there's a limit to the quality of color rendering that can be packed into the tube, so they're not too flattering to the skin,'' he said of how they light people -- light's most critical arena. Big, big problem. (Mr. Gordon has consulted professionally with Royal Philips, the light-bulb manufacturer, to try to solve it.) ''People don't look too healthy,'' he explained. ''Human beings base their well-being on how others appear, to establish how we feel about ourselves.'' In other words, you're not O.K., I'm not O.K.. Though as Professor Leslie at the Lighting Research Center has demonstrated, people can't pick out the type of light a lamp is producing without seeing the bulb, seeing skin in its light is a giveaway.
