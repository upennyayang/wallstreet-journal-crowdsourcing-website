	Finally, down Tiffany Street, we find the Tiffany Street Pier, a recently remodeled municipal pier where Mr. Governali occasionally meets his fellow treasure hunters if he does not feel like going to Long Island. There is no docking access, so he simply ''jumps down into'' the boat. The pier is closed for the winter. To the right, however, is a remarkably open patch of landscape.
	We descend upon the sand and rocks. Before us lie the churning waters of Hell Gate, the turbulent confluence of the Harlem and East Rivers. Looming through the haze are the squat buildings and razor wire of Rikers Island. To the right, on North Brother Island, are the ruins of the hospital that once housed Typhoid Mary. Mr. Governali, standing astride a rock, points to a crumpled folding chair nearby.
	''Lloyd, look!'' he shouts. ''I found the chair where the captain sat on the Hussar.''
	Returning to the car, a woman waiting out the rain in an adjacent vehicle looks at Mr. Governali, a waterfront noir figure wearing a fedora and raincoat with raised collar. ''He must be some kind of movie star or something,'' she cackles.
