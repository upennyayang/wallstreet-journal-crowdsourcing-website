	Scientists have not been able to determine whether the crabs, which eat just about anything, will cause any significant environmental or economic damage. But one thing is sure: They are here to stay.
	''There's nothing you can do about them,'' Mr. Kraemer said. ''Just look at the sheer numbers. It would be impossible to get rid of them.''
	The crabs are found along the rocky shore on the north and south shores of Long Island, said Robert M. Cerrato, an associate professor in the Marine Sciences Research Center at Stony Brook University. At Crane Neck Point in Brookhaven, N.Y., there used to be a large population of blue mussels, Mr. Cerrato said, but suddenly last fall there were hardly any left.
	''Whether it could happen naturally or the crabs got in there, I can't say for sure,'' he said. ''But these are the kinds of things that could potentially take place.''
	Asian shore crabs are just the latest of many nonnative invasive species to arrive in United States waters.
	Such invasions worry scientists like Mr. Carlton, who has been trying to persuade Congress to strengthen laws regarding the release of ballast water by cargo ships in coastal waters.
