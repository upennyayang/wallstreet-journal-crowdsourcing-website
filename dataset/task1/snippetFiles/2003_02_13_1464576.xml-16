	A. We're happy to hear those comments and any other views from anybody inside or external to the agency to come to ground troops and find the answers to what happened in this case. Absolutely, senator. . . .
	REPRESENTATIVE BOEHLERT: Mr. Administrator, I want to thank you very much. Before we wrap up, I just want to touch on a couple of more points. I want to bring clarity to a very important issue. I think it should be self-evident that the Congress is committee to the proposition, on a bipartisan, bicameral basis, that we need to strengthen the evidence supporting the assertion that the Columbia accident investigation board is truly independent. I know the message has been sent and I think it's been received, and I know it's been heard. And I want some assurance that it'll be heeded. So I'd like you to visit that a little bit more and comment. I carefully listened to you as you said you will consult with Admiral Gehman, but I hope you're hearing what Congress is saying. We are the ones -- and others, too -- insisting that we get some clarity to this issue.
