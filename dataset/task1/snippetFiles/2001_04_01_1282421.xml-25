	''I think this guy's an architect,'' Rodriguez said of Hicks. ''He built a world champion in hockey, he's built a world championship in business and I think he'll do the same thing here.''
	It was obvious, Rodriguez was told, that he and Hicks impressed each other. ''I don't know about me with him,'' he replied, ''but I know he did to me. When I saw him, I thought George Steinbrenner II. This guy has the same desire and hunger. He's driven by winning. He told me: 'Hey, I already have a hockey championship. I want a baseball championship.' That kind of got my juices going.''
	Rodriguez forevermore will be known not by his uniform number, 3, but by 252. His new teammates, however, say the contract has not affected them.
	''No one has said anything about his money, not one,'' Rafael Palmeiro said. ''He makes a lot of money and deservedly. We just want him to play well and help us win, regardless of how much money he makes.''
	When the Mets ended negotiations for Rodriguez before they started, their general manager, Steve Phillips, talked about his concern that Rodriguez would create a 24-and-1 clubhouse scenario.
