	The technology, he said, though now central to brain science, ''is in one sense disappointing, in that so far it has told us nothing more than what a neurologist of the 19th century could have told you about brain functions and where they're localized.'' And that may be where the hazard lies. The brain's increasingly popular image is a fascinating prop, a colorful as well as useful map, but so far it provides only the illusion of depth. The subtle biology that integrates and coordinates disparate areas of the brain, like the visual, the verbal and the emotional -- the interlocking symphonies of activity that make us individuals, that help determine what we do when jealous or inspired by a work of art -- are absent, despite all the color-coding and exotic names for areas of the brain. ''The risk is that seeing the neural activity allows people to take away or excuse responsibility for a behavior -- to take away the individual person,'' said Dr. Brown of the Einstein School of Medicine. But she could not elaborate. A camera crew from CNN was due to arrive, to talk to her about the brain in love. IDEAS &amp; TRENDS
