	''I understood his comment that he wished to be understood as an individual speaking, rather than as president, but I doubt that everyone who listened to the speech or read it will be able to make that distinction,'' Mr. Abdul-Basser said. ''And I was saddened to see that evidently support of the divestment campaign was being equated with something as ugly as anti-Semitism. Some of the professors who supported the campaign said they saw a difference between the two, and I certainly do, too.''
	While Mr. Summers strongly rejected divestment, he affirmed the value of open debate and said he was not taking sides.
	''There is much to be debated about the Middle East and much in Israel's foreign and defense policy that can be and should be vigorously challenged,'' he said in his speech.
	Those caveats, however, did not persuade critics like Elizabeth Spelke, a psychology professor who also signed the divestiture petition.
	''Labeling the petition anti-Semitic is a strategy to detract from the criticisms of Israel,'' Professor Spelke said. ''It turns the substance of a political debate into a debate of morals and supposed racism.''
