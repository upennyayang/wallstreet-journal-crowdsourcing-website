	When eating finally became so unpleasant that he was reduced to swigging down high-nutrition supplements, Dr. Fowler sought help from a colleague, Dr. Linda Bartoshuk, a Yale University psychologist specializing in the study of taste. In Dr. Bartoshuk's lab, Dr. Fowler's cranial nerves were tested for taste and for pain, his tongue was painted with blue food coloring and videotaped in action, his ability to smell turpentine, coffee and other odors was tested, and a thorough examination was conducted of his mouth, including the fungiform pappilae, the structures that house taste buds, on his tongue. Then Dr. Bartoshuk delivered her diagnosis: the burning sensations and mysterious tastes, she told him, were sensory phantoms, his brain's response to damage to the chorda tympani, a branch of the VII cranial nerve that serves taste buds in the front of the tongue, runs through the middle ear, and carries taste messages to the brain. The damage, Dr. Bartoshuk said, was probably temporary, and might be the result of a medicine Dr. Fowler was taking, or a viral infection. And a few months later his sense of taste did return to normal.
