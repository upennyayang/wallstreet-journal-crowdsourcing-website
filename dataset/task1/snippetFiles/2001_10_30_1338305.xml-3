	In graduate school at Stanford, Dr. McWhorter became fascinated with the evolution of languages, particularly with the Creole tongues, because he wondered how a phenomenon like Haitian Creole ''could start out as Latin'' and ''become something so different in structure.''
	Q. In ''The Power of Babel,'' you write, ''The first human language emerged roughly 150,000 years ago in East Africa.'' How can you know this?
	A. To some extent, language appears to be innate to Homo sapiens. The fossil evidence of Homo sapiens goes back to about 150,000 years ago. So we may assume that part of what distinguished the species when it arose was speech.
	Q. What sorts of words, do you suppose, were a part of the vocabulary of early humans? Did they say, ''Herd of antelope, over there'' or ''The fire is warm''?
	A. The first vocabulary must have corresponded closely with the life experience of the people in question. Since they were most likely hunter-gatherers, they would certainly have had words for animals and plants. If you look at contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, we find their vocabularies correspond closely to their life experiences.
