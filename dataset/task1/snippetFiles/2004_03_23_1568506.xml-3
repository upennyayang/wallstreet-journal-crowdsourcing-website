	In the study, by scientists at Harvard and the University of Texas at San Antonio, college students were asked to choose someone they knew and then either concentrate on or suppress thoughts about that person five minutes before bedtime. Another group of students was told simply to pick a person and then to think about anything at all.
	Psychologists have argued about thought suppression and dream interpretation for decades, though few researchers have put the theories to the test.
	''Not surprisingly, any kind of thinking about something increases the likelihood that it will show up in a dream,'' said Dr. Daniel M. Wegner, a professor of psychology at Harvard and the lead author of the study. ''But trying to suppress something increases the chances even more, indicating that the meanings of our dreams involve things we've tried to sweep under the rug.''
	The study is being published in the April issue of the journal Psychological Science.
	The findings seem to fall in line with the idea that dreams express complicated desires and unfulfilled wishes, as Freud, who called dreams the ''royal road to the unconscious,'' noted long ago. But Dr. Wegner does not completely agree with that assertion.
