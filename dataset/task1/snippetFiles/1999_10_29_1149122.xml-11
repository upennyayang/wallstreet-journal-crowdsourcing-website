	''It's going to really change our view of what the most ancestral type of flowering plant was like,'' Dr. Olmstead said.
	Each team of researchers took a slightly different approach to determining the family tree of flowering plants and pinpointing its most ancient groups. Dr. Olmstead and Dr. Graham studied a large number of slowly evolving genes. Dr. Douglas Soltis and Dr. Pamela Soltis, a husband and wife team at Washington State University, and their colleagues looked at fewer genes but studied those genes in a wide variety of plants.
	And in research described in today's Science article, Dr. Sarah Mathews and Dr. Michael Donoghue of Harvard University used a new technique to look into the group's history. The researchers studied a gene that had duplicated itself into two copies in the earliest flowering plants, providing two independent road maps to the evolution of the group -- maps that, as the researchers expected, turned out to be very similar.
	The scientists say the new findings do not indicate which nonflowering plant sprouted earth's first flower. And, while nearly all researchers have enthusiastically accepted the new work, a few have sounded cautionary notes over the answer to this question, which has been so problematic in the past.
