	If the Americans stop coming, the guides say, they will seek other foreign hunters or kill the entire quota for themselves.
	Demand is already pent up. Outfitters who organize the hunting trips say there is a three-year waiting list for Americans who want to go.
	Hunters say few experiences can compare with the sensation of sighting a bear, then watching the Inuit guides release their huskies to surround and confuse the prey long enough for the hunters to shoot it.
	''This is my Disney World,'' said Manuel Camacho, a 60-year-old urologist from Miami, before he set out on his hunt in May.
	Once on the ice, the hunt can be suspended for days at a time by frosty fog. There is little to do but drink instant coffee, eat macaroni and cheese, and doze off on a shedding caribou skin. The silence is broken only by the soft howl of a sled dog or the hum of a gas stove.
	The landscape is stark, yet awesome. The lack of color -- or anything -- makes even the smallest sight exhilarating: a black dot in the distance (a seal popping out of the ice), a wolf track, the passing of a raven, or a mother bear rambling with her cub.
