	Federal lawyers, in tandem with those of the automobile industry, are arguing that existing law is inadequate to support far-reaching regulation and that Congress or the foreign policy arena, or both, are the appropriate places to produce new global warming policies.
	Calling the case ''the most pressing environmental case in decades,'' Massachusetts's attorney general, Thomas F. Reilly, said, ''The most indisputable fact in this case is that our climate is changing and that change is being caused by dangerous greenhouse-gas emissions.''
	He added, ''The federal government's willing suspension of belief when it comes to global climate change has left it to the states to stand up and force action.''
	But, lawyers on both sides of the issue agree, the justices' answers to a more basic question -- whether the plaintiffs have a right to bring the case -- may have the greatest ramifications.
	In deciding that issue, known legally as a question of standing, the justices may determine whether Massachusetts and its fellow petitioners have made a good enough case that the atmosphere and oceans are warming at a dangerous rate, fueled in part by human actions like burning fossil fuels, and that the petitioners have been harmed in the process.
