	Meanwhile, the number of Mexicans in New York City tripled during the 1990's to nearly 187,000, according to the 2000 census. The number of Ecuadoreans rose by nearly 30 percent, to 101,000. Other large groups include Colombians, Peruvians and Central Americans.
	''Language is a window into people's views of themselves vis-a-vis the dominant group and vis-a-vis the other groups that they're often lumped with,'' said Professor Zentella, who, with a Puerto Rican mother and a Mexican father, grew up knowing that words like frijoles and habichuelas expressed more than beans.
	''People will often use their particular regional variety of Spanish as a flag, emblematic of their national origin,'' she said. ''But there are other times in which they refer to Spanish as the unifier of a much larger, disparate group of people across different class and ethnic and national backgrounds.''
	Professor Zentella describes herself as ''an anthropolitical linguist'' who studies what happens when people from different groups converge. Among other things, she has studied Spanglish, which she sees as ''a way of making a graphic statement about having a foot in both cultural worlds.''
