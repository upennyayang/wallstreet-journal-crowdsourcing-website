	''I think it's the technology that's going to take us to Mars,'' said Dr. Franklin Chang-Diaz, a shuttle astronaut and director of the Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Instead of relying on chemical reactions like conventional rockets, Dr. Chang-Diaz's creation, the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, or Vasimr, uses radio waves to heat the fuel and magnetic fields to direct a stream of ultrahot ionized gases. NASA last week announced that it was collaborating with MSE Technology Applications of Butte, Mont., to develop the Vasimr technology, still years away from use in space. MSE is creating computer models for shaping the magnetic fields that form the engine's nozzle. Space buffs have long dreamed of sending astronauts to Mars. But that dream, which once looked like the next destination after Moon landings, is still far from reality, stymied by hurdles as much economic and political as technological. By the early 1950's, the pioneering rocket scientist Wernher von Braun had already worked out a detailed, if fanciful, plan for sending a fleet of 10 colossal spaceships to Mars, powered by conventional chemical rockets.
