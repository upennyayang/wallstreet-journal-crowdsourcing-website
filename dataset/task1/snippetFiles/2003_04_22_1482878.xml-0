	Mating of a Flasher
	Consider the lamentable situation of the typical male firefly. It has only a couple of weeks to find a mate before it dies, and precious little, save its lantern, for attracting one. It can't preen like a peacock or strut like a turkey (or drive around in a Lamborghini like a male Homo sapiens). It can only flash on and off every few seconds.
	But that simple flash, it turns out, can speak volumes. A study by biologists at Tufts University shows that in one firefly species, mating preferences are based in part on the duration of the flash. Simply put, females make passes at males with longer flashes.
	The researchers, Dr. Christopher K. Cratsley and Dr. Sara M. Lewis, studied Photinus ignitus, a firefly that graces New England lawns in the early summer.
	They timed the duration of males' flashes -- from 56 to 123 milliseconds -- and, by using a light-emitting diode to make precise simulated flashes, showed that females responded more (with a return flash of their own) as the flashes became longer.
	The work was published in the January-February issue of Behavioral Ecology.
