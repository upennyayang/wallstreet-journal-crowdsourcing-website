	Now, at a glance under a simple light microscope, researchers can tell whether a graphite flake is more than 100 layers thick (yellow), 30 to 40 layers thick (blue), about 10 layers thick (pink) or just a single-layer (pale, almost invisible, pink).
	Dr. Geim said he thought the earlier researchers -- and indeed, anyone who has written with a pencil -- was likely to have produced graphene but simply could not see it.
	After researchers had an easy way to make graphene, they started playing with all types of experiments. Techniques borrowed from silicon technology allow them to cut graphene into specific shapes, constructing transistors and other electronic devices. They face years of challenges. The ragged edges can affect the devices' properties, though they also offer the possibility of tuning the electronics by attaching various atoms at the edges.
	Scientists have also explored more esoteric aspects of graphene, including a prediction from more than half a century ago. Because of how the electrons flowing in graphene interact with the honeycomb chicken-wire structure, they behave as if they have no mass, always traveling at the same speed regardless of their energy, like particles of light.
