	It was the beginning of what Dr. Susskind calls an adversarial relationship. ''Stephen Hawking is one of the most obstinate people in the world; no, he is the most infuriating person in the universe,'' Dr. Susskind told the birthday workshop, as Dr. Hawking grinned in the back row.
	In the ensuing 20 years, opinions have split mostly along party lines. Particle physicists like Dr. Susskind and Dr. Gerard 't Hooft, a physicist at the University of Utrecht and the 1999 Nobel Prize winner, defend quantum theory and say that the information must get out somehow, perhaps subtly encoded in the radiation. Another possibility -- that the information was left behind in some new kind of elementary particle when the black hole evaporated -- seems to have fallen from favor.
	Relativity experts like Dr. Hawking and his friend the Caltech physicist Dr. Kip Thorne were more likely to believe in the power of black holes to keep secrets. In 1997, Dr. Hawking and Dr. Thorne put their money where the black hole mouth was, betting Dr. John Preskill, a Caltech particle physicist, a set of encyclopedias that information was destroyed in a black hole.
