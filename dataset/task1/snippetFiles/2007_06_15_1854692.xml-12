	''Could there be another cause? Not to my knowledge,'' said Bailes, adding that Strzelczyk's car crash could not have caused the C.T.E. tangles. Bailes also said that bipolar disorder, signs of which Strzelczyk appeared to be increasingly exhibiting in the months before his death, would not be caused, but perhaps could be exacerbated, by the encephalopathy.
	Omalu and Bailes said Strzelczyk's diagnosis is particularly notable because the condition manifested itself when he was in his mid-30s. The other players were 44 to 50 -- several decades younger than what would be considered normal for their conditions -- when they died: Long and Waters by suicide and Webster of a heart attack amid significant psychological problems.
	Two months ago, Omalu examined the brain tissue of one other deceased player, the former Denver Broncos running back Damien Nash, who died in February at 24 after collapsing following a charity basketball game. (A Broncos spokesman said that the cause of death has yet to be identified.) Omalu said he was not surprised that Nash showed no evidence of C.T.E. because the condition could almost certainly not develop in someone that young. ''This is a progressive disease,'' he said.
