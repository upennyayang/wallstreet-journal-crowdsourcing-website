	Yet Mr. Haggard worried that on the Internet, anyone could come on as a religious authority -- ''even a crazy person.'' He added that because there was so much pornography on the Internet, online evangelism might prove a mixed benefit. ''We have more people corrupted on the Internet than we have arrive at the church by the Net,'' he said.
	In Vancouver, British Columbia, Karen Schenk works both direct and indirect approaches to evangelism. She is the director of Web site strategies for TruthMedia, an organization of 20 sites affiliated with Campus Crusade for Christ, an evangelical group. Two sites she oversees are www.womentodayonline.com and www.christianwomentoday.com.
	The latter assumes visitors are already involved in churches, she said, and offers articles like ''Dive Deeper Into God'' and ''True Spiritual Change.'' The former is for women who might not be Christians, and features articles like ''I Am Jealous of His Very Attractive Ex-Wife.''
	It is the secular-looking site that is evangelistic, Mrs. Schenk said. ''We're just being sensitive to where people are at and inviting them in. We don't have spinning crosses on Women Today.''
