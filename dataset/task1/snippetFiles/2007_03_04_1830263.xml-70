	''I knew I couldn't be a novelist,'' said Wilson, who crackled with intensity during a telephone interview, ''so I chose something as far as possible from literature -- I chose science.'' He is disarmingly honest about what motivated him: ''I was very ambitious, and I wanted to make a mark.'' He chose to study human evolution, he said, in part because he had some of his father's literary leanings and the field required a novelist's attention to human motivations, struggles and alliances -- as well as a novelist's flair for narrative.
	Wilson eventually chose to study religion not because religion mattered to him personally -- he was raised in a secular Protestant household and says he has long been an atheist -- but because it was a lens through which to look at and revivify a branch of evolution that had fallen into disrepute. When Wilson was a graduate student at Michigan State University in the 1970s, Darwinians were critical of group selection, the idea that human groups can function as single organisms the way beehives or anthills do. So he decided to become the man who rescued this discredited idea.
