	''Because clean air, pure water and adequate resources are crucial to public health and civic order,'' the statement said, ''government has an obligation to protect its citizens from the effects of environmental degradation.''
	Nearly 100 evangelical leaders have signed the statement.
	But it is far from certain that a more focused statement on climate change would elicit a similar response.
	In recent years, however, whenever the association latched onto a new issue, Washington paid attention, on questions like religious persecution, violence in Sudan, AIDS in Africa and sex trafficking of young girls.
	Environmentalists said they would welcome the evangelicals as allies.
	''They have good friendships in places where the rest of the environmental community doesn't,'' Larry J. Schweiger, president and chief executive of the National Wildlife Federation, said. ''For instance, in legislative districts where there's a very conservative lawmaker who might not be predisposed to pay attention to what environmental groups might say, but may pay attention to what the local faith community is saying.''
	It is not as if the evangelical and environmental groups are collaborating, because the wedge between them remains deep, Mr. Cizik said.
	Over the last three years, evangelical leaders like Mr. Cizik have begun to reconsider their silence on environmental questions.
