	They work in a cluttered warren of cubicles in the back office of a research organization here, two former Russian journalists and a Chinese colleague. Three times a week, they e-mail a snappy digest of American news called Washington ProFile to more than 20,000 Russian-language subscribers in more than 100 countries -- and to a like number once a week in Chinese.
	Their annual budget? About $350,000. Subscription price? Free. Estimated readership? Tens of millions, from individual editors and academics, to readers of Izvestia and scores of smaller newspapers throughout the former Soviet Union, China and Taiwan, all drawn to Washington ProFile's no-nonsense mix of interviews, news analysis articles and lifestyle features in places where reliable Western news in the local language is scarce at best.
	''It's not just news,'' said Bruce Blair, a veteran arms-control expert and the president of the Center for Defense Information, a national security research organization that has sponsored the service since the fall of 2001. ''It's information and explanation and analysis.''
	The Russian Web search engine Aport lists Washington ProFile as the second-most cited American-based news agency in the Russian mass media, after CNN.
