	Novitzky's latest case involves Kirk Radomski, a former Mets clubhouse assistant who pleaded guilty Friday to supplying performance-enhancing drugs to dozens of current and former Major League Baseball players and their associates, and laundering the proceeds from those transactions.
	Novitzky signed an affidavit on Dec. 13, 2005, filed in conjunction with a search the next day on Radomski's Long Island home. After that raid, Radomski immediately began helping federal investigators look into drug use in baseball. In that affidavit, Novitzky wrote that he had written affidavits in support of search warrants ''on 35 different locations'' during his 13 years with the I.R.S. Criminal Investigation Unit.
	Less than six months later, Novitzky signed another affidavit, that one to search the home of the journeyman pitcher Jason Grimsley. Novitzky said it was his 39th affidavit in support of search warrants, meaning that there had been three other affidavits filed -- and likely three other searches of homes or businesses -- between the Radomski and the Grimsley searches. The Radomski and Grimsley affidavits are the only two that have been unsealed by courts.
	In a telephone call yesterday, Novitzky declined to comment on the investigation because it was continuing.
