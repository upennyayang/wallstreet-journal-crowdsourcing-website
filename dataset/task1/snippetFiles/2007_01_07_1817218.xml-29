	He rarely looks angry or thrilled, a nonchalance that has been interpreted by critics as a lack of passion. He does not believe in showing up teammates by screaming or gesturing. He does not believe there is a benefit to celebrating touchdowns with a wild downfield sprint.

	''Eli's a young kid still,'' Barber said.
