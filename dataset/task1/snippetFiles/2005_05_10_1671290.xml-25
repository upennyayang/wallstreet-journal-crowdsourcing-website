	A. I'm dismayed. I teach evolution in a basic undergraduate course at U.C.L.A. If you're a psychology major, you have to take it. The religious students try to argue with me! I've had a Muslim tell me that evolution wasn't in his religious texts so it couldn't be true. I had a young Christian woman in tears at the end of the term: ''You convinced me. And now what am I going to do?'' She lived in a small town where evangelical religion played a big role. To doubt Genesis was almost like holding immoral beliefs. I felt strange because I'd made her life a lot more difficult by convincing her of what I considered to be true. But there was no help for it. Q. A new version of creationism, ''intelligent design,'' is being pushed by the anti-Darwinists. It says more or less that the world is too complicated to be an accident. Do your students cite it? A. Not just my students. ''Intelligent design'' seems to be creationism stripped of its explicitly Christian biblical background, and so it has wider appeal.
