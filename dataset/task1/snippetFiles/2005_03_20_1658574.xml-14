	But others think there's no problem. Norman Fost, the director of the medical ethics program at the University of Wisconsin who has long said that the danger of steroids are overstated, similarly sees nothing wrong with taking drugs like Ritalin or Provigil solely to enhance performance.
	''We all would like to do better at what we're doing, whether athletic or intellectual or musical,'' he said. ''There's nothing inherently immoral about performance enhancement. It's what everyone does, or would try to do, for their children. We shouldn't be obsessed with the fact that it's a drug, as if it's a drug like cocaine or heroin.''
	Dr. Caplan mocks the handwringing over self-enhancement drugs. To him, it is all technology: ''The lawyer who's taking a pill to stay up is also carrying a computer or P.D.A. to help his brain remember things. Are we going to throw away our calculators?''
	Certainly, there is no guarantee that performance enhancement delivers happiness.
	As Ms. Pope notes, at the same time stimulants like Ritalin are becoming more popular among high school students, college campuses are reporting a new drug of choice.
