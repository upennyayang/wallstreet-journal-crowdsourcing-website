	The study, described in the Sept. 14 issue of the journal Science, finds that the two dilemmas engage different parts of the brain. The idea of throwing a switch is impersonal; it is processed by a part of the brain that deals mainly with memory. By contrast, the notion of personally pushing a stranger to his death activates the part of the brain that deals with emotions, temporarily suppressing the memory areas.
	Dr. Jonathan Cohen of Princeton, a psychologist and expert on brain imaging who worked on the study, says it begins to provide tools to understand why people with different cultural backgrounds can arrive at different conclusions about moral dilemmas, like taking a life for some greater good. If people's gut-level emotions are organized differently as a result of their backgrounds, he said, they may reason differently about what is right or wrong.
	Experts say the findings may be useful to philosophers as well. While moral philosophy deals with ethics and logic rather than emotion and biology, Dr. Stephen Stich, a professor of philosophy and cognitive science at Rutgers, says that in the real world people have feelings about life-and-death issues.
