	FIRST, a disclosure: Dr. Terry Marx, New York City's first chief physician for school health, was more than a little reluctant to report for duty this week.
	Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, her friend and former neighbor on the Upper West Side, cajoled her into accepting the job, supervising and trying to improve the scattershot health care programs offered in the city's 1,100 public schools.
	But Dr. Marx, a pediatrician, was skittish about leaving her job as a supervising physician at four school health clinics in Washington Heights. At the clinics, run by New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University's School of Public Health, Dr. Marx treated everything from sore throats and anxiety attacks to chronic asthma and seizures. She immunized students, checked their vision and, when necessary, referred them for psychotherapy.
	Yet she heeded Mr. Levy's call, because, she said, the schools chancellor ''sees the link between health care and learning and has the political will to do something about it.''
	So, beginning this week, Dr. Marx will report to a 10th-floor office at 110 Livingston Street, the Board of Education headquarters. She will work two and a half days a week and earn $75,000 a year.
