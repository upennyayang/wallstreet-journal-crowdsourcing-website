	But no one had specifically stated the idea in those terms, as far as Dr. Tsien knew. And certainly no one had done the obvious experiment, which was to engineer mice in which the NR2B gene was artificially put into hyperdrive to see if their memories improved.
	So Dr. Tsien took a copy of the mouse NR2B gene and linked it to a special piece of DNA, called a promoter, that is active only in cells of the mouse forebrain. He injected this genetic fragment into fertilized mouse eggs, where it added itself to the mouse's normal complement of genes. Because of the promoter, the NR2B gene was active in cells of the forebrain, adding its product to that produced by the mouse's own NR2B gene.
	With all the extra NR2B being produced in the mice's brain cells, the NMDA receptors underwent a subtle but significant change. Instead of staying open for 100 thousandths of a second, as they do in normal mice, the receptor's interval increased to 250 thousandths of a second.
	That minute biophysical change, Dr. Tsien says, is what underlies the superior learning skills of the mice.
