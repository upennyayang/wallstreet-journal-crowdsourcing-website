	The study found a small, but statistically significant, improvement in contrast sensitivity and glare reduction for participants who wore the eye grease, but not for those who wore antiglare stickers. The results were published in 2003 in Archives of Ophthalmology.
	''I thought we would find it to be like war paint and a psychological advantage more than anything else,'' Dr. Brian M. DeBroff, the lead author of the Yale study, said in a telephone interview. ''We were surprised to find a benefit from the grease.''
	Asked if the benefits were significant enough to enhance athletic performance, Dr. DeBroff said, ''Certainly in football and baseball, where tracking a ball at high speed is an important aspect, any competitive advantage could be beneficial.''
	He added: ''Does it translate in terms of being able to pick up the ball if looking back into the sun? Possibly. Certainly, it would be interesting to do further study to determine the exact benefit.''
	A study of eye-black grease at the University of New Hampshire also found a small improvement in contrast sensitivity. The findings, published last year in an undergraduate research journal, were considered preliminary, said Dr. Kenneth Fuld, chairman of the university's psychology department and the study's sponsor.
