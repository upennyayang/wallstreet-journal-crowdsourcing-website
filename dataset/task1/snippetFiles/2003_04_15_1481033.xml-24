	The Human Genome Project was originally projected to cost a total of $3 billion. Money spent by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy since the beginning of the project has come to $2.7 billion, but that does not include spending by the Sanger Institute and other foreign collaborators.
	The total spending of the Human Genome Project includes pilot projects like sequencing the roundworm and fruit fly genomes. No exact figure was given at today's press conference for sequencing the human genome specifically. But the Sanger Institute has spent 150 million pounds, or about $235 million, to sequence 30 percent of the genome, and on that basis would have required 500 million pounds, or $786 million at the current rate of exchange, to do all of it.
	Though the Human Genome Project has been declared completed, the genome sequencing centers will not go out of business. They have switched to decoding the genomes of other species, and to exploring variations in the human genome.
	Obtaining the sequence of the human genome is a first step. Biologists must now annotate it, or identify the regions of DNA that hold the genes and their control elements.
