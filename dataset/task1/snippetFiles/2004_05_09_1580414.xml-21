	Others take a more pragmatic approach to the newly available information about how the brain works. In his recent book, ''Mind Wide Open: Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life'' (Scribner), Steven Johnson undergoes a barrage of neurological tests to learn more about his own quirks. ''For a long time when scientists talked about the brain it was, 'the human brain functions this way,''' Mr. Johnson said. ''But the great promise of this moment is that we can begin to understand what makes us different as well as what makes us all alike. Enough about the human race -- I want to hear about me.''
	Mr. Johnson, who found himself to be better at language than visual processing, said his wife used to get annoyed when he couldn't recall details about a house they were planning to renovate. Now, he says, they understand that she is better at visual tasks, and he tries harder to compensate.
	Many of those who advocate greater tolerance for brain quirks caution that it should not serve as an excuse for individuals to behave inappropriately. ''It's not a get-out-of-jail-free card,'' Dr. Ratey said.
	The answer, increasingly, may be ''not.''
