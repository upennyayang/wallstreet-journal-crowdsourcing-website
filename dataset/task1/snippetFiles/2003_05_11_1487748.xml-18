	As all this happened, Don trawled for answers online. He read about things like amphotericin B and flupirtine -- lethal drugs that had never been proven but that scientists somewhere had infused with speculative hope. Don's own hopes became focused on one Stephen Dealler, a maverick researcher who had been warning the British government about mad cow for more than a decade. Long before the disease appeared in humans, Dealler, who is now with the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, predicted that it was only a matter of time. ''I kept saying we have to find a cure for this in humans,'' he recalls. ''But they wanted proof that the horse had bolted before they would shut the door.'' In the early 1990's, Dealler learned that a chemical called pentosan polysulphate, or PPS -- which is used to treat bladder inflammation -- had shown some effectiveness against scrapie, a prion disease that affects animals very much as mad cow does. Researchers showed that if an animal was given PPS before, or very soon after infection -- the timing would prove to be significant -- it could prevent the disease from taking hold. Dealler and his colleagues showed that the drug was similarly effective against variant C.J.D.
