	Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said the new study had been hyped adding, ''We have many concerns about it on many levels.''
	Another group, Breast Cancer Action, said, ''We are very concerned that treating risk as a medical condition will result in substituting one disease for another.''
	The study included nearly 20,000 women 35 and older who were past menopause and had an increased risk of developing breast cancer. To qualify, their risk had to be at least that of an average 60- to 64-year-old woman -- a 1.66 percent chance of getting the disease within 5 years. On average, the participants actually had more than twice that risk, around 4 percent, meaning that 40 of 1,000 would be affected. (Women can quickly figure out their own risk at the Web site cancer.gov/bcrisktool).
	Half the participants took one drug, and half the other for about five years. Their rates of invasive breast cancer were the same, 163 cases for tamoxifen and 167 for raloxifene -- about half as many as would have been expected without treatment.
	So raloxifene looked just as good as tamoxifen.
	But numbers can be tricky.
