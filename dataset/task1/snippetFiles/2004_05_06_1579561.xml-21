	Larry Soler, a lobbyist for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, said the organization concluded last year that the policy was not working. So in the fall of 2003, he said, the group began encouraging patients and their families to meet with members of Congress. Their argument: ''This is not a political issue. This is an issue that transcends politics.''
	Lawmakers have found the patients difficult to resist. Among those who signed onto the letter circulated in the House were Deborah Pryce of Ohio, the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, Bill Thomas, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, as well as Mr. Rohrabacher, whose aides met with Dan Rodriguez, a Los Angeles firefighter, his wife and two daughters, one of whom has diabetes.
	Mr. Rodriguez said that when he visited the Rohrabacher office in 2001, ''they weren't too sure on the stem-cell issue.'' But the aide remembered him, and this year the congressman signed on.
	''We were thrilled,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''You hear a lot of negatives about government, but if you go and talk to your congressman or senator, they listen.''
