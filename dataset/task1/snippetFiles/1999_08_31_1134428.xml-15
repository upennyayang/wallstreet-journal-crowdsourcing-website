	Next, check whether the information is based on reports published in leading medical journals. If all the references are to foreign or obscure publications you never heard of, be suspicious. And, of course, if there are no references, the statements may be based more on opinion than on fact.
	Try to assess the objectivity and comprehensiveness of the information presented. Keep in mind that there is no way to stop someone from posing as a medical expert and dispensing erroneous advice. How many opinions does the advice reflect? A reliable source is likely to present various perspectives on a health matter. No one organization has all the answers, and even reputable sources reflect opinions that may be disputed by other experts.
	Is the information current? A Web site on health should be updated monthly and should state the date of the most recent update.
	Don't believe everything you read. Maintain a healthy skepticism. Check out Internet advice with your doctor, and don't start taking remedies recommended on the Web without first consulting your doctor.
	Be very careful about the growing practice of on-line medicine.
	Last but not least, Jeanne C. Ryer, author of ''Health Net'' (Wiley, 1997), urges, ''Use your common sense.
