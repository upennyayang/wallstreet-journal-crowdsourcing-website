	SETI researchers ran into the obsolescence problem before turning to distributed computing. They started out building specialized supercomputers to handle the data from the radio telescopes. Because of the rapid advance of technology, though, a SETI-specific supercomputer has a short life span. ''After five years, your machine is kind of a dinosaur,'' Dr. Werthimer explained, ''and it's time to build something new.''
	Distributed computing has been around for several decades, but it has been greatly aided by two developments: the increasing speed of personal computers and the advent of the Internet, which provides an easy and almost instantaneous means of exchanging data between machines.
	''The speed of the common PC has increased to such a dramatic rate,'' Dr. Anderson said, ''that the high-end PC today is as fast as one of these Cray supercomputers was about 10 years ago.''
	The real rise of distributed computing can be traced to 1994, when Dr. Donald Becker and Dr. Thomas Sterling, working for the Center of Excellence in Space Data and Information Sciences at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, created a cluster computer from 16 processors networked together and dubbed it Beowulf.
