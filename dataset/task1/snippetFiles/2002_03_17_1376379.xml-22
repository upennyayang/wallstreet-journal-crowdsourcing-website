	The house chiller provides the base load cooling for the building, about 700 tons of it (a ton of cooling is the equivalent of 12,000 B.T.U.'s). The tanks of ice are designed to handle an additional 350 tons of cooling, without consuming any more electricity than is needed to run a few circulation pumps. To make room for the ice tanks, the Dursts removed two conventional cooling machines in the building's mechanical room and built a mezzanine level in the room to accommodate the insulated tanks that are connected with a web of piping. The Dursts are counting on the system to do the job, or the lawyers and others tenants in the building may be in for an uncomfortable summer. ''The house chiller is due to start operating on April 1 and the ice chiller on April 15,'' Jody Durst said. They are planning to install a co-generation plant at the 1.6 million square foot, 50-story office building they are planning for the middle of the block on 42nd Street between the Avenue of the Americas and Broadway, which they are calling One Bryant Park.
