	When he added that he planned to work closely with Gov. George E. Pataki on some issues, there was a smattering of boos. ''Now, now,'' Mr. Spitzer said, smiling, ''he's my client.''
	The complicated dynamics in that auditorium foreshadowed what has since turned out to be a prickly but productive interplay on environmental issues between the state's Republican chief executive and its Democratic top lawyer.
	In his first nine months in office, according to a variety of environmental groups, Mr. Spitzer has lived up to environmental campaign pledges that he outlined in commercials showing him walking the shores of the Hudson River deploring its stain of pollution from General Electric factories.
	But in so doing, he has invaded territory that for five years has largely been the domain of Mr. Pataki, who, despite a few detractors in the environmental movement, has built an impressive reputation as a conservationist.
	The turf battle surfaced most recently last Wednesday, when Mr. Pataki released details of an ambitious plan to cut power plant pollution. Simultaneously, Mr. Spitzer disclosed that he was making headway in an investigation of possible violations of pollution rules at the state's coal-fired plants.
