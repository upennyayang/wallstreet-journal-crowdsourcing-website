	Typical Internet users have no assurance that medical advice dispensed on the Web has been properly tested for effectiveness or safety, and most people lack the expertise to assess the validity of what they find.
	Unlike peer-reviewed reports in medical journals, information on the Web is not screened by independent experts who can determine whether the conclusions and recommendations are warranted by the available evidence. There are no quality standards for statements posted on the Web, and anyone with some computer savvy -- from ordinary patients and purveyors of products to top medical experts and government agencies -- can set up a Web site and promulgate ''facts'' for you and me to find.
	As the editors of The Journal of the American Medical Association put it: ''When it comes to medical information, the Internet too often resembles a cocktail conversation rather than a tool for effective health care communication and decision making. The problem is not too little information but too much, vast chunks of it incomplete, misleading, or inaccurate.''
	Some physicians are concerned with the tantalizing reports on the Internet of unproven ''nontoxic'' remedies for serious health problems, which may prompt patients to abandon established treatments.
