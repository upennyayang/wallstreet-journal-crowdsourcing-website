	The problems here involved not only the new touch-screen machines but also optical scanners, which ''read'' marks on paper ballots and which some counties had used in previous elections as well. In Union County, an optical scan system registered all votes as Republican. In Duval County, the ballots jammed in the machines. In Orange County, the machines shredded the ballots. But the biggest problems were in Miami-Dade County. The Miami Herald reported panic among some poll workers, who did not know how to operate the machines and overwhelmed election officials with phone calls. The newspaper reported that officials ''in some cases scrawled desperate messages on bits of paper. One note read: 'Precinct 547. Clerk is out of control.' '' The scope of the problems became evident when the returns came in. One Miami-Dade precinct, Liberty City, had 1,630 registered voters but only 89 recorded votes. In an election with an average turnout of more than 30 percent, about 60 Miami-Dade precincts showed a turnout of less than 10 percent. A few returns suggested that no one had voted. Such results told election officials that the machines had not been closed down properly, sending them to ''reharvest'' the votes from the machines.
