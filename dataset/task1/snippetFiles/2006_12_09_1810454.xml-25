	The eldest of six children, he was a standout student, applying himself with particular zeal to learning English. The method of study was arduous, with students required to write the same English sentences 10 times as a way of memorizing them. IN 1962, he won an English competition sponsored by the Red Cross and got a chance to visit the United States. The high point of that trip was a meeting at the White House with President John F. Kennedy, which he said first inspired him to become a diplomat. He married another high achiever, his school's student council president, Yoo Soon-taek, in 1971, a year after he had passed his diplomat's exam. The couple have two daughters, Seon-yong, 34, who works in Seoul for the Korea Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes Korean culture, and Hyun-hee, 30, a field officer for Unicef in Nairobi, Kenya. They also have a son, Woo-hyun, 32, who is studying for an M.B.A. at the University of California, Los Angeles. Mr. Ban is admittedly all work, no play. ''When you ask about hobbies, that's a question I have difficulty answering,'' he said.
