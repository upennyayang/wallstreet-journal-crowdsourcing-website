	Congress returns to an ambitious domestic agenda this week, but Iraq is likely to overshadow the discussion as lawmakers, including some influential Republicans, demand a clear accounting from President Bush of how he plans to bring stability to the region. Prescription drugs and energy will be the two marquee domestic issues. The House and Senate are under pressure from the president to conclude negotiations on a Medicare drug benefit -- negotiations so delicate that some lawmakers fear they might fall apart. The chambers will also try to come to terms on an energy bill, a measure that has gained urgency in light of the summer's blackout. At the same time, lawmakers will be scrambling to wrap up work on 13 spending bills needed to put the new budget in place by Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, though Republican leaders concede they are unlikely to meet that deadline. The partisan fighting will be fierce. Republicans vow to hold the line on spending, while Democrats plan a drumbeat of attacks on cuts in education and health care. The debates will be complicated by the ballooning federal deficit, as well as the situation in Iraq.
