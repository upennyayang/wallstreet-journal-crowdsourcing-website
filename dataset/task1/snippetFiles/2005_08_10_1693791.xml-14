	But John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, questioned whether pouring money into some of the alternatives, especially the new vehicles derived from shuttle parts, could speed their arrival. ''If we were to retire the shuttle, it wouldn't get us new systems significantly faster,'' Dr. Logsdon said. ''It would mean we'd end up paying Russia to haul people and cargo back and forth to the station.'' He added that NASA managers during the Discovery's mission proved themselves cool even under great stress and uncertainty. ''That gives significant confidence that NASA will be able to manage the shuttle for the rest of its lifetime,'' Dr. Logsdon said. ''The humans came out better than the machine.'' On paper, the goals of this mission were straightforward: resupplying the space station and testing an external tank that had been modified so as not to shed the kind of launching debris that doomed the Columbia. But the crew -- Colonel Collins and Col. James M. Kelly, Stephen K. Robinson, Wendy B. Lawrence, Charles J. Camarda, Andrew S.W. Thomas and Soichi Noguchi of Japan -- ended up having a busy two weeks.
