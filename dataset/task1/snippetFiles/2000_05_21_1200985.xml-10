	Bird-watching, in other words, may be what you do at the end of nature. According to Frank Gill, director of science for the National Audubon Society, one out of every six species in North America is in trouble, declining 2 to 10 percent a year; over 20 or 30 years, that means whole species would be cut in half -- or worse.
	On the wall of my study, near a multiplying collection of bird books, hangs a reproduction of Audubon's portrait of two passenger pigeons. Although these birds roosted communally and flew in flocks so vast that they darkened the sky for hours while passing overhead, Audubon has given them individual life, a male and female, touching bills. I find these birds, peach and blue and gray, not merely beautiful but haunting, a sort of avian memento mori. One hundred years ago, on March 24, 1900 (and it adds a weirdly modern element that we know the exact date), the last wild passenger pigeon ever recorded was shot out of the sky in Pike County, Ohio. Fourteen years later, the last surviving member of the species, a bird named Martha, died at the Cincinnati Zoo.
