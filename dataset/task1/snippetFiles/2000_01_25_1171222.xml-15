	Dr. Edward Witten, a physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study, described the theoretical innovations at the heart of the electroweak theory as ''the main lessons of elementary particle physics in the last half century.''
	Beyond his many research papers, Dr. Weinberg has also made a mark with writings that include scientific monographs like ''Gravitation and Cosmology'' and ''The Quantum Theory of Fields,'' popular books like ''Dreams of a Final Theory'' and ''The First Three Minutes: A Modern View of the Origin of the Universe'' and articles and essays on culture and science in publications like The New York Review of Books, Scientific American and George magazine.
	Steven Weinberg was born on May 3, 1933, and grew up so close to Yankee Stadium that ''the lights kept you up at night,'' he said. His mother and his paternal grandfather immigrated from Europe. Much of his mother's family in Germany died in the Holocaust. His father made a living as a court stenographer.
	As a boy, he absorbed classical music on the radio and learned chemistry from a hand-me-down set, ChemCraft #5. Despite his proximity to the ballpark, he was not a sports fan.
