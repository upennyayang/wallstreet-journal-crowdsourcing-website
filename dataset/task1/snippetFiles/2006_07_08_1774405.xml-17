	On the other hand, from half to two-thirds of third-year undergraduates reported that their professors never provided opportunities to discuss the meaning and purpose of life or spiritual and religious matters.
	Had Professor Sommerville mined findings like those, he might have nuanced his impressions but not, one suspects, by much. Clearly, there is a gap between what undergraduate students are looking for and what professors, regardless of their religious convictions, feel they can or should try to provide.
	Many readers may also find Professor Sommerville tantalizingly elusive about exactly how he envisions that religious viewpoints might be introduced into university discourse.
	Obviously, he thinks that serious theological thought should be a presence on university campuses, not limited to divinity schools or restricted to religious studies departments that emphasize detached description of religions but not working out problems from within them.
	He is appalled, he writes, that '' 'sin,' 'trinity,' 'incarnation' and 'creation' are words that would be greeted with incomprehension in the academy today.''
	Yet, along with other legacies of Christian thought, he judges them essential to much of what the university holds dear, including its often critical stance toward its own culture.
