	Economists are increasingly interested in the role of such networks in economic life. They want to understand ''the way that an individual's social connections somehow translate into an economically valuable tool,'' Rajeev Dehejia, a Columbia University economist currently visiting at Harvard, said in an interview.
	In particular, he and other economists have recently begun to examine how, in addition to any spiritual or otherworldly benefits, religious affiliation may serve as a kind of insurance.
	With two co-authors, Thomas DeLeire of Michigan State and the Congressional Budget Office, and Erzo F.P. Luttmer of Harvard, Professor Dehejia takes up the question in a new working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research. (The paper, titled ''Insuring Consumption and Happiness Through Religious Organizations,'' is available at columbia.edu/rd247/papers/Dehejia--DeLeire--Luttmer.pdf.
	The paper uses two sets of data, measuring two different kinds of well-being, to address the question. In the first, the economists use the government's authoritative Consumer Expenditure Survey to see how a household's spending changes when income changes. Since the survey records whether respondents contribute to religious groups, the researchers use that as their marker of religious participation.
