	The working draft of three years ago contained most human genes and was useful for researchers seeking a specific gene. But up to a year ago biologists said they often had to do considerable extra sequencing work on the DNA regions they were interested in.
	The completed genome announced today is far more accurate. It can be used out of the box, so to speak, without extra resequencing. The genes and other important elements of the genome are now almost all in their correct position, a vital requirement for researchers seeking to locate a gene that contributes to disease.
	Scientists praised the Human Genome Project for its further three years of hard work and for producing a resource of enormous value to research. But several qualified their admiration by noting that even if the project is complete, the human genome is not. The parts of the genome still missing are of minor importance, but many biologists would like to see them sequenced before declaring the genome finished.
	The human genome is packaged in 23 pairs of chromosomes, each a giant molecule of DNA.
	Within the rest of the DNA, known as euchromatic DNA, some regions are very hard to sequence for technical reasons.
