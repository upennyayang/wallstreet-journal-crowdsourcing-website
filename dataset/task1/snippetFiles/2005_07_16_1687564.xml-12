	The agency was joined in the case by the attorneys general of 11 states that oppose carbon dioxide regulation and a coalition of trade groups, including the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.
	Because of the fractured decision, the case did not turn out to be quite the showdown over global warming that was expected. Neither did it settle the question about how much authority the federal agency has to take action on emissions that some believe contribute to the heating of the earth, but that others do not think has any direct relation to climate change on such a large scale.
	The emissions case dates to 1999, when several states and environmental groups formally petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons in new motor vehicles to control greenhouse gas emissions.
	In 2003, the federal agency rejected the petition, arguing that it lacked the statutory authority to act.
	Several states, led by Massachusetts, argued in federal court that the agency's decision had been based on the conclusion that the connection between greenhouses gas emissions and global warming ''cannot be unequivocally established,'' which was the finding of a report by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences.
