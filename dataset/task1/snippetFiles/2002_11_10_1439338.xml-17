	The company, which has regional offices in Ridgefield Park, N.J., said in a statement that it would consider all options. ''Agfa has had many offers on the site, ranging from developers to Tesla-related societies,'' said the statement by Robert Hoffmann, director of general services and facilities for the Agfa Corporation in Ridgefield Park. But, he added, the property is not now under contract or listed with any broker.
	Mr. Hoffmann said that the site was structurally sound and that company officials were aware of its historic significance.
	The company declined to support listing it on state and national registers of historic places. Once the property is sold or donated, applying for that designation would be up to the new owner, Mr. Hoffmann said.
	As long ago as 1967, the Town of Brookhaven named the laboratory property a historic site. But no formal application has been made for the state designation, a precursor to the federal designation.
	James P. Warren, a historic preservation program analyst for the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, said owner consent was usually required for a listing on the state register and always required for the national register.
