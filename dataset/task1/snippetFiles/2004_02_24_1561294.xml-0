	Bill Clinton gave new meaning to the phrase ''I feel your pain.'' But the results of a recent study may now give the words some scientific weight.
	Seeing a loved one endure a slight electrical shock, researchers have found, activates a brain region that processes pain, pointing to a possible neurological basis for empathy.
	The same area lighted up on brain scans when the subjects themselves were zapped. As people watched their companions suffer, their brains appeared to recreate the unpleasant experience, in effect allowing them to feel their partners' pain.
	Empathy has long been considered part of the social glue that holds together society, the force that drives a mother and child to connect or that prompts one person to hold the elevator door for another.
	But whether it is a raw human emotion as basic as anger or a mental skill as complex as language has baffled scientists. The question has also led to a debate over whether other animals are capable of empathy and, if so, how they express it.
	In a study published in the Feb. 20 issue of Science, British researchers used imaging techniques to peer into the brains of people who were experiencing empathy.
