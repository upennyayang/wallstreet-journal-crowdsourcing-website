	Dr. Dvali's theory was welcomed by the astronomers as a sign that string theory was beginning to come down from its ivory tower of abstraction and make useful, testable predictions about the real world. (In another string contribution, Dr. Steinhardt introduced a new theory of the early universe, in which the Big Bang is set off by a pair of branes clashing together like cymbals.)
	Afterward Dr. Riess and Dr. Perlmutter pressed Dr. Dvali on what they would see when they looked out past the crossover point where gravity began falling out of the world; would the transition between a decelerating universe and an accelerating one happen more abruptly than in the case of the cosmological constant? Dr. Dvali said he hadn't done any calculations, but he said it was his ''na√Øve guess'' that the crossover would happen more smoothly than in a lambda world.
	''I'd love to see this guy do some Hubble diagrams,'' Dr. Riess said.
	Even if Dr. Dvali could be coaxed into providing a prediction, however, success in identifying the dark energy was not guaranteed to the astronomers.
	Dr. Turner refused to be swayed from his ''irrational exuberance.''
