	In ''Picture Perfect,'' Mr. Mellor stresses that all of his designs will work on home lawns, introducing perhaps a new competition to the already cutthroat suburban Olympics. Many lawn mower manufacturers, including Toro and Simplicity (Mr. Mellor endorses the latter), sell roller attachments for people who want their yards to resemble ball fields.
	Yet his own lawn, in Norfolk, Mass., is very much ''a work in progress,'' Mr. Mellor said. His daughters, ages 7 and 11, are fond of dandelions, and have persuaded him to let them be. The girls compete to create designs for the grass and to ride the mower with him. ''They have a friendly rivalry,'' he said. The younger one, Victoria, wants him to make a Scooby-Doo design, preferably at Fenway. Perhaps someday, he said.
	Mr. Mellor will not speak of the other, more professional rivalries that surround his field at Fenway, nor of the Curse of the Bambino, the 81 years without a championship. He prefers not to focus on the negative. For his part, he did not believe his turf was cursed. ''You hear fans talk about it,'' he said, ''but I've never heard a player talk about it.''
