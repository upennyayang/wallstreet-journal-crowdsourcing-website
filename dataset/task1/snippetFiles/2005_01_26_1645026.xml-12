	Freeman had a high tolerance for failure. He was taking difficult cases and, as often as not, making it possible for them to go home and put together some semblance of a normal life. In time, he developed a new technique, transorbital lobotomy, that eliminated many of the side effects of prefrontal lobotomy by entering the brain through the eye socket rather than the cranium. The new procedure was quick. In 1952, Freeman once performed 25 transorbital lobotomies in a single day. This was the sort of stunt that caused Freeman's professional colleagues to eye him suspiciously. ''I thought I was seeing a circus act,'' a student nurse said, recalling a performance in which Freeman used both hands at once to cut nerve fibers on both sides of a patient's brain simultaneously. Psychoanalysts regarded Freeman with contempt, and many doctors recoiled at tdestroying healthy brain tissue. Freeman, a flamboyant figure who affected a cane, a broad-brimmed hat and a long goatee, invited controversy by his slapdash approach to research and his love of the spotlight.
	His enemies triumphed. By the mid-1950's, psychoanalysis and the appearance of new drugs like Thorazine spelled the end of the lobotomy in the United States.
