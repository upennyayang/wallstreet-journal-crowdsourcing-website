	Gorillas had been the only great apes not known as tool users in the wild, but now they've joined the club. Scientists from the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany have observed two gorillas in the Congo Republic using tree branches and other objects to help with tasks.
	One of the animals used a dead tree branch to determine the depth of a pool of water she wanted to wade through. The other used the broken-off trunk of a shrub as a support as she was digging herbs, and then used it again as a makeshift bridge to cross a muddy patch of ground. The observations were reported in the open-access journal PLoS Biology (www.plos.org).
	A Bump for Bugs That Walk on Water
	Your average water-walking insect makes a mountain out of a meniscus. For a water strider or other bug on the surface of a pond, the spot where water meets the shore, a stick or another object presents an obstacle -- an upward-curving meniscus created by surface tension -- that is like a mini-Mount Everest.
	Some bugs can, however, scale a meniscus.
