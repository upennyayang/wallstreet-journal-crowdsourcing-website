	Still, Sister Deignan, aware of the divisive nature of the discussion, takes pains to point out that her involvement with the conference came as a representative of Iona, not of her order.
	Sister Deignan was born to Irish immigrants on the Upper West Side ''before the Yuppies,'' she says, ''when Zabar's was just a little pickle store.'' Smitten by the ''mysterious allure'' of the life of a nun, she embarked on a systematic study of different religious orders, going to something akin to a job fair for prospective nuns and spreading the literature she collected over her bed. She chose the Congregation of Notre Dame because she thought it was the most progressive and musically oriented order, and she spent two years studying and praying before attending Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Conn., and starting a teaching career.
	THEN she met Mrs. Terry, whose personal story and passionate advocacy for her children led Sister Deignan to reflect on the relationship between science and faith.
	Mrs. Terry began the conference with a speech describing her children's disease and how it made her an ardent supporter of genetic research. Later, at lunch, she and Sister Deignan spoke about Sister Deignan's musical career -- she sets scripture to song.
