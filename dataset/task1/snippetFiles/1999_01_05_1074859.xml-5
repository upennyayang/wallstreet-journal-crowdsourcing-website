	There was no immediate reaction from the Cuban Government. Reforms in American policy toward Cuba were under review three years ago, but were halted when Cuba shot down Cuban-American pilots for an anti-Castro group. The proposals moved forward after Pope John Paul II visited Cuba a year ago. ''The Pope's visit created a wedge'' through which political light and air can stream into Cuba, a senior Administration official said. Another factor was the death last year of Jorge Mas Canosa, the leader of the Cuban American National Foundation and the most vocal and influential anti-Castro Cuban-American political figure in the United States. The nature and timing of the announcement also arose in part from a report just completed by the Council on Foreign Relations, published under the signature of two former senior State Department officials. The report proposed essentially similar steps, and some bolder ones, such as granting some American businesses licenses to operate in Cuba and promoting Cuban-American military ties. The council's report said it was intended to ''break the current logjam'' in American policy toward Cuba. Under the steps recommended by Ms. Albright, the American embargo against Cuba, imposed 37 years ago, would remain in effect.
