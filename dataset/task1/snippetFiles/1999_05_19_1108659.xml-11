I do not want to disrespect my job, I'm working and making money without hurting anybody. But if I go back to Bangladesh to get married, the first question her parents want to ask is what I do. A bartender is considered in Islamic law a bad job.'' Although Mr. Fajardo now has a better job working at a shoe store, he is restless. He wants to work on Wall Street, just like some of the people he sees at the store. They see him, too, he said. ''Now I can talk with the clients,'' he said. ''It's a different class of people. Now we can speak about what happens on Wall Street. Without an education, you don't know what they're talking about.'' In school, he has started to find his voice. ''You realize you're not the same person you were before,'' he said. ''You have something to talk about. You can change things.'' Learn a language and change the world.
