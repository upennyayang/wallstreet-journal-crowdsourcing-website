	Dr. Huntington F. Willard, an expert on the X chromosome at Duke, said that the human genome sequence now available was ''a momentous achievement'' but that ''we shouldn't declare the job 'complete' until it is.'' He said it was ''critical that the complete human genome sequence be, well, complete, in the fullness of time.''
	Dr. Evan Eichler, a computational biologist at Case Western Reserve University who studies certain duplicated regions of the genome, said, ''For the vast majority of users, this is in fact an operational completion.'' But, like Dr. Willard, he said work on the genome should continue until ''every base is completely in place.'' The task might take 10 to 20 years, he said, and he expressed concern that the effort might not be sustained.
	A prime beneficiary of the essentially completed genome is DeCode Genetics of Reykjavik, Iceland, which is screening the entire Icelandic population for disease-causing variant genes. Dr. Kari Stefansson, the president of the company, said the single base variants known as SNP's were now accurately assigned on the genome sequence 99 percent of the time, compared with 93 percent accuracy previously.
