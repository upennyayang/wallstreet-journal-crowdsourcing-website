	Mr. Block, for example, said he has evidence not only that baseball is older than rounders, but also that baseball originated in England. He cited seven references to baseball in 18th-century English documents, and he said he had found a book written in German in 1796 that refers to ''English baseball.''
	''They give rules of the game and it starts with a pitcher serving the ball to a batter,'' Mr. Block said. ''The batter has three tries to put the ball in play. The batter runs around something like bases. It defies reason that there isn't some linkage between baseball and the game they are describing.''
	The small gaggle of professional baseball historians relish each of these tidbits as they are unearthed, but some are past the point of being surprised. Inside the Hall of Fame, Mr. Spencer, the curator, pointed to a reproduction hanging on a wall. It is a drawing from Spain in 1251 of people playing a game.
	''There's a bat and there's a ball,'' Mr. Spencer said, looking at the drawing. ''It looks like two guys playing baseball to me.''
	Not far away is another faint reproduction of an Egyptian wall inscription: pharaohs perhaps engaged in another baseball game.
