	''I want to emphasize,'' he said in an interview, ''that these pictures are not computer simulations. They are like photographs: true images of real objects.''
	The orbitals of the electrons arrayed in shells around different atoms are shaped differently, and their shapes are slightly altered when they interact with other atoms to become bonds. Detecting the subtle changes in shape of bonds connecting copper and oxygen atoms, one of the objects of the Arizona team's investigation, required extremely sensitive measurement.
	''It was as difficult as weighing the captain of a ship by weighing a ship with the captain on it and then subtracting the weight of the ship,'' Dr. Spence said.
	The complex technique developed at Arizona State involves the scattering of X-rays and electrons from atoms arrayed in crystal lattices. X-rays are scattered mainly by the nuclei of atoms, while electron beams are scattered mostly by the electronic bonds holding the crystal together.
	The beams do not directly create images of nuclei or bonds. But as impinging waves of X-rays or electrons recoil from their atomic targets, they interfere with one another and create complex patterns of spots.
