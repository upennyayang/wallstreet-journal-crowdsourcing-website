	The focus of his thinking was the anatomy of the NMDA receptor. The intricate biological device is shaped like a cylinder or doughnut embedded in the outer wall of certain brain cells. Usually its central channel is firmly closed. But when the nerve cell receives signals from two other nerve cells at the same time, the NMDA channel springs open, allowing a current to flow into the cell. This current generates a long-lasting change within the cell, making it much more responsive the next time that either of the two other nerve cells is active alone.
	This property of the NMDA receptor -- opening when two signals arrive simultaneously -- has long been suspected to be the basic mechanism of memory, because it is a way for the brain to make an association between two events. The exact degree of simultaneity turns out to be very important. In young mice, two signals can arrive as much as one-tenth of a second apart for their coincidence to change the nerve cell. In older animals, the NMDA receptor allows a much narrower window of time for an association to register.
	Another known fact about the receptor was that its composition changed with the age of the animal.
