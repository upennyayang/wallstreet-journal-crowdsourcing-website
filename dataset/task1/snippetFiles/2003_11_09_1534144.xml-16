	TWENTY years after its birth, NASA at last invited women to apply to its astronaut program as ''mission specialists,'' and at least 1,500 did. From that pool the agency selected a pioneer class of six, each a woman of outstanding accomplishment: a heart surgeon, an electrical engineer, an astrophysicist, a geologist. All, intriguingly, were oldest daughters, with highly supportive parents. All were quite accustomed to working with men, having come from fields where they often were the only woman on the block. Only one, Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, considered herself a feminist. Yet even as women quickly proved themselves capable of spacewalks, space repairs, space press conferences, not until July 1999 -- the 30th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's giant leap for ''mankind'' -- would a woman, Eileen Collins, at last serve as commander of a shuttle flight. The percentage of women in the astronaut corps has doubled since 1978, but the men still far outnumber them.
	Other milestones await us -- not as men or women, but as human beings, restless wanderers who love a good dare. This year the flirtatiously close approach of Mars reminded us that we have work to do.
