	Coughing, for example, is not a disease in itself but is the body's attempt to rid itself of bacteria in the lungs. Diarrhea and vomiting, though unpleasant, also serve as defenses, evolving as ways to evade danger, and thus to preserve fitness. And the ability to feel pain is essential for an organism's survival. ''People who are born without any capacity to feel pain are usually dead by early adulthood,'' Dr. Nesse said.
	Similarly, emotions like anxiety, fear and depression can be viewed as defensive strategies. Such defenses make sense, Dr. Nesse noted, because they have a low cost, especially when compared with their potential for protection. Vomiting, for instance, involves only the loss of few hundred calories, but might save an animal's life if the substance ingested is poisonous. In the same way, being frightened and anxious when no threat exists is a small price to pay for the readiness to fight or flee when true danger looms. Yet these tactics also sometimes go awry, and illness results: chronic pain syndromes or panic attacks, for example.
	Dr. Nesse believes the need to gain a deeper understanding of what purpose depression might serve is especially pressing at a time when the illness is so prevalent.
