	Among those entering the field is Dr. J. Craig Venter, the maverick scientist whose biotech company, Celera Genomics, defied skeptics and determined the human genetic sequence in a scant three years. Dr. Venter, who now runs nonprofit research institutes in Rockville, Md., is trying to determine the genomes of all of the microbes in the Sargasso Sea, an area of the Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda known for its floating seaweed.
	That area of the ocean is considered relatively devoid of life. Nevertheless, Dr. Venter said, ''Just from the Sargasso Sea alone, we've discovered more new genes than in the human genome.''
	The project is being done by Dr. Venter's Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives, which seeks to harness microbes to make clean-burning hydrogen fuel and reduce global warning. Another of his research centers, the Institute for Genomic Research, is trying to sequence the genomes of all the organisms in the human intestinal tract. The information could lead to new ways to diagnose and treat diseases.
	Until now, scientists have started with a known species, be it humans or anthrax bacteria, and sequenced the genome to learn more about it. But metagenomics works in reverse.
