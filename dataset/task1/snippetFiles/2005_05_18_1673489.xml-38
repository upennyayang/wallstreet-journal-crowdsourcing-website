	Gardenhire said last week that he had not been able to learn what steroid Twins reliever Juan Rincon had tested positive for. Rincon, who has completed his 10-day suspension, has said he never knowingly took a banned substance.
	''I think probably what's happening more than anything with pitchers or whatever, it's the supplements,'' Gardenhire said. ''I think there needs to be a little more education on what is and what isn't legal. Maybe they have, but it has not worked. If a lot of guys are getting busted for steroids right now, and they don't know what they're doing, we're in trouble.''
	The case of Rincon, a native of Venezuela, has highlighted a contentious issue regarding drug suspensions.
	An analysis published earlier this month by The Associated Press showed that about half of the suspended baseball players this season were from Latin America. This has raised a debate about whether steroid use in Spanish-speaking countries is purposeful and the result of more easily obtainable steroids and unsavory trainers -- who facilitate the desperation of young players trying to make it to the big leagues -- or inadvertently the result of a language barrier.
