	The long-term goal of such experiments is to help paralyzed people by developing machines that operate on the basis of human thoughts alone, said Dr. Miguel A. L. Nicolelis, a neuroscientist at Duke University, who led the team that carried out the new research, which is described in today's issue of the journal Nature.
	Making a robot move in real time based on the activity of many brain cells in primates is ''an important step'' in developing neural prostheses, said Dr. Richard A. Andersen, a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena who does similar research. In most previous experiments, Dr. Andersen said, brain signals were fed into machines some time after the signals were obtained from animals.
	But Dr. Andrew Schwartz, a senior fellow at the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego, who also works on the problem, cautioned, ''We're not there yet.''
	Dr. Schwartz said it would take many years to engineer safe versions of personal robotic devices.
	Still, researchers said that the research reported today was a major step forward.
	The race to develop machines that can read the human mind began more than 30 years ago when scientists first put single electrodes into the brains of monkeys.
