	The gray skiffs come and go in the dim November light, each crew accelerating their vessel's bow through the surf as they head offshore to pull nets. Just up the beach, behind a wall draped with drying mesh, a crew handles its catch: 12 freshly landed osetra and sevruga sturgeon, each two to five feet long. A fisherman works the knife, unzipping the fish with swift sweeps of a blade. These fishermen are poachers, chasing one of the world's most threatened and coveted fish, although judging by the indifferent police officers stationed a few hundred yards away, even highly organized poaching here carries few risks. No resource, not even the oil that has shaped this region's politics and economies, is more richly associated with the Caspian basin than the sturgeon, a group of primeval fish bound to human history along the shores of the world's largest landlocked body of water. Once fare for pashas and czars, its briny eggs are among the most valuable wildlife commodities on earth. Now, scientists say, the Caspian's sturgeon risk entering a final downward spiral. The fish have faced compounding problems for decades. Dams have walled off their spawning grounds.
