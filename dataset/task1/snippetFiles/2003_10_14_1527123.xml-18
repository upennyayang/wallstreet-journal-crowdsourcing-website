	In a small lab area filled with the country-night sounds of chirping crickets (the frog food), Dr. Ryan reaches into a moss-filled container and pulls out a tiny brown túngara, which hops once and then perches on his finger. ''She's kind of fat. Probably has a few eggs,'' he says. ''A male would have this big vocal sac to make his calls.''
	That call is the problem for a male túngara. A sliding whine followed by abrupt chucks, it sounds a bit like a little boy imitating a dive bomber. Female frogs hop to when they hear it. But hungry fringe-lipped bats also tune in; the call is their beacon for finding frogs to gobble.
	So a male túngara is caught between two evolutionary pressures. And as Darwin himself pointed out, sexual selection creates paradoxical traits in males of many species, like huge peacock tails -- so useless for flight, so good for impressing peahens.
	To a biologist who thinks traits serve fitness here and now, all this is just natural selection with an extra step.
	Dr. Ryan was giving a talk along those lines a dozen years ago and ad libbed.
