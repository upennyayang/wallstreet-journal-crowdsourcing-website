	Those authors with boldface connections can spice up the audio versions of their books. Adriana Trigiani, the author of popular novels about Italian-Americans, asked Mario Cantone, a comedian and regular on ''Sex and the City,'' to read the audio version of ''Rococo,'' produced by Random House Audio last year. Ms. Trigiani, who knew Mr. Cantone from their days on the comedy circuit together, said Mr. Cantone had partly inspired the lead character in ''Rococo,'' a New Jersey interior designer named Bartolomeo di Crespi.
	Mr. Cantone even joined Ms. Trigiani for a few readings on her book tour. But he said he would not want to record another audio book, unless it was the sequel to ''Rococo.'' ''It's a lot of work,'' he said, ''for that kind of money.''
	Indeed, those celebrities who perform on audio books see it mainly as a way to express their support for a friend or favorite author. Jello Biafra, the former lead singer of the Dead Kennedys, said he agreed to read the part of Osama bin Laden on Mr. Palast's ''Armed Madhouse'' because he wanted to help Mr. Palast get out his muckraking message about the Bush administration.
