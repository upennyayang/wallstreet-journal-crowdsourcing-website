	Over the years, the construction of these messages has become increasingly elaborate, involving props, locations, computer animation and music. ''I'm so nervous before I send them out,'' Mr. Gosfield says. ''Is everything spelled right? Is all the animation going to work with different browsers? Is this thing really stupid?''
	But they have also become more intimate, reflections of some very private concerns. Last fall, his wife was hit by a truck. She survived, but not before being dragged for a block. ''I turned her into a cowgirl who had been dragged under a horse, but survived in great fashion,'' Mr. Gosfield says. Set to ''Happy Trails,'' an animated Saint Camilla is told by the ''Great Cowboy in the Sky'' to ''Get yr cowgirl self out from under the truck and into the world and preach the gospel of hard ridin' and good times!''
	For all his irreverence, Mr. Gosfield still sounds a bit awestruck when he talks about his saints, the figures at the center of all his stylistic and technological experimentation. ''I kind of have crushes on them for that month,'' he admits. ''I'm a saint slut.''
