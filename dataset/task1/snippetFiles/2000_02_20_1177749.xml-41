	There the little bridegroom was at my fingertips. He was almost small enough to be Tom Dewey on top of a wedding cake. After we shook, he swam ashore and hopped up on the rocks. It was a highlight of the trip: in one day we swam with sea lions and penguins. ON our fourth day, we visited the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island, where a valiant attempt is being made to save the giant tortoise. These turtles can weigh up to 500 pounds and look like slow Volkswagens. For hundreds of years, passing ships loaded hundreds of tortoises into their holds where they provided a constant supply of fresh meat. Darwin's ship, the Beagle, was no different. But now the Darwin Station's hatchery and its pens provide a sanctuary for these endangered giants. Here we met Lonesome George. He is the sole survivor of a kind of tortoise found only on Pinta, one of the Galapagos's lesser islands. As such, he was brought to the Darwin Station on Santa Cruz Island for his own protection. There were once 14 subspecies of tortoises in the Galapagos, but only 10 1/2 remain today.
