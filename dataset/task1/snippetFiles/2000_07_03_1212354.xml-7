	Most significantly, the federal scientists said, the proposed change signals their confidence that the comeback of the wolf, although limited to less than 5 percent of its former range in this country, constitutes an important ecological success story, like those of the American alligator, peregrine falcon and bald eagle.
	They say the lower 48 states had only about 400 wolves in 1973, when the Endangered Species Act was passed, almost all of them in Minnesota or Michigan. Now more than 3,500 animals roam parts of eight states. Thousands more live in Alaska, Canada and parts of Europe.
	''The question of the next decade will not be how to save the wolf, but rather how best to manage the animal,'' according to a recent status report written by Dr. L. David Mech, a biologist for the United States Geological Survey and a wolf expert.
	From coast to coast, conservation and property rights groups, ranchers and wildlife watchers still heatedly debate the possible reintroduction of a predator that is a first cousin of man's best friend but also is an age-old antagonist.
	Last year, New Hampshire's Legislature approved a bill banning the reintroduction of wolves.
