	By comparing the human genome with that of chimpanzees, people's closest living relative, scientists have identified a partial list of the genes that make people human.
	They include genes for hearing and speech, genes that wire the developing brain, genes for detecting odors and genes that shape bone structure.
	The comparison, reported yesterday in Science, was undertaken by Dr. Michele Cargill and colleagues at Celera Diagnostics in Alameda, Calif., who decoded most of the genes in the chimp's genome, and Dr. Andrew G. Clark and colleagues at Cornell, who made the analysis.
	A more complete version of the chimp genome is being prepared by government-financed DNA sequencing centers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Washington University School of Medicine. The two centers made a draft of their sequence available yesterday on public DNA databases.
	Humans and chimps shared a joint ancestor as recently as five million years ago. Biologists have long supposed that if they could identify the genes that changed in the evolutionary lineage leading from the joint ancestor to people, they would understand the genetic basis of how people differ from chimps and, hence, the essence of what makes humans human.
