	But Mr. Stavans found that the more that he tried to become like everyone else, the more he felt different. He dropped out of college after two years to embark on a Hemingwayesque life as a writer in Spain, England and Israel. He eventually returned to Mexico City to complete his undergraduate studies in psychology, appeasing parents who wanted him to have a backup if writing did not succeed. Mr. Stavans was already writing under his father's stage name when he moved to New York in 1985. He enrolled at the Jewish Theological Seminary, where he met his wife, Alison Sparks Stavchansky, who is a speech pathologist. They have two young boys. He studied for his doctorate in Latin American literature at Columbia University. There he wondered why so little attention was paid to Latino writers in the United States. His approach to the question of Hispanic identity, however, has not won admiration from some Latino scholars. Mr. Stavans said he stresses similarities among Hispanic groups rather than differences. That contrasts with a more confrontational approach that emphasizes Latino ambivalence and even resistance to American culture and history. ''I don't think Latinos are a separate nation in the U.S.,'' he said.
