	How did life emerge amid this mayhem? Quite probably it was a stop-and-go affair, with life first forming during a lull in the bombardment, only to be annihilated by the next big impact. Then the process was repeated, over and over. As the bombardment began to abate and the impacts diminished in severity, so isolated colonies of primitive microbes sheltering deep underground managed to cling on. One of these colonies was destined to become life as we know it.
	What about the preceding life forms? Were they all completely destroyed? It's possible that pockets of microbes could have survived in obscure niches until the next genesis, opening up the tantalizing prospect of two or more different forms of life co-existing on the same planet. Although they would compete for resources, one type of life is not necessarily bound to eliminate the rest. After all, within the microbial realm of ''life as we know it,'' many different species make a living side by side.
	Thus, microbes from another genesis -- alien bugs, if you will -- could conceivably have survived on Earth until today. The chances are that we wouldn't have noticed.
