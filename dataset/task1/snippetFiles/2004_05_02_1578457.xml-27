	To model her favorite wide-brimmed bonnet, and to jump-start a Nassau parks conservancy, Ms. Banks is planning the First Spring Hat Luncheon at the Carltun in Eisenhower Park on May 18. ''We need to emulate the success of Central Park,'' Ms. Banks said, boasting that Nassau's Eisenhower Park is larger than the city green. ''The best way to do that would be to have a hat luncheon and get powerful, well-connected women to wear wonderful hats.'' The conservancy, Ms. Banks said, will help restore and maintain Gold Coast-era mansions like the Chelsea Center and Nassau Hall in the Muttontown Preserve and Hempstead Hall at the Sands Point Preserve. To help entice 300 women in millinery finery to the luncheon, Ms. Banks gathered some of those well-connected, hat-wearing women to a planning meeting recently at Cedarmere, the 230-acre William Cullen Bryant estate in Roslyn Harbor. Joanne Adams, former president of the Garden City Historical Society, wore a classic black and white polka dot hat. ''Women of a certain era always wore hats,'' said Ms. Adams, who held a hat contest in Garden City in conjunction with last year's Belmont Festival.
