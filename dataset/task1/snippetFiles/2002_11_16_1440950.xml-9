	Mr. Templ and a colleague, Tina Walzer, an art historian, were browsing the Internet on Wednesday evening when they discovered that ''Wayside Shrine'' was coming up for sale.
	The painting went from Dr. Rieger's collection directly into the hands of Friedrich Welz, a prominent Nazi-era gallery owner who Aryanized most of the Rieger collection, according to ''Our Vienna: Aryanization in Austria,'' a book Mr. Templ and Ms. Walzer published last year in Germany.
	''If there is now a legal possibility to seize Aryanized property, it would really change the situation in art restitution,'' Ms. Walzer said.
	Willi Korte, a lawyer acting for one of Dr. Rieger's heirs, said, ''This is the beginning of all kinds of trouble'' for museums, galleries and auction houses in Europe.
	''Rieger parted with his collection under duress,'' Mr. Korte added, ''and from a U.S. legal perspective, they are stolen pictures, and we treat them as stolen property.''
	Mr. Korte helped represent the heirs of Lea Bondi, a Jewish gallery owner in Vienna whose paintings were also Aryanized.
	The Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, issued a grand jury subpoena, effectively preventing the painting from leaving the country.
