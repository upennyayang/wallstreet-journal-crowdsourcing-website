	The moves would let Cuban citizens receive millions more dollars from American friends and family members, allow them to buy more American food and medicine, permit more direct flights between the two countries, renew direct mail service from the United States and let the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban national baseball team play ball in March, the officials said today.
	Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright formally recommended the steps to President Clinton today, and the White House is expected to announce them on Tuesday.
	A senior Administration official, speaking in Ms. Albright's seventh-floor State Department offices, said the measures ''are intended to strengthen support for the Cuban people,'' to allow them ''some elbow room'' and ''some modicum of independence.''
	Other officials said the moves are intended to increase educational, religious and humanitarian contacts with Cuba.
	There was no immediate reaction from the Cuban Government.
	Reforms in American policy toward Cuba were under review three years ago, but were halted when Cuba shot down Cuban-American pilots for an anti-Castro group. The proposals moved forward after Pope John Paul II visited Cuba a year ago. ''The Pope's visit created a wedge'' through which political light and air can stream into Cuba, a senior Administration official said.
