	The sea ice is thickest above North America, where Canadian islands and the fingers of northern Greenland act as a sieve in the current. As the floes stack up there, they create pressure ridges up to 40 feet high. By contrast, a branch of the warm-water Gulf Stream keeps Norway's north coast ice-free. That warm flow continues under the ice along most of the northern Siberian coast.
	If the trend continues, it is there, the Eurasian Arctic, that the first significant opening of ice-clogged water is expected. Russia, Scandinavia and Japan are laying plans. Government ministers and shipping executives met in Oslo last fall and declared that ''considerable profit potential'' existed for a proposed shipping lane linking Western Europe and Asia across the mellowing Arctic. The Northern Sea Route is a centuries-old dream comparable to that of the Northwest Passage of Canada, which is even more solidly frozen.
	Ships using the Arctic to move cargo from Hamburg, Germany, to Yokohama, Japan, would save about 4,800 miles compared with the usual route through the Suez Canal. Current traffic is limited to the Russian Navy and a handful of heavily subsidized nickel ore carriers escorted by nuclear-powered icebreakers.
