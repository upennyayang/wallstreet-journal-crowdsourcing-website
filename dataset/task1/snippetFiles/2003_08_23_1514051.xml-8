	The school opens as Buddhism is faltering in Hawaii, and while church leaders are adamant that they are trying to create good citizens, not converts, some say they are hoping the academy sows the seeds of self-preservation.
	About 8 percent of Hawaii's population, or an estimated 100,000 people, are Buddhists, according to state figures. And the more than 50 Buddhist centers in the state give it one of the highest concentrations of Buddhists in the nation, according to Harvard University's Pluralism Project.
	But at Honpa Hongwanji Hawaii Betsuin, one of the largest temples in the state, membership has dropped 40 percent since 1992 to 1,500 families, said Bishop Chikai Yosemori. The bishop attributed the decline to intermarriage, the cultural assimilation of Hawaii's younger ethnic Japanese, and the dying off of older generations.
	The Honpa Hongwanji mission, the state's largest, sponsors the high school, but not all of its students are Buddhists. More than half come from Christian, public or home schools. The rest come from the mission's Buddhist elementary school. Bishop Yosemori said he hoped the faith would hold onto the young Buddhists, and possibly inspire them to become ministers.
