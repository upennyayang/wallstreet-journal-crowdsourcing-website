	Single photons could be transformed into qubits by passing them through polarizing filters like those used by photographers and sunglass makers to control glare. With the polarizers, some photons could be made to vibrate up and down as they travel, others side to side and still others diagonally. Those movements, in turn, could be used to represent different cubits.
	Potentially, photons are not likely to be the fastest quantum computer technology, said Dr. Knill at Los Alamos.
	But both Dr. Knill and Raymond Laflamme, also a quantum computing researcher at Los Alamos and a co-author of the paper, said that limitation would be more than offset by the ease with which photon-based computers could communicate. Unlike quantum computers that calculate by measuring atomic spin, photon-based machines could exchange data using variations of fiber optics systems that now power the Internet.
	Practical photon-based quantum computers are a long way off, Dr. Laflamme said, and all of their potential uses are still unknown.
	Right now it appears that they will be better at factoring huge numbers and simulating quantum theory effects than current computers, he said. They also have the potential to offer higher levels of security.
