	The other suit, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, is against Dr. Novello herself, citing similar charges. Each suit refers to press conferences by the commissioner in which the accusations against Dr. Arbit were detailed, as well as newspaper articles that quoted her views on Dr. Arbit, none of them flattering. The suit also takes issue with her vow to fight the hearing committee's findings in an appeal, which is pending.
	''This case is about the fact that under state law the only thing that should ever come out in terms of a doctor being disciplined is an adverse finding,'' said Michael K. Eidman, Dr. Arbit's lawyer. ''The commissioner has no business giving press conferences or having press releases about unsubstantiated charges. All we want is his day in court.''
	A Health Department spokeswoman, Kristine Smith, declined to comment on the lawsuits last night other than to say: ''We were served with the lawsuit last week and we are preparing our answer.''
	Under the state health code, doctors who are investigated by the department are cloaked in anonymity until final charges against them are upheld by a state committee assigned to examine the case.
