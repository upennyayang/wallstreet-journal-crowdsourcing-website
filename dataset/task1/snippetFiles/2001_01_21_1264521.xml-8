	''We really are going someplace that nobody's been before,'' said Barbara Jacak, an experimental physicist working on one of the detectors that sweeps up the particle debris and painstakingly analyzes it with the help of powerful computers.
	RHIC's allure to young scientists is not only its power, but the chance to get in on a new era of research from the very start. Dr. Drees is an accelerator physicist -- one of those who helped design RHIC and make it work. Her husband, Axel Drees, is also a RHIC physicist and former CERN scientist. Dr. Drees convinced her husband to move to Long Island and work at RHIC three years ago while they were both at CERN.
	Getting the first particle collisions at RHIC last June, which paved the way for the real experiments to begin, was ''the most exciting moment,'' she said.
	But though most scientists were enthusiastic about the new research at RHIC, which is 10 times more powerful than the CERN machine, some discord remained from a claim made last February by CERN scientists that a new state of matter, an extremely hot and dense mixture called quark-gluon plasma, was created during their accelerator run.
