	Opponents do not dismiss these benefits out of hand. Instead, they point out that the benefits are uncertain and lie in the distant future. Promises of breakthroughs must be seen in light of a long history of exaggerated hopes that scientific researchers have held out in return for financial support. Missile defense opponents point to a series of failed tests. Stem cell research opponents point to the much hailed but ultimately disastrous implantation of fetal cells in the brains of Parkinson's patients.
	Far more serious, say opponents, is that pursuing these uncertain gains for the future means violating here and now certain common understandings that have served as firewalls against equal threats to humanity. In the case of missile defense, that would be the ABM treaty; concerning stem cell research, the established prohibitions against using and destroying embryonic human life for research purposes.
	But where opponents argue that an entire delicate framework of restraint is being rashly dismantled, proponents maintain that the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
	Appealing to past successes in science and technology, proponents dismiss objections as only the latest form of Luddism.
	Perhaps that choice must be faced eventually, respond the opponents, but only after all reasonable alternatives are exhausted.
