	''It's not easy to go see them,'' Dr. Truchil said. ''There's no mass transit, the Meadowlands aren't very accessible, it's not centrally located for people in the rest of the state.''
	Likewise, because the team plays up in one corner of the state, it does not figure prominently in the region's sporting consciousness. The team's recent success has managed to win some converts outside New Jersey. Carlos Seo, 15, spoke with disdain about some of his classmates at Xaverian High School in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, who have jumped on the Nets bandwagon.
	''At my school a lot of kids have become Net fans,'' he said, as he waited to play on the basketball courts in McLaughlin Park in Brooklyn this week. ''They're front-runners. They go for the front teams. Those same guys last year were Philly fans'' when the Sixers were in the finals.
	Other fans are unabashed latecomers. ''I'm thinking of buying a Kenyon Martin jersey,'' said Marvin Barksdale, 21, a health care consultant from Fort Greene, Brooklyn, who was also playing ball at McLaughlin Park. He was referring to the star forward for the Nets who also happens to be his new favorite player.
