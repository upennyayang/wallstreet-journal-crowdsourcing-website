	Peeking Inside the Cell
	There are plenty of sensing technologies for detecting changes caused by chemical or biological processes. Litmus paper, for instance, can be used to determine changes in acidity caused by a chemical reaction in a laboratory beaker.
	But what about measuring a reaction inside a cell? That's a tricky proposition, not the least because of the dimensions involved. Most techniques for measuring metabolic reactions in cells require disrupting the cell.
	Now, researchers in Germany have come up with a system of molecule-size sensors that can measure cellular reactions in vivo. For starters, they have used it to measure the uptake of the sugar maltose by yeast.
	The researchers focused on a class of bacterial proteins called periplasmic binding proteins, which have the unusual characteristic of closing up, like a Venus flytrap, when they bind to a particular chemical. The researchers, who described their work in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used a specific protein that binds to maltose, and through a bit of genetic engineering added fluorescent proteins at either end. Then they engineered yeast cells to produce the binding protein.
	When a modified yeast cell takes in maltose, the sugar binds with the protein, causing it to fold up.
