	Dr. Arbit agreed, under tremendous pressure from the department, to forfeit his license while he awaited a hearing on 20 allegations involving 11 patients. Staten Island University Hospital, where he was chief of neurosurgery, was fined $80,000 in relation to the charges. When the fine was imposed, the Health Department held a press conference detailing the allegations, saying that Dr. Arbit's care had endangered patients.
	But last month, a state committee cleared the doctor of almost every charge, and restored his license, which is highly unusual once a doctor has been forced to surrender it. Dr. Arbit had adamantly denied the charges from the beginning, and sharply criticized the health commissioner, Dr. Antonia C. Novello, accusing her of violating his rights by making her accusations public before his hearing.
	In one of his lawsuits, which was filed last week in the New York State Court of Claims, Dr. Arbit accuses the Health Department of slandering and libeling him by making statements about the care he provided -- charges that were ultimately dismissed -- and by violating a health statute that protects the privacy of doctors under investigation by the department.
