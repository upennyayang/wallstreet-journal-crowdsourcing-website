	Because they are secretive and so little is known about the wolverine, humans have filled in the gaps with myth. The wolverine has earned names like ''devil bear'' and was believed by some tribes to be a spirit animal that connected the living and the dead.
	Female wolverines give birth to three or four tiny helpless white kits each winter in a multichambered den they excavate in the snow in high mountain cirques. They are fiercely protective and work hard in harsh conditions to find enough food to sustain their offspring.
	The high country is where wolverines become controversial.
	Winter recreation -- including backcountry skiing, helicopter skiing and snowmobiling -- is a fast growing pastime in the Rockies, and people often invade the redoubts where wolverines make their dens.
	''We're seeing increases in winter recreation from people in areas so remote now that never had activity before,'' said Stephen Hoffman, executive director of the Predator Conservation Alliance, a conservation group in Bozeman, Mont. ''Because of the intrusion,'' Mr. Hoffman said, ''they may abandon their den and move their kits.''
	They are sensitive to intruders. In one case documented by Mr. Krebs wolverines abandoned their den because of a heli-skiing operation, in which skiers are dropped by helicopter on remote mountaintops.
