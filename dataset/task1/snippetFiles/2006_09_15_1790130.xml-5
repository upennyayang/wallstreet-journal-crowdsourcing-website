	While publishing his book and developing the Web site BaseballHQ.com, Shandler started a fantasy baseball league in 1998 called Tout Wars, and it consisted of experts from noted baseball publications like Baseball Prospectus, RotoWire and RotoWorld.
	Shandler has won three Tout Wars titles, including both the American League and National League crowns in 1998, the only time a member of the league has achieved the feat. But he has had some down years recently; he is currently in ninth place in the A.L. Tout Wars.
	''I think he's struggling to adapt to a world he helped create,'' said Sam Walker, author of the book ''Fantasyland,'' which chronicles the history of fantasy baseball. ''Everyone who plays in these expert leagues now is incredibly well rounded in the statistical theory and the concepts he created, so in a way a lot of people are using Popeye's spinach against him.''
	Walker said Shandler was ''revered in the Rotisserie world because he's made so many innovations.''
	''And not just innovations in how you play fantasy baseball, but also real innovations in looking at baseball statistics and new ways of valuing players.
