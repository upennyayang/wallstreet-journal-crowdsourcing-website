	Halliburton said in a statement on Tuesday that three of four bodies found near an attack on a fuel convoy in Iraq this month were its employees. A captive Halliburton employee, Thomas Hamill, has been shown in a video distributed by his captors. A major private security provider in Iraq with access to intelligence information said that Halliburton had ''been slowed down in terms of the number of routes and convoys they can run'' and said the firm was having a difficult time hiring truck drivers to work in Iraq. He estimated that the overall number of Halliburton convoys was down by 35 percent. Despite the delays, several government and private officials in Iraq remained optimistic about the long term. ''Yes, you have to be careful, take prudent measures to reduce your risk,'' said Tom Wheelock, director of infrastructure programs for the United States Agency for International Development, which oversees some $3 billion in rebuilding contracts. ''And with that context, with those kinds of guidelines, you can have success.'' Admiral David J. Nash is the director of the Coalition Provisional Authority's program management office, which is awarding $9 billion in new rebuilding contracts.
