	Space buffs have long dreamed of sending astronauts to Mars. But that dream, which once looked like the next destination after Moon landings, is still far from reality, stymied by hurdles as much economic and political as technological.
	By the early 1950's, the pioneering rocket scientist Wernher von Braun had already worked out a detailed, if fanciful, plan for sending a fleet of 10 colossal spaceships to Mars, powered by conventional chemical rockets.
	''We've had the engineering capability with chemical propulsion to undertake a mission to Mars for years, for decades,'' said Les Johnson, who heads the exploration transportation technologies portion of the advanced space transportation program at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
	''What it boils down to,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''is, Is it safe enough? Is it affordable?''
	Lifting one pound of material from the Earth's surface into orbit costs about $10,000. With each of von Braun's interplanetary behemoths weighing about 4,000 tons -- or about 10 times the weight of the International Space Station once it is completed -- the price tag of merely lugging the building materials into orbit would run more than $800 billion.
