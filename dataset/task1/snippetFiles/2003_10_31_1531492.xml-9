	In April, the Mailman school created a National Center for Disaster Preparedness and hired Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Health Fund and a prominent voice on bioterrorism and other issues, as its first director.
	Dr. Rosenfield lured Dr. Lipkin from the University of California at Irvine, making him director of the Greene laboratory, and Dr. Lipkin, in turn, brought much of his research team with him and recruited other people to the lab, which has about 30 researchers. Dr. Lipkin was the first to identify a 1999 outbreak of encephalitis as the first appearance of West Nile virus in North America, and he helped develop tests for West Nile.
	Dr. Lipkin said he was very reluctant to leave California, ''but I recognized that the resources here would allow me to do work I couldn't do anywhere else.''
	A $6 million gift from the family of Jerome L. Greene, a philanthropist who died in 1999, created the laboratory and endowed the director's chair. The lab has an area designated as biosafety Level 3, or B.S.L. 3, where researchers can work with dangerous contagions that were off limits to Columbia before.
