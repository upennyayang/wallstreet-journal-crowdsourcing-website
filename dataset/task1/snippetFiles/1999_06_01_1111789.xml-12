	Proponents of wolf recovery say that restoring wolves would help to re-establish natural ecological relationships long sundered in the Northeast. For instance, wolves prey on moose, which are too big for coyotes. Moose have flourished in northern New England, both because there are no predators and because logging has created ideal second-growth habitat for them.
	Wolves, which along with cougars were historically the region's top predators, might restore some natural equilibrium with moose, say the advocates, just as they might help control runaway deer and beaver populations. In addition, the carcasses of animals killed by wolves provide food for scavengers that are essential elements of a complete ecosystem. Moreover, wolves have acquired a certain cachet, as their new popularity in Yellowstone testifies, and proponents say they bring in tourist dollars.
	But opponents argue, as they did in the West, that wolves would prey on livestock. There have been some attacks in the West, and owners of the livestock have been compensated from a special fund set up by the Defenders of Wildlife. In Idaho and around Yellowstone, owners are allowed under Federal rules to shoot wolves they see attacking livestock, and some have been legally killed.
