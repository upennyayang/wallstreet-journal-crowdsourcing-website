	Michael W. Davis, executive vice president of Himss Analytics, a health care technology consulting firm, said that NexSched and a handful of competitors were ''just beginning to penetrate the market'' and that fewer than 1 percent of physicians offices had installed the technology so far.
	''The patients who use it, love it,'' Dr. Blye said. ''They can see what is available and do it any time.'' Although she does not offer same-day scheduling, her patients ''can often come right in, if they see that someone has canceled.''
	Dr. Blye said that electronic scheduling, together with electronic medical records -- a system made by GE Healthcare -- enabled her staff of two internists and two nurse practitioners to save on overhead by eliminating one clerical employee.
	Pediatricians have been ahead of most doctors in staying open late and on Saturday mornings.
	There can be drawbacks. If doctors leave large blocks of their schedules available for impromptu visits, it can become difficult for patients to book routine appointments in advance with some pediatricians, said Dr. Thomas Handler, a health care research director at the Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm. ''Open access can work wonderfully for urgent care, and horribly for routine annual visits,'' he said.
