	It was the weekend before opening day, and the thaws of spring had swelled the Charles River. When the grounds crew started to peel back the infield tarp, Mr. Mellor found a bass that had been washed up through the drain by the first-base dugout. In all, ''there were a dozen fish on the field,'' he said.
	For Mr. Mellor, the appearance of strange animal life on the field was nothing new. The life of a major league groundskeeper may not be glamorous, but it affords a window into a world not seen by people in other professions.
	In Milwaukee, for example, where he started his career, fans liked to throw bratwurst onto the field to express their opinion of the play. The meat drew the attention of skunks, which came to live under the bleachers, creeping out to feast whenever the hankering hit, sometimes during the games. These animals became the responsibility of the grounds crew, who had to shoo them out without being bitten or sprayed.
	On another occasion in Milwaukee, after Mr. Mellor opened a gate for a supply truck, a woman drove her car onto the field, chasing him around the infield until she finally hit him.
