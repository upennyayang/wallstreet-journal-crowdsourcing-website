	Now, in the current issue of the journal Nature, researchers report finding that at least one bird, a dazzling creature aptly named the superb fairy-wren, has evolved the ability to recognize the cuckoo chick for what it is. These tiny colorful birds, upon returning to a nest in which the cuckoo chick is waiting all alone (after pitching all the rightful chicks out the nest hole), simply abandon the invader, leaving it to its death. ''This has been a major enigma,'' said Dr. Stephen Rothstein, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara who was not involved with the study. ''This paper is a real advance. It's by far the strongest and clearest evidence that birds can discriminate against cuckoo nestlings.'' Dr. Naomi Langmore, an evolutionary ecologist at Australian National University and the lead author on the paper, said she and colleagues studied the birds in a small patch of bushland near Canberra, in an open forest of eucalyptus trees where the superb fairy-wrens -- iridescent blue males and brown females -- could easily be seen darting about on the forest floor, chittering to one another and chasing after insects.
