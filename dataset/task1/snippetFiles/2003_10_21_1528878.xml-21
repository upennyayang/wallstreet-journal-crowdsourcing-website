	It is like shredding multiple copies of a book into tiny pieces and then trying to figure out the text.
	But while this has been done for individual species, doing it for hundreds or thousands is expected to be much harder, like shredding and reconstructing multiple copies of multiple books. Dr. Venter says computer simulations indicate that it should be possible, at least for the Sargasso Sea.
	Many scientists still doubt that. But success is already being seen on more narrow communities. Dr. Jill Banfield, professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California at Berkeley, is studying the microbes found 400 feet underground at Iron Mountain, an abandoned mine in Northern California. The microbes contribute to the highly acidic runoff that has made the mine a major hazardous waste site under the federal Superfund program.
	Dr. Banfield, who is working with the Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute in nearby Walnut Creek, says there are probably just seven different species in the sample, either bacteria or archaea, another type of microbe that tends to inhabit extreme environments. The full genomes of the two organisms have already been determined.
