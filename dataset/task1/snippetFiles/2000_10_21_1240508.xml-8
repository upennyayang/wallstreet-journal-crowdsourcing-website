	Some of the other contrasts with 1956 are more obvious. It isn't only that most every male was sporting a fedora in 1956, or that the 15-cent price of a subway ride would be 10 times as much by the millennium. Series fans paid a top price of $10.50 for box seats in 1956 and spent only $2.10 to become bleacher creatures; this year, the ticket-price spread is $50 to $300 in some luxury boxes.
	The pre-suburbanized, pre-television-dominated, pre-automobile-oriented New York of 1956 was the nation's ''leading manufacturing city,'' said Dr. Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University, editor of the Encyclopedia of New York City. A premier port city in the pre-container era, New York was where the great liners still docked and the great trains still roared into the terminals.
	Employment was characterized ''by the white male union blue-collar worker,'' said Dr. Mike Wallace, a professor of history at John Jay College and co-author of ''Gotham: A History of New York to 1898,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize for history in 1999.
