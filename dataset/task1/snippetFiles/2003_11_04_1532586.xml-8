	To test the improvement, the researchers put the rodents through a ''sort of rat Olympics,'' said co-author Dr. Charles Goodlett, a professor of psychology at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis.
	During the first few runs through the course the rats often fell as they tried to traverse difficult obstacles, like parallel bars. Each time a rat lost balance and fell, its trainer would catch it and and put it back up on the obstacle until the rat figured out how to navigate on its own.
	Ultimately, when the trained, alcohol-exposed rats were tested on an obstacle course that they had never seen, they did as well as trained unexposed rats, Dr. Klintsova said, and they did better than untrained unexposed rats.
	Even though the trained rats had many more synapses per neuron than the untrained, the researchers found that compared with healthy rats, those exposed to alcohol had fewer neurons overall.
	''We're not saying that the training completely cured the rats,'' Dr. Klintsova said. ''But apparently the additional synapses per nerve cell were sufficient to increase learning and performance.''
	In a study at Emory University, researchers are trying to duplicate those results with children.
