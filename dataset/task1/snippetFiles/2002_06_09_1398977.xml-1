	Lucy Rinaldi, the PTA member who runs what the school calls the ''afters'' program, puzzled over how she would work a language class into the program. A previous effort had struggled with competing forces. Before school was band, orchestra, honors chorus. After school was arts and crafts and the more whimsical pursuits a child is apt to embrace. Mrs. Rinaldi, with the blessing of her PTA, settled on lunch time. She announced that the program, with instructors from the International Language School in Stamford, would start in April. One-third of the student body promptly signed up. Price: $160 for eight weeks, with scholarships available to those who couldn't pay.
	A few weeks later, her bright idea disintegrated. The Greenwich Time, the local newspaper, ran an article on the program. The head of the Greenwich teacher's union, Joanne Zammit, read the article and threatened to file an unfair labor practice complaint, saying that the contract doesn't allow classes to be taught by nonunion teachers during the school day.
	Roger Lulow, the Greenwich school superintendent, also read the article. He reacted with surprise: No one had told him about the program.
