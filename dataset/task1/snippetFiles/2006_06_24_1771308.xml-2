	''All I have to do is call up, and I'm in there and she's taking care of me,'' she said.
	It is not just a matter of moving to a small town. Ms. Kissell's doctor, Melissa Gerdes, is one of a rapidly growing number of physicians who have streamlined their schedules and added Internet services, among other steps, to better meet the needs of patients. For physicians like Dr. Gerdes, it is simply good business.
	Those doctors know that as walk-in medical offices and retail-store clinics pose new competition, and as shrinking insurance benefits mean patients are paying more of their own bills, family care medicine is more than ever a consumer-service business. And it pays to keep the customer satisfied.
	''It's about the patients -- making people well and keeping them well,'' said Dr. Gerdes, 35, who has had her own practice for seven years.
	Professional societies for family doctors and internists are urging their members to break with tradition by making it easier to schedule appointments -- or even making appointments unnecessary in the case of walk-in patients who need immediate attention.
