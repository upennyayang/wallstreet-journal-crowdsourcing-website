	Previous studies of satellite and submarine observations have seemed to establish a warming trend in the northern polar region and raise the possibility of a melting icecap.
	Scientists at the Goddard Space Science Institute, a NASA research center in Manhattan, compared data from submarines in the 1950's and 1960's with 1990's observations, demonstrating that the ice cover over the entire Arctic basin has thinned by 45 percent. Satellite images have revealed that the extent of ice coverage has significantly shrunk in recent years.
	Dr. McCarthy said he would report the encounter with open polar water to environmental scientists and consult other scientists to see if new satellite remote-sensing data have detected the extent of the melting.
	Recalling the reaction of passengers when they saw an iceless North Pole, he said: ''There was a sense of alarm. Global warming was real, and we were seeing its effects for the first time that far north.''
	In their models of climate patterns, scientists have long suggested that the northern polar region would be affected earlier and more seriously than the southern region.
	They said that the greater expanse of land in the northern hemisphere should respond more rapidly to temperature change, presumably leading to marked climate change.
