	Indeed, for many consumers, the Web has become a popular archiving method, especially when it comes to photos.
	Shutterfly.com and Ofoto.com have hundreds of millions of photographs on their computers. Shutterfly keeps a backup set of each photo sent to the site.
	The backups are stored somewhere in California ''off the fault line,'' said David Bagshaw, chief executive of Shutterfly.
	But suppose a Web-based business like Shutterfly goes out of business?
	Mr. Bagshaw said he preferred to look on the bright side, but offered this bit of comfort: ''No matter what the business circumstances, we'll always make people's images available to them.''
	Constant mobility can be another issue.
	Stephen Quinn, who teaches journalism at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., moves frequently because of his work. He prefers to keep the amount of paper in his life to a minimum, and rarely makes printouts.
	Dr. Quinn keeps a box in the bottom drawer of his desk that contains an eclectic set of storage disks dating back to the early 1980's, when he started out on an Amstrad computer.
	All of Dr. Quinn's poetry (''unpublished and unpublishable'' he says) and other writings are on those various digital devices, along with his daily diaries.
