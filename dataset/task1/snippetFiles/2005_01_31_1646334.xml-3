	With Ms. Doniger's interest in archetype, her invocations of Freud, her postmodern playfulness and her interest in exploring Hinduism from multiple perspectives, it was perhaps only a matter of time before her approach would run afoul of some of the more solemn currents in contemporary Hinduism. Though sexual imagery is found throughout Hinduism's baroque mythology, many groups would like to minimize its importance. They have different concerns: some with purity, some with Hindu power, some with minimizing the influence of ''Eurocentric'' commentators.
	In 2002, for example, Ms. Doniger and some former students were attacked in a 24,000-word essay on Sulekha.com, an ''online community'' for Indians. The essay, by Rajiv Malhotra, an entrepreneur whose foundation is devoted to improving the understanding of India in the United States, accused Ms. Doniger and her colleagues of Hindu bashing with their obsessive preoccupation with sexuality. That essay seems to have galvanized the opposition.
	A Sulekha.com article posted in 2002 accused Ms. Doniger of denigrating Hinduism in her article written for the Encarta encyclopedia. Microsoft, the encyclopedia's publisher, ended up replacing Ms. Doniger's contribution. Meanwhile threatening e-mail messages were sent to Ms. Doniger and her colleagues.
