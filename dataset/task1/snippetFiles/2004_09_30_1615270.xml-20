	What kind of mother would deny her daughter a garment that one of the most influential fashion designers of the last century described as the ''most successful non-cut-up body covering in history''?
	At www.oldnavy.com, I zeroed in on a girls' royal purple floral knit poncho, $26.50, from sizes extra small to extra-extra large.
	Is it possible to buy the wrong size poncho? I phoned customer service for guidance. The helpful customer service representative, when told my daughter wears size 6x, recommended the small size.
	I ordered it, paid for expedited shipping and received the package nearly a week before Clementine's birthday. But I didn't get around to wrapping presents -- or to opening the Old Navy package -- until the morning before her birthday.
	The poncho looked a little small.
	I wouldn't describe it as a blanket, exactly. More like a napkin
	I panicked.
	I ran to the expensive children's boutique. The $68 poncho in town had sold out. Dimly I remembered that gapkids.com had ponchos too. With the clock ticking, I drove to the nearest Gap Kids, rushed into the store as if delivering the Olympic torch and lunged at a rack of multistriped lamb's wool ponchos.
