	Overall, he said, he put more faith in academic analyses than one produced at a government's request, particularly at a time when the public appears eager to see signs of action on the issue.
	The release of the 700-page report, which was 16 months in the making, will come one week before the start of the latest round of talks on the Kyoto Protocol, the first international pact requiring cuts in heat-trapping emissions.
	The United States has not ratified the Kyoto pact but is a party to the voluntary treaty that preceded it, which requires all signatories to seek to avoid a dangerous buildup of greenhouse gases.
	The Kyoto Protocol, an addendum to the original treaty, requires three dozen participating industrialized countries to cut their combined emissions 5 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.
	At the moment, many of the three dozen industrialized countries bound by the pact are not on track to meet targets. And there are few indications of a shift toward accepting binding restrictions in the United States, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, or China and India, which are projected to be the dominant source of emissions in a couple of decades.
