	Some patients say that paying the extra money is worth it. ''Most doctors, it's one-two-three, they want to get rid of you,'' said Bernard Kessler, another of Dr. Younger's patients. Mr. Kessler, 86, had just finished a half-hour physical with the doctor. ''This doctor gives you as much time as you need.''
	Dr. Michael O. Fleming, a family physician in Shreveport, La., who is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said he sympathized with his fellow doctors who are feeling squeezed. But he said patients shouldn't have to pay extra for personal attention or help in managing their illnesses.
	''These are the things that should be covered within the relationship we already have with our patients,'' Dr. Fleming said.
	The practice of medicine has changed drastically in recent years, and medical advances have led to more complicated treatments. Managing the care of patients who may be on several medications at once, for example, often eats up more clinical and administrative time, too much of it not reimbursed under managed-care contracts.
	''The reimbursement system is starting to crumble,'' said Dr. John Goodson, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who has written extensively about care management issues.
