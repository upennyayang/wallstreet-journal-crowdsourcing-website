	Why does Rodriguez consume himself with study? Why did he seek out Bowa that night in Anaheim, a coach on an opposing team?
	''I have a strong need to get better,'' Rodriguez said one recent afternoon in Port Charlotte, Fla. ''I have a monster inside of me. I'm driven. I feel Larry Bowa was one of the best fielders of all time so I felt that a second opinion never hurts from a legend like Larry. Because he's at such a good angle as the third base coach, I thought perhaps he could give me a tip or two that could enhance my game, and it did. There's a few things he saw. He wanted me to be a little more aggressive, work on my rhythm.''
	Rodriguez worked on his rhythm. He still works on his rhythm, and everything else.
	''He's one of the hardest workers I've ever seen,'' said Mike Cameron, a Seattle teammate last season. ''He had it easy and still he went out and did his job every single day. When you see him doing all that stuff he doesn't have to do, it rubs off on you.''
