	The e-mail messages ''show Victor Conte communicating with professional athletes and coaches about steroids, defeating steroid testing, attempts to keep these activities covert and concealing financial transactions,'' Mr. Novitzky wrote in the affidavit.
	One e-mail message that was said to be written by Mr. Conte and sent to someone identified only as an elite track and field athlete warned the athlete not to use both ''cream'' and testosterone gel, saying the combination would cause a positive test result. ''Whoever told you that it is ok is a complete idiot,'' said the e-mail message, which later warned, ''Please understand that too much is just as bad as not enough. You are ready to rumble. It is time to run in the 49's.''
	The affidavit also said that among the retrieved garbage were two personal notes from an elite track and field athlete and world record holder. One dated March 24, 2003, read: ''Victor, Thank you for the help at nationals!'' The other, with the same date, said: ''Victor . . . Jim . . . Just wanted to let you know I appreciate everything that you did. All that I have accomplished this season would not have been possible without your support.
