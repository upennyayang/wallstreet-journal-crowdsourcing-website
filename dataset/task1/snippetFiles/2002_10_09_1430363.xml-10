	The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to examine the brains of 152 children, aged 5 to 18, who had A.D.H.D. and 139 normal children in the same age range. Forty-nine of the children with the disorder were scanned before they had received any medication to treat it.
	Critics have argued that Ritalin, Adderall and other drugs used to treat attention disorders were the cause of the size differences in brain areas reported in previous studies.
	According to some estimates, 1.3 million children from 5 to 14 in the United States, most of them diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, take Ritalin.
	But Dr. Castellanos and his colleagues found that, as in children who had taken medication, the total brain volume of children who had never been medicated was significantly smaller than that of children in the control group.
	''This study is so timely,'' said Dr. B. J. Casey, director of the Sackler Institute for Developmental Biology at Weill Medical College of Cornell University and an expert on pediatric brain imaging. ''We've all wanted to see a study like this.''
	White matter increases with age, and the unmedicated children tended to be younger than the other participants.
