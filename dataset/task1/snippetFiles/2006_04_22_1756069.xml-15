	Frances Beinecke, the council president, gives Ms. David credit for changing the public perception of environmentalists as somewhat overwrought tree huggers and for playing an enormous role in moving the global warming conversation ''off of the science page and squarely into the middle of American popular culture.''
	For instance, Elle magazine, which reaches a huge audience of avid consumers of the fashionable and the trendy, is ''green'' for May. Roberta Myers, Elle's editor in chief, approached her about being a guest editor, Ms. David said. Vanity Fair also has a ''green issue'' for May, Ms. David noted.
	''This is her great passion, she knows a lot about the environment, she's the fulcrum for a lot of activity,'' Ms. Myers said of Ms. David. ''It was just important to us that we get her voice.''
	Ms. David started her professional life as a talent coordinator for the David Letterman show (which is how she met Larry David) and now juggles her roles as wife, mother and activist from a home office. She travels extensively but generally limits her time away to three days. At 6 p.m., without fail, the whole family eats dinner together.
