	Ilan Stavchansky Slomianski has come a long way from the secluded, middle-class Jewish enclave of Mexico City where he grew up. There Ilan, the son of a popular Mexican soap opera star, attended Yiddish day school and celebrated the high holidays in synagogue. Other kids called him El Guerito (Little Blondie).
	Now El Guerito is known as Ilan Stavans (his father's stage name) and is a widely published writer and editor and one of the most influential figures in Latino literature in the United States. Indeed, when W. W. Norton, the foremost publisher of literary canons, wanted someone to produce a major anthology on Latino writing two years ago, it selected the 38-year-old Mr. Stavans, a professor of Spanish.
	To some Latino experts, Mr. Stavans is a welcome presence who is creating excitement about a long overlooked field of writing. To others, however, he is an ambitious interloper who is stealing attention from more deserving and seasoned scholars.
	''He's becoming the czar of Latino literature and culture,'' said Juan Flores, a professor of black and Puerto Rican studies at Hunter College.
	Well, Mr. Stavans says, he is what he is.
