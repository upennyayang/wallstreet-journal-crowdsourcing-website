	''We don't want to signal in any way that we are closing the book on this,'' Mr. Ashcroft said, adding that more indictments are possible.
	The 52-page affidavit, which was written by an Internal Revenue Service agent, accused Mr. Conte, Mr. Anderson, Mr. Valente and Mr. Korchemny of distributing a number of federally controlled substances, including steroids and human growth hormone, ''to numerous elite professional athletes at a local, national and international level.''
	The I.R.S. agent, Jeff Novitzky, said that Mr. Conte laundered the proceeds of the illicit sales through his personal bank account. Mr. Novitzky cited dozens of personal checks from unnamed athletes that had been deposited into Mr. Conte's personal account between February 2000 and May 2003.
	One check, for $6,200, was ''from the account of a current N.F.L. player,'' Mr. Novitzky said in his affidavit. Another, for $7,350, was ''from the bank account of an elite track and field athlete and Olympic gold medal winner,'' he wrote.
	Mr. Novitzky also said he had examined the trash discarded outside Balco's offices about once a week over many months.
