	Fear of death is an undercurrent of belief. The spirits of dead ancestors, ghosts, immortal deities, heaven and hell, the everlasting soul: the notion of spiritual existence after death is at the heart of almost every religion. According to some adaptationists, this is part of religion's role, to help humans deal with the grim certainty of death. Believing in God and the afterlife, they say, is how we make sense of the brevity of our time on earth, how we give meaning to this brutish and short existence. Religion can offer solace to the bereaved and comfort to the frightened.
	But the spandrelists counter that saying these beliefs are consolation does not mean they offered an adaptive advantage to our ancestors. ''The human mind does not produce adequate comforting delusions against all situations of stress or fear,'' wrote Pascal Boyer, a leading byproduct theorist, in ''Religion Explained,'' which came out a year before Atran's book. ''Indeed, any organism that was prone to such delusions would not survive long.''
	Whether or not it is adaptive, belief in the afterlife gains power in two ways: from the intensity with which people wish it to be true and from the confirmation it seems to get from the real world.
