	Several Wertheim family members died in concentration camps. Gunther Wertheim and his family survived, but he was in poor health and virtually penniless when they arrived in New Jersey in the early 1940's. He died in 1954. His brother Fritz, a death camp survivor, found a job as a cook in a mental institution.
	The loss of the stores might easily have been forgotten. Although Mrs. Principe's mother successfully sought restitution for the family's house outside Berlin, she did not tell her daughter the full story of the company. Her father was too bitter over his losses to say much about them, Mrs. Principe said.
	But in the early 1990's, Simone Ladwig-Winters, a graduate student at the Free University, discovered documents in an archive in Potsdam that showed how the Wertheim company's original Jewish owners were forced to give up their shares. In 1998, the Berlin Restitution Authority, which had issued compensation rulings on many East German properties stolen in the Nazi era, made her research part of its archive.
	In early 2000, one of Mrs. Principe's lawyers, Gary M. Osen, stumbled onto Ms. Ladwig-Winters's findings.
