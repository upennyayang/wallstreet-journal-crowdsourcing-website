	The other half goes to the anesthesiologist supervising the nurse, who must examine the patient beforehand but whose involvement thereafter may be minimal. A single anesthesiologist may be supervising, and receive payment for, up to four simultaneous operations in neighboring operating rooms.
	If the supervision requirement is dropped, hospitals and outpatient sites could save substantially; anesthesiologists earn an average of $240,000 a year, compared with the $94,000 or so for nurse anesthetists.
	Scrapping the federal rule would leave the issue in the hands of state regulators; 21 states now echo the Medicare rule in their own regulations. (New Jersey and Connecticut do, New York does not.) If the federal rule changes, states may see a green light to drop their own requirements, to help rein in costs and to allow hospitals more flexibility in staff selection.
	Anesthetists already work without anesthesiologists in some rural and inner-city facilities that cannot afford or cannot attract anesthesiologists. Nurses also work unsupervised in office settings like plastic surgery centers.
	In contrast, Ms. D'Andrea Knipe said, the job market for nurse anesthetists ''is red-hot right now.''
	CONGRESS may apply the brakes.
