	''But RHIC scientists should not feel badly about it,'' Dr. Panagiotou said. ''They will see new signs that we cannot see.''
	A RHIC physicist, Nu Xu, passed by just in time to hear Dr. Panagiotou's claim.
	''I don't buy it at all. It must be French propaganda,'' Dr. Xu said, scribbling out a diagram on a piece of paper and presenting it to Dr. Panagiotou as proof. ''The CERN people say if you cannot model it, it must be quark-gluon plasma. I disagree.''
	Lecturers at the conference were not as bold in laying claim to or refuting the CERN announcement.
	''The issue is that this is a coming-out party for RHIC,'' said William Zajc (rhymes with kites), the leader of the experimental team on one of the RHIC detectors, who added that RHIC scientists don't feel they have to one-up the CERN results. ''This is the major conference in our field in which one traditionally assesses the value of the experiments and the quality of their data. It's the first time the international community gets a look at the results from RHIC.''
	Scientists could opt out of some lectures and take a tour of RHIC, which sometimes resembled a Disney World shuttle ride.
