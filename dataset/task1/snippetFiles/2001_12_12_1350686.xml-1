	The report, a study of race riots this summer, said that Britons ''tiptoe'' around the subject of discrimination and that they needed to engage in an ''honest and robust debate'' on the subject to forestall further unrest.
	The authors of the inquiry, commissioned by Home Secretary David Blunkett, said they were dismayed and shocked by their findings.
	''Whilst the physical segregation of housing estates and inner-city areas came as no surprise,'' they said, ''the team was particularly struck by the depth of polarization of our towns and cities, and the extent to which these physical divisions were compounded by so many other aspects of our daily lives.
	''Many communities operate on the basis of a series of parallel lives,'' the authors said. ''These lives often do not seem to touch at any point, let alone overlap and promote any meaningful interchanges.''
	Linking this finding to the riots, the inquiry concluded, ''There is little wonder that the ignorance about each other's communities can easily grow into fear, especially when this is exploited by extremist groups.''
	According to the Office for National Statistics, Britain is 7.1 percent nonwhite, with 1.9 percent of the population categorized as black, 4 percent as Asian and 1.2 percent as ''other groups.''
