	Even so, the report raises larger questions about whether the commission's laxity at Indian Point 2 was an isolated case or part of something more widespread.
	''What you've got here is a very protective regulatory agency protecting the business it's supposed to be regulating,'' said Representative Sue W. Kelly, a Republican who represents the district and pushed for the investigation.
	In response, Neil A. Sheehan, a spokesman for the commission, said that ''we take very seriously the critical report of the agency's Inspector General of the handling of the Feb. 15 steam generator tube failure of Indian Point 2.'' He said that the N.R.C. chairman, Richard A. Meserve, had directed the commission's staff to do a comprehensive analysis of the Inspector General's criticisms and come up with recommendations for corrective actions by Nov. 1.
	Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Con Edison, said tonight that he had not yet seen the Inspector General's report. But he repeated the position that the company has held since February:
	''The inspection in 1997 was done with the most up-to-date technology available at its time,'' he said.
