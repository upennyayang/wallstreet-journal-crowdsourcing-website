	''The connection between players and fans was more personal and exciting,'' given the localized nature of New York in 1956, said Doris Kearns Goodwin, the historian and political scientist, who was 13 when she avidly followed the last Subway Series. Back in that facial-hair-free era when ears were unpierced and tongues were unstudded, many players lived among the folks. In 1956, the Dodger legend Pee Wee Reese occupied a modest brick duplex on Barwell Terrace in Bay Ridge, pitcher Sal Maglie lived in Riverdale and many Yankees occupied an apartment hotel on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. In their heyday, Dodger stars earned something like 10 times the $3,948 yearly average salary of the 1956 working man -- not an inconceivable difference, about $250,000 in today's dollars -- whereas even journeyman players bring down $2 million today. If there was more complexity in the tenor of those times, New York baseball in the 1950's seemed comfortingly uncomplicated. There was but one fierce loyalty and that was your family's, your neighborhood's, your borough's, team. Today it is baseball that has the high degree of difficulty, being but one option in a complex menu of sports entertainments.
