	David Wells, the Boston left-hander and former Yankee, said he considered, but decided against, using growth hormone in an attempt to recover from back problems in 2001, when he pitched for the Chicago White Sox. Major League Baseball had no drug-testing policy at the time.
	''It's a good thing I didn't do it,'' Wells said. ''I got a trainer. He said we could probably do without it.''
	Mike Flanagan, a former Cy Young award winner with the Baltimore Orioles and now the team's vice president for baseball operations, said he believed the pitchers who were using steroids were primarily fringe players. But for all players, he said, recovery time is critical in a sport that plays 162 games in 177 days.
	''That's why guys don't play until they're 50,'' said Flanagan, who is 53 and appears to be among the more well-informed executives on performance-enhancing drugs. ''It's recovery time. I'd still be playing if we played twice a week. That's what the end of your career is. It's not that you can't do it. You just can't do it six out of seven days anymore.''
