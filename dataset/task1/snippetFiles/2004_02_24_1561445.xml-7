	''If you want to be on top, you have to have broad shoulders,'' Bonds said. ''When you get on top, people want to knock you down. You have to be man enough to step up to the plate and be able and take it.''
	In December, Bonds was one of several professional athletes who testified before a federal grand jury investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, or Balco, a supplements company. Two Balco executives and a track coach were charged with Anderson.
	Bonds said that speculation about his connection to the case would not affect this season, but that the death of his father had been a great emotional hurdle for him.
	''I had a hard time getting back into the batting cage over the winter,'' he said. ''I had never got into the batting cage without him. He's been there my whole entire career. He would analyze my swing, my patterns, he'd watch tapes. Now I have to do it all alone, and I don't know if I can. I never had to before. My dad was always the eyes behind my head. Now Willie may have to be.''
