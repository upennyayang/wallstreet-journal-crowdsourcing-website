	In the regular season in 2005, Manning threw for 3,762 yards and 24 touchdowns with 17 interceptions. In 2006, he had 3,244 passing yards, 24 touchdowns and 18 interceptions.
	His passer rating moved to 77.0, 18th in the N.F.L., from 75.9. His completion percentage rose to 57.7, 21st in the league, from 52.8, while the average length of his completed passes dropped to 10.8 yards, ranked 28th, from 12.8. Put another way, Manning completed seven more passes in 2006 than in 2005, for 518 fewer yards.
	And, by the one measure that counts most -- victories -- Manning and the Giants dropped to 8-8 from 11-5.
	General Manager Ernie Accorsi, who pulled the draft-day trade with the San Diego Chargers for Manning in 2004, and who is retiring when this season ends, still believes Manning is a championship-caliber quarterback, the type of player to build around.
	What matters is what Accorsi's yet-to-be-named successor will think. Or the next coach, if Coughlin is dismissed.
	''Every game that we play he learns and he grows,'' Coughlin said of Manning.
