	Ms. Angier, who also played the scholarly busybody in her exhaustive 1990 book about Jean Rhys, sets out to do battle with such obstacles. Often relying on her favorite phrase, which is ''it seemed to me,'' she determines to probe every aspect of Levi's life and work, no matter how uncontroversial or small. The floodlight of her investigative powers is directed with equal vigor toward the low grade he once received in Italian class and his philosophical search for the meanings of manhood and survival.
	From melting at the ''tawny gaze'' of Levi's friend Alberto Salmoni to patronizing the women toward whom Levi had tender feelings, Ms. Angier is nothing if not relentless. In one case: ''I look at Gabriella, and I think, sadly: no. It wouldn't have worked. Primo needed sexual love, and she felt none for him. He needed unconditional love.'' With another woman, referred to as an ''admirable opponent,'' Ms. Angier attempts flat-out badgering. ''So really,'' the author says, ''it's not him you blame, it's yourself.'' Then she comments to the reader: ''She would never tell me her story; so I had decided to tell it to her.''
