	Ms. Henneberger's recent use was to contrast the general acceptance of Mr. Bradley's skin-insidership with the news media brouhaha over the Gore campaign's retention, purportedly for image guidance, of Naomi Wolf. She is the author who once noted that she wrote in ''the first-person sexual,'' a singular locution. Because her employment was concealed, her guidance that Vice President Gore act more like an alpha male -- mentioned only in passing, she says -- was seized on by pundits eager to ridicule any potential manipulation of images.
	Alpha male, I am informed by Edward Lucaire of New York, is a coinage of Rudolph Schenkel, who studied dominance hierarchies among captive wolves (no kin to the Gore consultant) at the zoo in Basel, Switzerland, in the 1930's. It is the term now used for ''top dog,'' employed by ethologists studying the micturation and mating habits of predatory canids. Among wolves, it seems that only the alpha males breed. We are now off on a tangent.
	Back to work. Of Ms. Wolf, Ms. Henneberger wrote, ''Her last book, 'Promiscuities,' is about girls sexually coming of age and prescribes heavy petting as an alternative to early intercourse.''
