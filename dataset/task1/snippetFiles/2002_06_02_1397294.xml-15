	The company suffered considerable losses when the California utilities crumbled and when Enron filed for bankruptcy protection, said Mr. Murphy, who was in charge of developing financial instruments to mitigate Williams's trading risks until he was dismissed in December 2001. He is now looking for work.
	Williams said Mr. Murphy initially seemed impressive, which is why it hired him. But the company said it later became clear that he lacked understanding of the company's business, and that his ''unfounded and evolving criticisms of Williams's energy marketing and trading business emerged only as he realized his employment was in jeopardy and subsequent to his termination.''
	E-mail messages sent months before Mr. Murphy was dismissed show that he and other Williams employees repeatedly and urgently warned Williams executives that the company had to reduce its trading risks, especially with shaky counterparties like Enron.
	But those warnings were apparently ignored, Mr. Murphy and others said. Blinkered by arrogance and an ignorance of the financial sophistication required to trade electricity, critics say, Williams executives thought the company and the deregulated power sector would thrive uninterrupted. Reducing risks, or hedging, takes away from the bottom line, the critics added.
