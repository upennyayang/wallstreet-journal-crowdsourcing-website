	Dr. Edgett said a possible explanation for the features was that water, kept liquid by an unknown means, would freeze and form an ice dam as it flowed from an underground source. The ice dam would retard the flow until there was enough force to break through the barrier, sending the water in a rapid cascade down the slope, much like a flash flood. The water would quickly freeze as its motion slowed and then would quickly boil off into gas because of the planet's low atmospheric pressure, he said, but not before spreading rocks and mud down the slope.
	Dr. Edward J. Weiler, NASA's chief scientist, said that if there were liquid water on Mars, it would have profound implications for the question of life on Mars, both in the past and today, and where to search for it. ''If life ever did develop there, and if it survives to the present time, then these landforms would be great places to look,'' he said.
	Dr. Weiler said the findings would have to be verified and explained if they were to become widely accepted. And he cautioned against exaggerating the discovery, alluding to some news reports on the find in recent days.
