	''Every game that we play he learns and he grows,'' Coughlin said of Manning. ''He's very aware of what is done properly, what isn't, and he's always trying to improve on that. And certainly he's spending a lot of time and focus on that this week.''
	Today's game is Manning's three-hour final exam, a chance to reshape his sagging reputation.
	''This game right here, how he plays, will determine how much heat he takes during the off-season,'' the reserve quarterback Tim Hasselbeck said.
	Manning's play dipped late in the 2005 season, ending with a dud of a performance in the playoffs. In a 23-0 first-round home loss to the Carolina Panthers, Manning was 10 of 18 for 113 yards with no touchdowns and 3 interceptions. The swoon dogged him and motivated him in the off-season.
	His play has been marginally more consistent in 2006. Yet Manning could not rescue the Giants from their late-season slump, when they lost six of their last eight games.
	''I like Eli Manning,'' the NBC football analyst John Madden said in a conference call Thursday.
