	And in research described in today's Science article, Dr. Sarah Mathews and Dr. Michael Donoghue of Harvard University used a new technique to look into the group's history. The researchers studied a gene that had duplicated itself into two copies in the earliest flowering plants, providing two independent road maps to the evolution of the group -- maps that, as the researchers expected, turned out to be very similar.
	The scientists say the new findings do not indicate which nonflowering plant sprouted earth's first flower. And, while nearly all researchers have enthusiastically accepted the new work, a few have sounded cautionary notes over the answer to this question, which has been so problematic in the past.
	For example, Dr. William L. Crepet, a paleobotanist at Cornell University, said he would not be shocked if there were some shifting around in these early branches of the family tree as studies continued, but he added, ''It looks pretty good for Amborella right now.''
	For biologists seeking a window into the early evolution of flowering plants, the new findings are invaluable. Of particular interest is Amborella, the bush catapulted from obscurity to botanical stardom.
