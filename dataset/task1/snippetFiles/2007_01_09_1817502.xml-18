	Modern humans, we love to alter our skin. You'll find very few people walking around today with unadorned skin. They might make permanent changes -- piercing, scarring, tattooing -- to memorialize events and announce their identity. Or they might use cosmetics for temporary alterations to announce their attractiveness, mood or sexual availability. The bottom line: humans are the self-decorating ape. Q. I get the feeling that you think cosmetic use is some kind of ancient evolutionary behavior. Are we reading you correctly? A. Evolution is all about attracting a mate and getting a chance to reproduce, so yes, makeup helps with that. When a woman uses eyeliner to make her eyes appear larger, she's giving off a message: ''I want you to see me as attractive.'' Large eyes in a woman are almost universally seen as appealing. This is not just a girl thing. Male body paint in East Africa emphasizes forbidding facial expressions. They announce a man's prowess as a warrior and as a mate. Q. How do you feel about your own skin? A. I like it. It is my unwritten biography. Q. You made news in 2004 when you discovered the world's oldest chimpanzee fossil.
