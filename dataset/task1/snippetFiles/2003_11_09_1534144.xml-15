	Kevles, who teaches history at Yale University, also examines the role of women in the Russian space program, which, the hype and head start notwithstanding, was hardly a utopia of egalitarianism. The first female astronaut, Valentina Tereshkova, apparently was chosen as much because Nikita Khrushchev liked her looks and working-class background as because of anything else. Her flight had enough glitches that Sergei Korolev, Russia's chief of rocket design and space technologies, is said to have sworn never to ''get involved with broads again.'' Indeed, it would be 19 years before another Soviet woman would fly into space.
	TWENTY years after its birth, NASA at last invited women to apply to its astronaut program as ''mission specialists,'' and at least 1,500 did. From that pool the agency selected a pioneer class of six, each a woman of outstanding accomplishment: a heart surgeon, an electrical engineer, an astrophysicist, a geologist. All, intriguingly, were oldest daughters, with highly supportive parents. All were quite accustomed to working with men, having come from fields where they often were the only woman on the block. Only one, Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, considered herself a feminist.
