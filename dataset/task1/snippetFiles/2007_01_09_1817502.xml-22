	A. I like it. It is my unwritten biography. My skin reminds me that I'm a 53-year-old woman who has smiled and furrowed her brow and, on occasion, worked in the desert sun too long. I enjoy watching my skin change because it's one of the few parts of my body that I can watch. We can't view our livers or heart, but this we can. And yes, I use cosmetics. Like other humans, I have a penchant for changing my appearance easily and quickly. It also helps me feel more confident. That may seem silly, but I still do it.
	Q. You made news in 2004 when you discovered the world's oldest chimpanzee fossil. These were chimp teeth about a half-million years old. Where did you find them?
	A. In a drawer at the National Museum of Kenya in Nairobi. I was rummaging through this bag labeled ''fossil monkeys'' and I saw it. ''This doesn't look like monkey,'' I thought. It turned out they were from an early chimp. That find proved important because there had been no chimpanzee this old in the fossil record.
