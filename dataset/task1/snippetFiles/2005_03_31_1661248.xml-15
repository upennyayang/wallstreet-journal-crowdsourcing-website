	''It's wrong; he made another mistake,'' Botta said. ''It's something he should have told us about.''
	Botta said Pellman had apologized to him.
	Pellman, who is 51 and practices as an internist in Lake Success on Long Island, did not respond to phone and e-mail messages seeking further comment yesterday.
	Greg Aiello, an N.F.L. spokesman, said Pellman would continue advising Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's office on a range of medical issues, as he has since 2001.
	''He has demonstrated a strong commitment to research and state-of-the-art understanding of medical care in sports,'' Aiello wrote in an e-mail message. ''His peers several years ago elected him president of the N.F.L. Physicians Society, and he has proven to be very effective working with team medical staffs and the N.F.L. Players Association.''
	The Jets said Pellman would continue as chairman of the team's medical department.
	''The Jets have maintained an outstanding professional relationship with Dr. Pellman, and his work with our organization is invaluable to the health and well-being of our players, coaches and staff,'' the team said in a statement.
