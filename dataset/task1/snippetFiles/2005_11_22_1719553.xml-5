	''We don't have a lot more time to deal with climate change,'' said Mr. Paulson, an outspoken environmentalist who is also chairman of the Nature Conservancy. ''We need the right balance between regulation and market-based approaches.''
	Goldman is not the first financial services firm to adopt an environmental policy. In response to a 2003 campaign led by the Rainforest Action Network, more than 30 commercial banks signed the Equator Principles, which call for them to assess environmental risk before financing a project.
	This year, J. P. Morgan Chase set out strict environmental dos and don'ts for each part of its business. And Merrill Lynch now includes environmental issues in the due-diligence checklist its bankers use before underwriting stock issues.
	But environmental advocates say that the Goldman policy keeps going where others leave off.
	''They are spending intellectual capital and energy on finding market-based solutions to environmental problems,'' said Michelle Chan-Fishel, program manager for green investments at Friends of the Earth.
	Jonathan Lash, president of the World Resources Institute, was more blunt. ''Goldman has given us things to measure them by,'' he said.
	The Goldman policy is certainly the most explicit.
