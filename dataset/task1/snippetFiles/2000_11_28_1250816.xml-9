	Likewise, little excitement was generated by a placebo-controlled study of 20 patients with chronic low back pain published in March in The Journal of the American Medical Association, which found no statistically significant difference in pain relief between those using real and sham bipolar magnets.
	Most studies purporting to show positive results either lacked a placebo control or could not be sure patients were unaware of who was wearing real magnets. For example, in a pilot study at Vanderbilt University Medical Center of 16 patients with knee pain caused by rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis, magnet therapy for one week resulted in a 67 percent reduction in pain. But the study lacked a placebo group for comparison.
	In a study of back and knee pain among 54 patients in Texas and Alabama who were treated with quadrapolar magnet therapy or a look-alike placebo, in just one day those receiving magnet therapy experienced significantly greater pain relief. But the researchers said that ''patient blindness'' to who received which treatment ''cannot be assured,'' because patients could use a paper clip or safety pin to determine whether the devices they were wearing were real or fake.
