	This is not some wood-fired boiler. It is an $18 million gasification project that will heat the wood, mostly chips and bark, to produce a flammable gas, which will be burned in a turbine that resembles a jet engine. And the university will not run it on clippings from trees at the Columbia campus; it will take 14 tractor-trailer loads a day, about 55,000 tons a year.
	Because the wood is gasified but not burned, the system, which is similar to one used in Burlington, Vt., produces less nitrogen oxides and less soot than a boiler would, said Jonathan S. Rhone, chief of the Nexterra Energy Corporation of Vancouver, British Columbia, which built the gasifier. But being that clean requires an industrial-size system.
	There is another reason that it is not the kind of project that works on a small basis: it will take about 14 years to pay for itself. ''We've been here 200 years,'' said Helen Zeigler, the university business manager. ''We can afford to make investments like this.'' A 14-year payback would never work on a family budget, she said.
