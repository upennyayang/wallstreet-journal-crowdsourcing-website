	Randall, though, argues that without any experimental feedback, string theorists may never reach their goal. She prefers a different strategy, called model building. Rather than seeking to create an all-encompassing theory, she develops models -- mini-theories that target specific testable problems and that might then point the way to a more general theory.
	The models that Randall and her collaborator Raman Sundrum have been building may explain one of the greatest mysteries in physics: why is gravity so weak compared with the other forces in the universe? Gravity's weakness may not seem obvious, but as Randall writes, ''A tiny magnet can lift a paper clip, even though all the mass of the earth is pulling it in the opposite direction.'' The electromagnetic force is a trillion trillion trillion times as powerful as gravity.
	To account for gravity's feebleness, Randall and Sundrum borrow some ideas from string theory but add their own twist. What if, they ask, higher dimensions are not small and curled up but large, perhaps infinite in size? Would there be any observable consequences? So they build models of what the universe might look like if it consisted of objects called branes (short for ''membranes'').
