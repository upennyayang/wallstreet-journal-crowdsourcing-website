	Now, researchers at the University of Massachusetts and Stanford have determined that lightning bolts that have accompanying sprites have a distinct electrical signature. The scientists studied a 1996 storm in Kansas, videotaping the sprites and noting the duration of the electrical currents from the lightning. Bolts that were accompanied by a sprite lasted much longer than those that were not.
	The researchers, who reported their results in the April issue of Geophysical Research Letters, say that with just four relatively low-cost receivers the number of sprites could be counted for the entire Western hemisphere. Determining their number may help determine what effect, if any, sprites have on the chemistry of the atmosphere.
	Electrical Cleanup
	Electricity in the ground, not the atmosphere, may have an effect on the chemistry of contaminated industrial sites, helping to clean up them up.
	Researchers from Monsanto, General Electric and Du Pont have tested a method of removing trichloroethylene, a common industrial solvent, from soil by running an electric current through it. The method, known as ''lasagna'' technology because of the layered treatment zones within the soil, uses electrodes buried up to 45 feet in the ground.
