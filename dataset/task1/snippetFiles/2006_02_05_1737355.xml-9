	Part dreamer and part realist, Mr. Musk says he was drawn to the project not only because he has long been fascinated by space -- he has a degree in physics from the University of Pennsylvania -- but also because he sees a market opportunity in America's declining share of the world's satellite-launching business. In the commercial market, the United States' two big rocket giants, Lockheed Martin and Boeing, have been priced out by lower-cost competitors from Russia, Ukraine and France. Lockheed's Atlas 5 had only one commercial order in 2005, compared with 22 in 1998. Boeing has withdrawn its Delta 4 rocket from the commercial market and relies exclusively on business from the United States government. At stake is a market that was worth $4 billion last year, when governments and businesses paid for 55 launchings, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Of those, 18 were commercial, with a value of $1 billion. American companies compete for commercial orders only by teaming with foreign partners -- often former cold-war foes. Lockheed has teamed up with Khrunichev State Research of Russia to form International Launch Services, which mainly uses Russia's Proton rockets.
