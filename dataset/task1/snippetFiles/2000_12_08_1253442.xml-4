	Dr. Donald Kennedy, a Stanford University professor of environmental science who is editor of Science, said the issue arose in June when Celera and the publicly financed Human Genome Project were on the verge of announcing that they had each determined virtually the entire sequence of the genetic script that makes up a human being. Dr. Kennedy wanted to publish papers from the two groups describing this achievement. Ordinarily, the authors of such a paper would be expected to put all their data into GenBank, a database maintained by the National Institutes of Health. The Human Genome Project had been putting its data there all along, as it acquired the genetic sequences. But Celera would not put its data in GenBank, saying it feared that other companies, including its competitors, could simply take the fruits of its work free, even annotating and selling the entire human genome sequence. ''The bottom line,'' Dr. Samuel Broder, Celera's executive vice president for medical affairs, said, ''is that we want to make sure that the work and considerable effort is put to the benefit of the people who took the risk to invest in Celera.
