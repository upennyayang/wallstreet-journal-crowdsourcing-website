	Other space experts agree. Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University in Washington, said that the only shuttle alternatives that existed were on paper and that he believed the current spacecraft would continue flying for 15 to 20 years. ''The shuttle is the only re-usable, manned spacecraft that we've got,'' he said.
	John E. Pike, space policy expert for the Federation of American Scientists, said the shuttle could be the spacecraft equivalent of the much-modified B-52 bomber, which the Air Force recently said could remain in service more than 70 years after its introduction. ''The shuttle could continue flying like the B-52, with the only limit being its airframe life,'' Mr. Pike said.
	Daniel S. Goldin, the administrator of NASA, said the versatility of the shuttle made it difficult to find alternatives, particularly for servicing the international space station now being constructed in orbit. People have suggested alternative vehicles that would only carry crews to and from the station, or that would serve as unpiloted cargo haulers, but no proposal is up to all the shuttle's jobs, he told reporters last month.
