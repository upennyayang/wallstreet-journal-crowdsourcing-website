	''He's one of the hardest workers I've ever seen,'' said Mike Cameron, a Seattle teammate last season. ''He had it easy and still he went out and did his job every single day. When you see him doing all that stuff he doesn't have to do, it rubs off on you.'' His work ethic, Rodriguez said, was acquired from his mother, Lourdes Navarro. ''When our backs were against the wall,'' he said, ''she went out and got two and sometimes three jobs to keep us above water. I was under the impression we were middle class or very high class because we had everything we ever needed. It was because of her tireless work.'' Navarro raised her son by herself, and he has become an impressive young man. He is only 25 years old. ''When I met him, I thought he was a grown-up man,'' Cal Ripken said, recalling how they met when Rodriguez was a high school senior in Miami. ''I remember shaking his hand and talking to him a little bit. I was impressed with how he handled himself, how he presented himself physically and emotionally.''
