	Moreover, most biologists concur that the human capacity for language and memory allows altruistic behavior -- the desire to give, and to sacrifice for the sake of others -- to flourish in measure far beyond the cooperative spirit seen in other species.
	With language, they say, people can learn of individuals they have never met and feel compassion for their suffering, and honor and even emulate their heroic deeds. They can also warn one another of any selfish cheaters or malign tricksters lurking in their midst.
	''In a large crowd, we know who the good guys are, and we can talk about, and ostracize, the bad ones,'' said Dr. Craig Packer, a professor of ecology and evolution at the University of Minnesota. ''People are very concerned about their reputation, and that, too, can inspire us to be good.''
	Oh, better than good.
	''There's a grandness in the human species that is so striking, and so profoundly different from what we see in other animals,'' he added. ''We are an amalgamation of families working together. This is what civilization is derived from.''
	At the same time, said biologists, the very conditions that encourage heroics and selflessness can be the source of profound barbarism as well.
