	The average surface temperature of the globe has risen by about 1 degree Fahrenheit over the last 100 years. Over the last 25 years, the rate of surface warming has accelerated, amounting to the equivalent of about 3.5 degrees a century. By comparison, the world is 5 to 9 degrees warmer now than in the depths of the last ice age, 18,000 to 20,000 years ago.
	Scientists generally agree that it is unclear how much of the warming is attributable to greenhouse gases and how much to natural causes; many think both are involved.
	The new study shows that the average warming of the seas over the 40-year study period amounted to about one-tenth of a degree Fahrenheit for the top 1.9 miles of ocean water as a whole, and more than half a degree in about the top 1,000 feet.
	It is possible that the ocean may now be giving up to the atmosphere some of the heat it stored in the early part of the study period, but this has not been established, said Sydney Levitus, the chief author of the study.
