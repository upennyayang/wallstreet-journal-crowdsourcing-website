	But Nancy Pirtle of Muttontown, whose family bequeathed Nassau Hall to the county, said she had to go to her costume closet to find a hat to wear to the meeting.
	''I like my riding hat and my gardening hat,'' Ms. Pirtle said. But she was pleased that a hat event would draw attention to the county's once glorious mansions.
	''The net result is not a hat luncheon,'' Ms. Pirtle said. ''It is restoring a garden or part of a house.''
	Monica Randall, director of the North Shore Preservation Society, wore a decades-old garden party-style hat with a spray of lavender flowers. ''There were a lot of society women on the North Shore who were hat nuts,'' said Ms. Randall, author of ''Mansions of the Gold Coast'' (Rizzoli International, 2004). As a teenager in the 1960's, Ms. Randall, of Oyster Bay, salvaged dozens of hats from steamer trunks in mansions about to be bulldozed. She planned to display several hats from her Gold Coast Museum collection at the luncheon.
	''It was a big part of the social life,'' Ms. Randall said, referring to millinery couture. ''They played croquet and they had high teas and you didn't go to church in those days without a hat.''
