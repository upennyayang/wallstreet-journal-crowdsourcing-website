	''Random House? Never, never, never will this jewel ever be brought public,'' he said. ''Unthinkable.''
	As he spoke, Mr. Middelhoff's comments were interrupted occasionally by the throbbing vibrations of a band performing in a nearby room for executives from Bertelsmann's music business, whose labels include Arista, RCA and Windham Hill. But he pressed on, repeatedly stressing that the company must move rapidly. ''We have to become No. 1 in all our content businesses and we have to be No. 1 as far as the media and E-commerce business is concerned,'' he said. ''Worldwide.''
	This week's offering of Barnesandnoble.com, he said, is an example of that new aggressiveness. The two partners are planning to sell 25 million shares, or about 18 percent of the company. Each will retain about a 41 percent interest in the new company. (Barnes &amp; Noble has a business tie to The New York Times, selling books through links from the newspaper's Web site.)
	Mr. Middelhoff is also tending to the political aspects that will come with owning a publicly traded company.
	He is considering offering some sort of stock options to all Bertelsmann managers to avoid creating two classes of executives within the corporation.
