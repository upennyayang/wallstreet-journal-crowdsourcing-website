	This process of organization and cosmic evolution has been caught in action by yet another team of astronomers that is using the 10-meter-diameter Keck II telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, to study galaxies as they existed seven billion years ago, when the universe was half its age.
	The first results from the survey were released in Sydney as maps of the locations of distant galaxies in three small patches of sky studied by the Keck telescope. The maps show that galaxies back then were less tightly clustered in groups and chains than they are today, the astronomers said.
	''We've seen evolution in clustering,'' said Dr. Sandra M. Faber of the University of California at Santa Cruz, adding that is further confirmation of the hierarchical ''bottom-up'' model of structure formation favored by theorists.
	Dr. Faber is a leader of the team known as DEEP2 that is also led by Dr. Marc Davis of the University of California at Berkeley and includes astronomers from other institutions. By the time the three-year project is completed, the scientists expect to have measured 60,000 galaxies to a distance of nine billion light-years.
