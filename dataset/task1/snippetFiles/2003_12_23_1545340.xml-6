	By using computer simulations, which sped up the collisions, Mr. Schwämmle found that the crucial variable was height. Smaller barchan dunes often bump into larger ones from behind because they move faster and are carried by winds blowing in one direction. The unidirectional winds are also what give barchans, which can range from several feet to over 30 feet in height, their characteristic crescent shapes.
	Desert ecologists have generally believed that once a dune merges with another, it is completely absorbed because it cannot pass through the side of the second dune that faces away from the wind, called the slip face.
	''The slip face doesn't get any wind, and you need wind to move a dune so it makes sense that nothing can pass through there,'' Mr. Schwämmle said.
	But when two dunes are close enough in size, they can create the illusion that one slithers right through the other.
	The slightly smaller one, approaching from behind, swallows so much sand as it begins to fuse with the larger, more sluggish barchan that at some point it becomes bigger. The dune that was initially larger is now small enough to dart away.
