	Mr. Hooper suggested that the contamination might have come from an experimental oral polio vaccine prepared at the Wistar Institute, a research center in Philadelphia. Scientific papers published at the time did not say what primate tissues were used to make the vaccine, Mr. Hooper wrote. The institute has denied that its scientists used chimpanzee cells to prepare the vaccine.
	After the theory was raised in 1992 in an article in Rolling Stone, the institute appointed an independent committee led by Dr. Claudio Basilico, chairman of the microbiology department at New York University, to look into the history. The panel recommended testing the remaining vaccine stores. Wistar did not carry out the tests then, it has said, because of a lack of scientific interest. Mr. Hooper's thesis was not widely accepted, but it led to calls for tests.
	In February, Wistar provided the tiny quantities of remaining polio vaccine to Dr. Vincent Racaniello at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University.
	Dr. Kwok tested the samples for the presence of H.I.V. and S.I.V., its simian cousin. Dr. Paabo tested for the presence and species origin of two types of DNA.
