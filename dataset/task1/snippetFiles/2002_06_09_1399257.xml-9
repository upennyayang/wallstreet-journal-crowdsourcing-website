	''We've been here all along, but we were just too ashamed to say anything about it,'' said Mike Kozlowski, a director of the JoeNetsfan.com Web site. ''But we can come out of the closet now.''
	They're not quite kicking the door down, however. Gains in attendance were only modest for most of the season, and the Nets were still among the bottom quarter of the N.B.A.'s teams in average attendance.
	Part of that disparity is because those teams simply play better basketball; the Sixers were in the finals last year, and the Knicks have been perennial contenders in recent years. Part of it can be attributed to the somewhat isolated placement of the team's arena in the Meadowlands, a location that is also home to better-performing football and hockey franchises, like the Giants and the Devils.
	''It's not easy to go see them,'' Dr. Truchil said. ''There's no mass transit, the Meadowlands aren't very accessible, it's not centrally located for people in the rest of the state.''
	Likewise, because the team plays up in one corner of the state, it does not figure prominently in the region's sporting consciousness.
