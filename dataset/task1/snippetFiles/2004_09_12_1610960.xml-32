	''In the last five years, we've moved the date of documented evidence back from 1846 to 1791, which is huge,'' Mr. Thorn, who discovered the Pittsfield ordinance, said. ''And we keep finding more clues. There is the evidence that has been cited from the Plymouth Plantation. The prospect of lassoing the origin of baseball more closely is good. Just because we don't have box scores and baseball cards from a team called the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock doesn't mean baseball wasn't happening there.''
	Perhaps there is some link there, and finding baseball's origin will now become a popular crusade, a sister cause to Americans' recent fascination with their historical forefathers.
	''I guess the searching could go in any direction,'' Ms. Goodwin said, ''though it's hard to imagine John Adams playing baseball. But you never know.''
	You never know. Sort of like the baseball history version of Yogi Berra's ''It ain't over till it's over.''
	On Page 31 of David McCullough's biography ''John Adams,'' Adams describes in his diary his idyllic boyhood activities: ''making and sailing boats'' and ''swimming, skating, flying kites and shooting marbles, bat and ball.''
