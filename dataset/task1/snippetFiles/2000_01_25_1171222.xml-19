	At Bronx Science, where ''it was considered very uncool not to have learned calculus on your own,'' he began to blossom as a physics student, particularly after he encountered a popular book by Sir James Jeans that mentioned quantum physics, and its mysterious equations and engrossing idea that nature was based on simple but powerful laws.
	''There was something at the bottom that was much simpler than the appearance,'' he said. ''That was the cutting edge of knowledge.''
	He attended Cornell on scholarship, where he studied physics and fell in love with a fellow student, after hearing her sing in a student production. They married and today Louise Weinberg is a professor of law at the University of Texas.
	After a ''wonderful, romantic first year'' in Copenhagen, where he did research at what is now called the Niels Bohr Institute, the couple returned to the United States, where he earned his Ph.D. at Princeton and worked at a series of universities, including Columbia, the University of California at Berkeley, M.I.T. and Harvard, where Ms. Weinberg studied law. In 1980, she won an appointment at the law school at the University of Texas and in 1982, he followed her there.
