	Peter D. Kramer: I think it's a problem for therapy. I think that the power of therapy depends on novelty and surprise. And the enormous openness about sexuality, jealousy, violent thoughts and so on impoverishes therapy to some extent. I think therapy was probably easier to do when it was more surprising to speculate, as Freud did, that the patient may have sexual feelings of which he or she is unaware. That wouldn't shock anyone -- it wouldn't be transformative anymore.
	Q: So as opposed to opening up other possibilities, you feel that having gotten those kind of basic surprises out of the way lessens the possibilities for what can be discussed in therapy?
	Kramer: I think that one of the great jobs of psychotherapy is to create a place where very shameful aspects of the self can safely be revealed. So I think it lessens the force of revelation that so much is already revealed.
	Martin S. Bergmann: Cultural changes do in some way affect what patients talk about. To give an example, I have had experience with patients who develop cancer or other disabling diseases and then look upon themselves as ''damaged goods.''
