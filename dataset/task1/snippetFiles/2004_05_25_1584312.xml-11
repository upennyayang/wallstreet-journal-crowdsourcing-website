	Dr. Tonry responded that a robot would have more time to work than an astronaut would have, and that operators on the ground would be in control of the robots anyway.
	Dr. David S. Leckrone, the Hubble project scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center, said, ''We won't open the doors unless we are confident we can close them.''
	Much of the three-day meeting was a recital of Hubble's recent accomplishments, in fields from planetary science to the evolution of the universe, as a way of advertising its unique capabilities.
	For example, with its clear vision, Hubble has picked out the glint of the exploding stars known as supernovas, billions of light-years out in space and time. This year, using these cosmic disasters as distance indicators, a team of Hubble astronomers confirmed the strange discovery six years ago that some ''dark energy'' was accelerating the expansion of the universe.
	''We're not interested anymore in asking 'Is the universe accelerating?''' said Dr. Tonry of Hawaii, discussing this finding. ''We want to know why it is accelerating. What is this stuff?''
	The race is on, he said, to pin down the properties of dark energy by finding more supernovas out in the void before Hubble dies.
