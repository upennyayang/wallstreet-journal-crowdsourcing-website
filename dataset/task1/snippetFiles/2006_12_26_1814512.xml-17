	But as Professor Taylor points out, secular dogmatism is equally irrational.
	Perhaps that is why our public school systems have never been able to respond imaginatively to the ample room created by the Supreme Court in the 1960s. The rulings on prayer in school and on Bible reading were accompanied by a clear invitation to consider the role of religion in the historical development of the country.
	How painful it is to acknowledge that the God-given gift of reason is depreciated where one would expect it to be honored.

	To the Editor:
	Like Mark C. Taylor, I have long tried to encourage students to reflect critically about faith. My experience with the ''religiously correct,'' however, was different from his.
	Several years ago I remarked in a lecture to 150 undergraduates that I was an atheist. Every day for the rest of the semester I was besieged after class by a bevy of earnest proselytizers who sought to save me from eternal damnation.
	Sadly they weren't at all interested in engaging in the dialogue that Professor Taylor rightly suggests is essential for genuine learning and for attenuating social conflicts.
