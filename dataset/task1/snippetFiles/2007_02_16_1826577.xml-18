	But William Woodward, chief executive of Anthem Venture Partners, based in Santa Monica, Calif., counters that the value of donating to a prize could extend beyond the guarantee of an ownership stake. Mr. Woodward, who has been approached by the X Prize Foundation about participating in its new program but hasn't yet made up his mind, said the concept could help spur development in industries that have been sluggish because of political reasons. ''Like stem cells, which is an area I'm passionate about,'' Mr. Woodward said. In general, he said, prizes, ''can keep the science moving forward.'' Mr. Vander Ark said his aspirations are not just about science, but viable businesses. For instance, the foundation already has plans to award a $25 million prize for a car that gets 100 miles a gallon, but the vehicle must be in production to get the award. The awards, he said, have an opportunity to generate press attention and buzz, and in turn to motivate a greater number of engineers and entrepreneurs than individual venture capitalists or their firms might be able to do. For the superefficient automobile, the foundation even envisions a made-for-TV road race and finale.
