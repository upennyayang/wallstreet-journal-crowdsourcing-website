	The success of women in physics also varies widely from country to country. In France and Turkey, women account for more than a quarter of physics Ph.D. degrees, as against only a tenth of physics Ph.D.'s in Germany and Switzerland.
	Dr. Ivie also said that in suggesting that men and women might have different intrinsic aptitude in science, Dr. Summers did not take into account the continuing progress of women in fields like physics. While women earned only 18 percent of the Ph.D.'s in the United States in 2003, that is far higher than 1970, when the percentage was 2.4.
	''If it's differences in innate ability, I don't know what innate abilities would have changed so quickly,'' Dr. Ivie said.
	Dr. Judy R. Franz, executive officer of the American Physical Society, said she was surprised by Dr. Summers's response to a question about why there were more women among the top physicists in France.
	''I was amazed that he did not know anything about the international scene,'' she said. ''This is clearly a cultural effect. He assumed the pressures were higher in the United States than in Europe.
