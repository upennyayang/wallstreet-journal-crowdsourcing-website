	Rituals are a way of signaling a sincere commitment to the religion's core beliefs, thereby earning loyalty from others in the group. ''By donning several layers of clothing and standing out in the midday sun,'' Sosis wrote, ''ultraorthodox Jewish men are signaling to others: 'Hey! Look, I'm a haredi' -- or extremely pious -- 'Jew. If you are also a member of this group, you can trust me because why else would I be dressed like this?' '' These ''signaling'' rituals can grant the individual a sense of belonging and grant the group some freedom from constant and costly monitoring to ensure that their members are loyal and committed. The rituals are harsh enough to weed out the infidels, and both the group and the individual believers benefit. In 2003, Sosis and Bradley Ruffle of Ben Gurion University in Israel sought an explanation for why Israel's religious communes did better on average than secular communes in the wake of the economic crash of most of the country's kibbutzim. They based their study on a standard economic game that measures cooperation. Individuals from religious communes played the game more cooperatively, while those from secular communes tended to be more selfish.
