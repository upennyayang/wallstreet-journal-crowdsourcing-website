	But using highly refined diagnostic devices like PET -- or positron emission tomography -- scanning and functional magnetic resonance imaging, or f.M.R.I., scientists have been able for the first time to peer deep into the brain and watch pain at work, ''lighting up'' specific neurons.
	In studies of 14 patients, Dr. A. Vania Apkarian and a team of neurologists, physicists and technicians at Syracuse have used f.M.R.I. to locate cell groups in the cerebral cortex that are activated in response to severe pain in the hand, in various back muscles and in spinal cord or nerve tissues.
	Dr. Apkarian emphasized that it may be several years before the mountains of computerized data the team has collected can be analyzed and then used to improve or alter treatment.
	But, he said, the early results seem highly promising, especially when combined with knowledge of brain chemistry gained during the 1980's and the availability of more effective painkillers.
	Other research teams in this country and in Canada are conducting similar studies.
	Dr. Howard Field, a neurologist and pain expert at the University of California at San Francisco, called the work of Dr. Apkarian, Dr. Davis and others ''a major revolution in medicine.''
