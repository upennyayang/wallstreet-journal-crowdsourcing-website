	A. I got interested in mad cow disease via chronic wasting disease in deer and elk. I went on the Internet and found information that was just an eye-opener to me involving the risks to wildlife and humans. The scientist who was maintaining the site had other things to do, so I sort of took it over. I meant to add a few links and stories, but here I am five years later. The story never died.
	Q. What do you want to achieve with the Web site on mad cow disease?
	A. In 1996 the Web was just getting started. I wanted to do a disease Web site that showed how the Internet could be used to do original research based on published information and how it can become the scientific medium of the future. As the paradigm for a disease Web site, madcow carries news and has unlimited space for scientific papers, complex graphics, annotations and interactive models. I would not carry nearly so much news on the Web site if the news would only let up.
	Q. Who visits the Web site on mad cow disease?
