	''In this area, with its special difficulties, birds seem to be able to use the sun in long-distance migration,'' Dr. Alerstam said. ''That's a really new thing.''
	Dr. Kenneth P. Able, a professor at the State University of New York at Albany, who has studied bird navigation for decades, said that little had been known about how shorebirds navigated, largely because they are difficult to work with in a laboratory and because they migrate across inaccessible areas. ''We don't even really know for a fact that shorebirds even have a star compass,'' Dr. Able said.
	Given where the birds studied by Dr. Alerstam are flying, Dr. Able added, ''it certainly makes some sense that these birds would be using the sun compass.''
	Dr. Robert C. Beason, a bird researcher who is chairman of the biology department at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, said that birds were generally thought to use multiple orientation cues, with the ability to reject one or other types of cue if needed. ''They are pretty much opportunistic,'' Dr. Beason said. ''If the magnetic information is unreliable, there's good evidence they don't use it.''
