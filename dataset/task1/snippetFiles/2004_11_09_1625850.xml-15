	The essence of his work involves retrieving deep ice samples, or cores, from glaciers.
	He spends much of his year like a migratory bird, traveling from one glacial mass to another, including the Himalayas and mountains in Peru, Kenya and Alaska.
	''When we go to retrieve a core, it's usually to a place that no one has ever been, and the beauty of ice, which is really different from any other material, is how much you can learn from it,'' he said. ''It tells you the history of precipitation, of dust accumulation and of wind strength. It also gives you a history of the atmosphere, including the presence of sulfates, nitrates and chlorides, which are precisely the factors associated with global warming.''
	In Peru, he said, the Quelccaya ice cap retreated a rate of more than 600 feet a year from 2000 to 2002 -- up from just 15 feet a year in the 1960's and 70's -- leaving a vast 80-foot-deep lake where none had existed when his studies began.
	''When you see the big picture accumulating from many sites, the evidence of drastic climate change becomes quite compelling,'' Dr. Thompson said.
