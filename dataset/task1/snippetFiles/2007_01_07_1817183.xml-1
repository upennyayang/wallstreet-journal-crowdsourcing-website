	Well, fluorescent light's not to like, many people might say.
	What's the problem? For one, it's not incandescent.
	In trying to replace -- depose -- incandescent light bulb light, you're asking people to disengage from a gravitation as primal as the attraction to the sun's light or fire, which are incandescent. Like the bulb and its filament, they make light from heat, to create a glowing focal source, or a ''flame.''
	Fluorescent bulbs activate a gas inside a tube, lighting a fluorescent coating that glows and creates an even, diffuse light without a center. Born in a lab, they don't have much traction on the human experience since the dawn -- incandescent -- of man.
	More important, incandescence operates on the red, or warm, end of the color spectrum. Fluorescence works at the opposite end, with cool blue. Incandescent light burns warmly with radiance, like a flushed, happy face. It smolders, hearth-like, when it's dimmed. Fluorescent light coats surfaces coolly like ash, looks pale when dim. And not all bulbs will dim.
	But fluorescent light's greatest setback in conquering the home might be its own great success with having conquered the workplace and other commercial spheres.
