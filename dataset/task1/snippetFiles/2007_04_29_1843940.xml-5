	In a telephone call yesterday, Novitzky declined to comment on the investigation because it was continuing. Still, the Radomski investigation has turned the spotlight on the steroid problems that have loomed over baseball. Radomski's plea agreement filed Friday in the United States District Court in the Northern District of California included his admission that he had sold anabolic steroids, human growth hormone and amphetamines to dozens of professional baseball players. His guilty plea to felony charges of steroid distribution and money laundering could mean up to 25 years in prison and $500,000 in fines. The Grimsley affidavit, dated May 31, 2006 -- five and a half months after the Radomski affidavit -- stated that Grimsley had used performance-enhancing drugs like human growth hormone, amphetamines and the anabolic steroid named clenbuterol, one of the drugs that Radomski said he had sold once a go-between in baseball had set him up with many of his clients. The affidavit also stated that Grimsley told investigators about former and current players who had used performance-enhancing drugs. There are some similarities between the two affidavits. Both mention virtually the same drugs, both list payments in similar price increments and both have many names of professional baseball players whose names are redacted.
