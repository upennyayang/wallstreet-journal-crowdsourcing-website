	''This is a symbiotic relationship with substantial time depth,'' said Dr. Richard Klein, a Stanford University archaeologist. ''You could imagine dogs would be useful for giving warning signals, or tracking other animals, so you can see how both sides would benefit.''
	If people and dogs have been living together for a long time, ''there would have been some co-evolution of traits that made them function together better,'' Dr. Serpell said. Dogs' ability to pick up on human cues, as shown by Dr. Hare's study, is an example.
	Dr. Hare hopes to visit Novosibirsk and test Dr. Belyaev's tame silver foxes. If the foxes do just as well as dogs in interpreting human behavior, that will suggest that selecting for tameability alone brings about trainability as well, perhaps because calmer dogs are better learners. If the foxes flunk the test, however, that would indicate that trainability must be selected for separately, Dr. Hare said.
	Dogs were probably the first animal to be domesticated and seem to have assumed considerable importance in early human societies. Dr. Darcy Morey, a University of Kansas archaeologist who has studied dog burials all over the world, speaks of the ''incredible compatibility of wolves and men.''
