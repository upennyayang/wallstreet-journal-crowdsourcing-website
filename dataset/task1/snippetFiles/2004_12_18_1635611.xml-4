	It is unclear how many Celebrex cases had already been filed, even before yesterday's announcement. Pfizer puts the number at 24, but Beasley Allen, a law firm in Montgomery, Ala., said it alone has 53 cases filed.
	Plaintiffs' lawyers, who expect the number of cases to swell, quickly cited the cancer study as evidence that Celebrex had many of the same problems as Vioxx and Bextra, another painkiller made by Pfizer. All three are so-called COX-2 drugs. The name refers to their ability to inhibit production of COX-2, an enzyme involved in inflammation.
	''It's not as big as asbestos and it's not as big as tobacco but it's No. 3,'' said Richard G. Sullivan, a Mineola, N.Y., lawyer who represents clients with lawsuits involving the three COX-2 drugs. But many other lawyers said that it was premature to lump Celebrex with the other two COX-2 drugs. Christopher A. Seeger, a New York lawyer who was among the first to sue Merck over Vioxx and also represents Bextra users, said yesterday's announcement was ambiguous.
	''I don't know what to make of it so I'm not filing any lawsuits against them,'' Mr. Seeger said.
