	By several accounts, Edward J. Zander is a man in demand.
	Two years ago, Mr. Zander, the president and chief operating officer of Sun Microsystems, created a division to cater to telecommunications clients -- and four months ago, as the industry fell apart, he collapsed that division into the company's hardware business.
	So he has experience structuring and restructuring the components of a large company, something more and more big businesses need as the economy continues to slow.
	''I'm sure he gets headhunter calls daily,'' Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive, said in a recent interview. ''I'm actually a little jealous.''
	Mr. Zander appears on several companies' wish lists, say executive recruiters, along with David R. Carlucci, general manager of I.B.M.'s operations in the Americas; John R. Joyce, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer; and Dan Warmenhoven, chief executive of Network Appliance Inc.
	These executives have battle scars, and several high-technology companies -- Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks, Sycamore Networks, Redback Networks, Alcatel and Corning Inc. -- have recently looked or are still looking for executives with a record of coping with slumping sales and a hostile stock market, executive search firms say.
