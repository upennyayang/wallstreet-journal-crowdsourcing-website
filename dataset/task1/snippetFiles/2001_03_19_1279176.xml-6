	Ranking or grading employees is also common at technology companies like Cisco Systems and Hewlett-Packard. But recently the concept has been catching on more broadly, according to management consultants. One reason is that as the economy slows, companies often lay off employees. Cisco, for example, announced earlier this month that it would let go as many as 5,000 workers -- and would use grading as one way to identify people to lay off.
	''Companies are playing their version of 'Survivor,' '' said David Thomas, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
	Another reason is that some companies are eager to copy Mr. Welch, long viewed as one of the most successful managers in America.
	Defenders of these systems say anyone who gets a low grade is likely to view the process as unfair. '' 'A' students love grades; 'F' students hate grades,'' said John Sullivan, a human resources professor at San Francisco State University.
	But the techniques, which some employees label with terms like ''rank and yank,'' have come under sharp criticism. While they appear to offer an objective way to judge employees, they can be vulnerable to bias, Mr. Thomas said.
