	The first known record of the term ''base-ball'' in America came in a 1791 ordinance in Pittsfield, Mass., that prohibited ballplaying near the town's new meetinghouse. But this was not the first appearance of that name in print. That distinction belongs to an English children's book of 1744, ''A Little Pretty Pocket-Book.'' Beneath an illustration of three players in a field, a verse described an embryonic version of the game we consider our own:
	The Ball once struck off,
	Away flies the Boy
	To the next destin'd Post,
	And then Home with Joy.
	Substitute ''base'' for ''post,'' and you have something that sounds awfully familiar. By 1796 the rules of this game were well enough established for Johann Gutsmuths, a scholar in Schnepfenthal, Germany, to describe them in a book about popular games and sports. Gutsmuths's ''englische Base-ball'' is clearly recognizable: two teams face off, with a pitcher serving to a batsman who has three shots to put a ball in play before attempting a circuit of bases on his way home. It also predates the rules laid out by the Knickerbockers by nearly 50 years.
