	In recent decades, the debate over religion has been characterized as a struggle between two groups that Noah Feldman calls ''values evangelicals,'' like Roy Moore, who placed the Ten Commandments in the Alabama Supreme Court, and ''legal secularists,'' like Michael Newdow, who attacked the use of ''under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance. This debate does not represent reality.
	The Fourth National Survey of Religion and Politics, completed in 2004 by the University of Akron, shows that only 12.6 percent of Americans consider themselves ''traditionalist evangelical Protestants,'' which the survey equates with the term ''religious right.'' A mere 10.7 percent of Americans define themselves as ''secular'' or ''atheist, agnostic.'' The vast majority of Americans are what survey-takers term centrist or modernist in their religious views.
	These mainstream believers represent to their religiously liberal and conservative neighbors what independents do to Republicans and Democrats in the political arena. They are the under-discussed ''swing voters'' in the values debate who, the survey shows, are slightly pro-choice, believe in the death penalty, support stem-cell research and favor gay rights but oppose gay marriage.
	Above all, they welcome religion in public life but are turned off by efforts to claim exclusive access to God.
