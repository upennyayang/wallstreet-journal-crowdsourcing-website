	Some fashion models with beautifully shaped heads may choose baldness as part of their look. But for most women, loss of hair -- or even thinning of it -- is highly upsetting, often much more so than for men.
	The relatively extensive hair loss that often occurs after pregnancy frightens many a new mother. And women commonly describe hair loss as the most devastating aspect of chemotherapy, even though they know their hair will grow back after the treatments are over.
	But when women start losing their hair for no apparent reason and with no assurance that the loss is reversible, emotional distress can be severe, prompting a desperate search for a solution short of wearing a wig.
	While hair loss in women, as in men, has long been attributed to the effects of ''a bad body chemical called dihydrotestosterone, or DHT,'' as one popular advertisement puts it, dermatologists who study the problem have begun to question the extent of the hormone's role in women who suffer hair loss.
	Their studies suggest that the patterns and other factors involved in women's hair loss often differ from those in men and may warrant different treatments.
