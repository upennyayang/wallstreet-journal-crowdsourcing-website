	Distortions in the image of the artificial star as it returns to Earth are measured continuously and used to deform the telescope's flexible mirror and rapidly correct for atmospheric turbulence. That sharpens images of both the artificial star and the astronomical target. Unclassified pictures of Starfire in action show a pencil-thin laser beam shooting up from its hilltop observatory into the night sky. The Starfire researchers are now investigating how to use guide stars and flexible mirrors in conjunction with powerful lasers that could flash their beams into space to knock out enemy satellites, according to federal officials and Air Force budget documents. ''These are really smart folks who are optimistic about their technology,'' said the senior Pentagon official. ''We want those kind of people on our team.'' But potential weapon applications, he added, if one day approved, ''are out there years and years and years into the future.'' The research centers on Starfire's largest telescope, which Air Force budget documents call a ''weapon-class beam director.'' Its main mirror, 11.5 feet in diameter, can gather in faint starlight or, working in the opposite direction, direct powerful beams of laser light skyward.
