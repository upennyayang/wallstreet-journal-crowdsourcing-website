	Her own family is, of course, environmentally correct. Mr. David drives a Toyota Prius, a so-called hybrid car (which runs on both a gas engine and an electric motor) on ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' the HBO show in which he plays a curmudgeonly comedian with a tolerant wife. The real-life Davids both drive a Prius, too, and live in Los Angeles with their 10- and 12-year-old daughters. She's a model-thin, sparkly 48-year-old, and Mr. David is 10 years older.
	The Davids are well aware that in some quarters Ms. David is caricatured as a celebrity do-gooder. She was infamously labeled a ''Gulfstream liberal'' in a 2004 article in The Atlantic magazine that noted that she chartered private planes even as she pressed for improved fuel-economy standards. An article in The Hollywood Reporter this week said that Ms. David has become ''a symbol to some of showbiz grandstanding at its most self-righteous.''
	Ms. David said she only occasionally uses a private plane and the majority of her air travel is commercial. ''This comes from people trying to marginalize celebrity, trying to marginalize Hollywood,'' she said of the criticism.
