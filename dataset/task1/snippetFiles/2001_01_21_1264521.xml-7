	The collider is the latest and biggest tool of an international group of scientists who are trying to pry open the secrets of the early moments of the universe. When it is running, RHIC smashes together bunches of subatomic particles racing around its 2.4-mile underground tunnel in opposite directions at nearly the speed of light, then sifts through the resulting shower of debris for clues to the stuff of the early universe.
	''We really are going someplace that nobody's been before,'' said Barbara Jacak, an experimental physicist working on one of the detectors that sweeps up the particle debris and painstakingly analyzes it with the help of powerful computers.
	RHIC's allure to young scientists is not only its power, but the chance to get in on a new era of research from the very start. Dr. Drees is an accelerator physicist -- one of those who helped design RHIC and make it work. Her husband, Axel Drees, is also a RHIC physicist and former CERN scientist. Dr. Drees convinced her husband to move to Long Island and work at RHIC three years ago while they were both at CERN.
