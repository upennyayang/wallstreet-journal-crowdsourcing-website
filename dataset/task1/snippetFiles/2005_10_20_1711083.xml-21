	Even seasoned hunters have been betrayed by the thaw, stepping in snow that should be covering ice but instead falling into water. And on Shingle Point, a sandy strip inhabited by Inuvialuit at the tip of the Yukon in Canada, Danny A. Gordon, 70, said it was troubling that fewer icebergs were reaching the bay. It has become windier, too, for reasons people here cannot explain.
	''In the summer 40 years ago, we had lots of icebergs, and you could land your boat on them and climb on them even in summer,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''Now in the winter they are tiny. The weather has changed. Everyone knows it. It's global warming.''
	Sinking Cities
	Vorkuta, a coal-mining city of 130,000, is crumbling.
	Many of the city's homes and factories were built not on hard rock, but on permafrost, a layer of perpetually frozen earth that covers 65 percent of Russia's territory. If the permafrost underneath melts, the ground turns to mush.
	''Everything is falling apart,'' said Lyubov I. Denisova, who lives in a cramped apartment on Lokomotivnaya Street. The ceiling has warped, the walls cracked, the window frames splintered.
