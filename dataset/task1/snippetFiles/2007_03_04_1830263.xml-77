	''The study of evolution is largely the study of trade-offs,'' Wilson wrote in ''Darwin's Cathedral.'' It might seem disadvantageous, in terms of foraging for sustenance and safety, for someone to favor religious over rationalistic explanations that would point to where the food and danger are. But in some circumstances, he wrote, ''a symbolic belief system that departs from factual reality fares better.'' For the individual, it might be more adaptive to have ''highly sophisticated mental modules for acquiring factual knowledge and for building symbolic belief systems'' than to have only one or the other, according to Wilson. For the group, it might be that a mixture of hardheaded realists and symbolically minded visionaries is most adaptive and that ''what seems to be an adversarial relationship'' between theists and atheists within a community is really a division of cognitive labor that ''keeps social groups as a whole on an even keel.''
	Even if Wilson is right that religion enhances group fitness, the question remains: Where does God come in? Why is a religious group any different from groups for which a fitness argument is never even offered -- a group of fraternity brothers, say, or Yankees fans?
