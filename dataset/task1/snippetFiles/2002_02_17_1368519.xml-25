	Craig Leckner, a casting agent and friend of Mr. Governali's who has helped him with his research, says he began as a debunker. Trolling through the paper trail, however, he says he has seen enough to make him think there might be something to the rumors.
	''There's not a treasure hunter in the world who doesn't know about the Hussar,'' he said. ''What's great about Joe is that here's this average guy who has a chance to change history.''
	While Mr. Governali, who is divorced and has no children, has long been a diver, he is hardly the weather-beaten, salt-encrusted Jacques Cousteau character one might expect of a treasure hunter. He looks more suited to play, and indeed is often cast in, one of Hollywood's most enduring roles: a Mafioso.
	''I hate mob parts,'' he said. ''We've got royalty in our family. A Governali sits in Parliament in Italy. My father's cousin, Paul Governali, played for Notre Dame.'' The associations die hard, though. ''We're from Corleone, Sicily,'' he said, pausing for the expected reaction. ''People say: 'Where you from? Corleone? No way.' It's that kind of thing.''
