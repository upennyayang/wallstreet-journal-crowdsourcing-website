	Mr. Hobbs concurred that Mr. Murphy was an outsider, and said that explains the outlandishness of his accusation about cornering the natural gas market in California. ''I think you are dealing with an employee who is not informed,'' he said, ''and that explains why he is no longer with Williams.''
	But Mr. Murphy countered that the company was just not willing to listen to people who questioned the status quo. ''They were so entrenched in their ways, and there was such deep ambivalence,'' he said. ''It went against their egos to surrender the power to take care of these risks.''
	Those risks were alarming, Mr. Murphy said. In September 2000, Mr. Murphy said he noticed that Williams had bet on a fall in interest rates and did not hedge, or set up counterbalancing contracts to neutralize risk, in case they did not drop. Interest rates did fall, and Williams made huge profits. But Mr. Murphy tried, unsuccessfully, to convince Williams that it could not have a position on the direction interest rates would go without mitigating the risk that they might move the opposite way.
	''That they're holding such speculative positions, they should have had to report that to investors,'' he said.
