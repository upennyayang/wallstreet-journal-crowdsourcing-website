	A. It is the sexiest science. What can be more sexy than the creation of the universe? What can be more sexy than black holes and multiple universe dimensions and cosmic streams that are vibrating in a universal symphony? Scientists often refer to interesting problems as being sexy. The more esoteric and the bigger the budget, the sexier, the problem. Unified field theory is very sexy, and nuclear waste, for some reason, is not. In my opinion, it should be.
	Q. What has been the most difficult audience you've encountered?
	A. I played an international group of about a thousand high energy physicists, a very serious lot, indeed. Many of them were from China and Japan and they didn't understand a great deal of English.
	Few got my jokes. What's worse, a whole bunch of them got up in midperformance and left in droves. Happily, a few wild Russians, who didn't speak English either, came dashing up to the stage with flowers from a table arrangement and saved the show.
	Now, astronomers are the best scientific audience I've played for. I think it's because to be an astronomer, you have to have a great capacity for fantasy and wonder.
