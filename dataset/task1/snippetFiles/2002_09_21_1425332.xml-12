	Mr. Summers said on Tuesday that he was making his remarks ''not as president of the university but as a concerned member of our community.''
	But Taha Abdul-Basser, a graduate student in the department of Near Eastern languages and civilization and a member of the Harvard Islamic Society, questioned whether it was possible to separate the statements from the office.
	''I understood his comment that he wished to be understood as an individual speaking, rather than as president, but I doubt that everyone who listened to the speech or read it will be able to make that distinction,'' Mr. Abdul-Basser said. ''And I was saddened to see that evidently support of the divestment campaign was being equated with something as ugly as anti-Semitism. Some of the professors who supported the campaign said they saw a difference between the two, and I certainly do, too.''
	While Mr. Summers strongly rejected divestment, he affirmed the value of open debate and said he was not taking sides.
	''There is much to be debated about the Middle East and much in Israel's foreign and defense policy that can be and should be vigorously challenged,'' he said in his speech.
