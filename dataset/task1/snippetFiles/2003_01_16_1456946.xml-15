	The updates to InstaPundit continue after Mr. Reynolds returns home.
	''When I cook dinner, if there's something I can leave on the stove, I'll post an item and come back,'' he said. ''I haven't burned anything yet.''
	While his daughter plays games on her computer at night, Mr. Reynolds will sit with her, updating InstaPundit on a machine of his own. When she and her mother -- Helen Smith, a forensic psychologist, author and budding documentarian -- go to bed, Mr. Reynolds is back to InstaPundit again.
	''It's gotten to the point where if I go four or five hours without posting, I get e-mails asking where I am,'' he said.
	But it's not just readers' expectations that keep Mr. Reynolds blogging.
