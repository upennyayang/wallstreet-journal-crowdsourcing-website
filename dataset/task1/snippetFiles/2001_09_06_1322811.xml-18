	Astronomers believe that many galaxies harbor black holes at their centers, where gas and dust tend to drain from the starry surroundings. As matter builds up at the center, its gravity compresses it ever more tightly. Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that beyond a certain threshold, the matter collapses to a point of infinite density, forming the black hole.
	Shrouding that point, theoretically at least, is the event horizon. Anything, either matter or light, that brushes the event horizon is sucked inside by gravity.
	But as matter falls through a cosmic maelstrom on its way to the black hole, it should be heated to high temperatures and start radiating detectable energy. The X-rays pouring steadily from the center of the Milky Way, however, are fainter than expected for such a massive black hole.
	That mystery has spawned theories suggesting that the Milky Way is somehow not getting as much matter as expected or that the black hole swallows the matter before it has a chance to radiate very much energy. But according to many of those theories, the radiation should occasionally flare up as isolated lumps of matter fall toward the black hole or storms are generated by strong magnetic fields swirling through space there.
