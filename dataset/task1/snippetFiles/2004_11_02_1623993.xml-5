	With this abundance of hydrocarbons, the sky and surface of Titan would be dangerously flammable, like a petroleum refinery primed to erupt in fire, if there were any free oxygen there.
	So what are scientists of the $3.2 billion Cassini mission to make of such a world?
	''The surface is like a jigsaw puzzle for which the picture is not provided on the box cover,'' said Dr. Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona.
	Dr. Charles Elachi, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here, where the Cassini mission is controlled, likened the problem of understanding Titan to reading a mystery novel. ''Each time you flip the page you learn something new,'' he said, ''but you don't know the whole story until you've read the whole book.''
	Some early interpretations of the Titanian surface lean heavily on what was already known from ground-based and previous spacecraft observations about the moon's nitrogen-methane atmosphere, or from comparisons with findings of other icy moons, notably Jupiter's Ganymede.
	Dr. Soderblom said it made ''a minute amount of sense'' that, given the composition of Titan's atmosphere, the fluids that might have shaped some of the landscape were mixtures of methane and ethane.
