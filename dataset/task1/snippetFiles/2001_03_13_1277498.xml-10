	A. It's a meeting ground for scientists from all over the world. The Web site is a place where they can place a research paper after it's been accepted for publication. But instead of waiting six months for it to appear in print, they can share information right away, unless the journal in question objects, which most do not. It's also a place where families can get help. My dad died from a dementia at age 80, so I can relate to what people are going through. When families get a diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, they don't understand what it means. They get it mixed up with the new variant of the disease in England that is related to mad cow disease. So they come to me really confused. Their needs are not being met by health professionals. I put them in touch with support groups on the Web, and that can help a lot. Q. Where do you get your information for the mad cow Web site? A. Many scientists are more than happy to share information with me. Some information gets leaked to me.
