	Reacting to the news in Miami, the Cuban American National Foundation issued a statement today saying that most of the measures to be announced are consistent with current policy and praised the Administration for refusing to re-evaluate American policy toward Cuba.
	The most important proposal is to increase the flow of dollars to Cuba, officials said. Today these remittances are limited to $1,200 a year from a Cuban-American family to relatives in Cuba. The amount could increase sharply under the plan proposed by Ms. Albright: any American citizen could send $1,200 a year to anyone in Cuba except to senior Communist officials. Religious groups, human rights groups and other organizations may be able to send larger sums to sister organizations under proposals still in the works, officials said.
	The most politically appealing of the proposals was for holding two exhibition games between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban national team. Baseball is immensely popular in Cuba, a wellspring of baseball talent. However, a baseball official said tonight that fears of angering anti-Castro Cuban-Americans could delay or scuttle a trip to Havana planned for this week by members of the Orioles organization.
