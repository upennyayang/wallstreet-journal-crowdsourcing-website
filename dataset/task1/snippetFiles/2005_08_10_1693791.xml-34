	Mark L. Polansky, an astronaut who has been assigned to command the Discovery on a mission next year, said the latest mission made him ''very happy,'' but he added: ''We know we have a lot of things we need to look at. We know we have work in front of us that we must do.''
	For the crew of the Discovery, the seven members of the Columbia crew and their fate were never far from mind.
	Colonel Kelley, the pilot, acknowledged feeling ''a moment of trepidation'' when Colonel Collins started the engines to take the craft out of orbit and into the punishing heat of re-entering the atmosphere at 25 times the speed of sound.
	During the descent, he said, he watched some of the onboard displays more than others to see whether the Discovery was showing any of the warning signs that the Columbia did two and a half years ago before it broke up and killed its seven-member crew.
	Was the nose of the craft yawing to one side? Were the steering jets using more propellant than they should, as if fighting an inexorable force?
	''I was watching through the period when Columbia broke apart,'' Colonel Kelley said.
