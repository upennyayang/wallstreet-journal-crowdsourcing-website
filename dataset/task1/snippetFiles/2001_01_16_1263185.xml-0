	As any long-haul airline pilot knows, the shortest distance between two points on earth is not along a constant compass heading, but rather along what in spherical geometry is called a great circle. So to conserve fuel and save time, a pilot usually flies a great circle route, relying on a compass or some higher technology like radio beacons or satellites to make the frequent directional changes required.
	Researchers in Sweden and Iceland have now discovered that certain Arctic shorebirds accomplish this navigational feat as well, flying what amount to great circle routes on their annual summer migrations across the Canadian Arctic on their way to South America. But there is nothing high-tech about it, the researchers say, as the birds apparently rely only on a solar compass, using the position of the sun and their innate sense of time to guide them.
	Thomas Alerstam, a professor of animal ecology at Lund University in Sweden, and the other researchers tracked migrating flocks of plovers and sandpipers across the Arctic, using radar aboard an icebreaker traveling the Northwest Passage. Using the altitude, direction and speed data obtained, the researchers were able to extrapolate the birds' migratory paths.
