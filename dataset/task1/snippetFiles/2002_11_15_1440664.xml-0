	For the young Albert Einstein, a 26-year-old patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, 1905 was a very good year. After years of turmoil and tension he was living a middle-class life with his wife, Mileva, and a year-old son, Hans Albert. He was completing his Ph.D., and he published a spate of scientific papers that changed history. Among them was the theory of relativity, which gave the world E=mc2, clocks that speed up and slow down and too many bad jokes using the word ''relative.''
	Although he would not give up his day job for another four years, the young man with the dark eyes and curly hair was on his way to scientific fame and worldwide celebrity. And what a long, strange trip it was! In the 76 years from his birth in 1879 in Ulm, Germany, to his death in 1955 in Princeton, N.J., he went from rebellious prodigal youth to the bad-boy scientist in Bern, cosmic guru, peacenik, atomic prophet, Jewish hero, civil rights crusader and target of J. Edgar Hoover. He vaulted from scientific revolutionary to the embodiment of the 20th century itself with all its bright hopes and failures.
