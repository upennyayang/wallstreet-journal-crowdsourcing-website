	''I think there's a distinction between what you do to yourself and what you do to the larger environment,'' Dr. Silver said. Society looks askance at any attempt to change human evolution or tweak human nature in a way that will be passed on to posterity. But if you could engineer only yourself, there would be few limits.
	The technical problems are serious because this is different from using genetic engineering to create new strains of mice and other creatures. To create these strains of mice, scientists start at the beginning, with an egg cell. The difficulty comes in sending genes into the body once it is fully grown to try to get the body's cells to express them. Dr. Silver said this had been tried for medical uses but with little success. ''Somatic cell gene therapy is extremely inefficient,'' he said. It's hard to get the cells to take up genes and express them. Researchers have, however, succeeded in getting mice to take up and express luminescent genes in lung cells.
	That's a beginning.
	Athletes, who seem willing to indulge in self-experiment with relatively little concern for their long-term health, would push biotech in another direction.
