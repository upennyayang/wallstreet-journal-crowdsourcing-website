	The 360-acre agricultural laboratory in Weybridge, England, that is testing a specimen from a Washington cow for mad cow disease has had plenty of experience.
	In November 1986, researchers at the lab identified the first case of mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Since then, mad cow has hit Britain harder than any other country, and the lab, along with Britain's Veterinary Laboratories Agency, has been one of the world's main sources for information about the disease.
	More than 180,000 cases of mad cow have been diagnosed here, about 90 percent of the world's total. The country's beef industry, which also suffered a 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth disease, has taken years to recover.
	A fierce battle against mad cow disease began in earnest in 1996, when the British government said there could be a link between the disease and a similar human condition called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In August 1996, a British coroner ruled that a 20-year-old British vegetarian, who died from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, caught it from eating beefburgers as a child, starting a nationwide panic. Overall, about 120 people in Britain have died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and a dozen more are infected with the disease.
