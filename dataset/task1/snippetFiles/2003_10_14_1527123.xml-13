	That approach used to be common, but now it bucks the intellectual tide, said Dr. Marc D. Hauser, a psychologist at Harvard who has made use of Dr. Ryan's ideas.
	''We're living in this age of narrowing and reductionism,'' he said, ''and Mike is one of the few who has kept true to the idea that there are many different questions you can ask about animal behavior.''
	Son of a truck driver and a secretary, Michael Ryan grew up in Northern New Jersey and went to college thinking he would teach high school. But the pleasures of research caught him, through a master's (Rutgers), Ph.D. (Cornell), postdoctorate (Berkeley) and his post here, where he has taught for 20 years. With his fieldwork tan and his reedy, cheerful voice, Dr. Ryan, 49, is the model of a happy researcher. He has been thinking about biology since a high school teacher, a Benedictine monk, got him excited about science.
	Dr. Ryan enjoys every facet of a biologist's life -- from abstract theorizing to a jungle night recording amphibian sex acts. One fish study began after he noticed unusual-looking males as he snorkeled a Mexican river.
