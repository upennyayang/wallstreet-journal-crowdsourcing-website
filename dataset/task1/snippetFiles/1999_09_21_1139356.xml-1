	In human courtship, some males say it with flowers. Plethodon jordani, a type of terrestrial salamander, is more direct, if less romantic: when a male pitches woo, it places a chemical compound from a gland under its chin directly on a female's nostrils.
	That compound belongs to a class called pheromones, which help one creature identify others of the same species, their sex and whether they are ready to mate (in short, they are nature's love potions). While the effects of pheromones on behavior have been widely studied, few of the compounds in vertebrates have been identified.
	A research team led by a scientist at the University of Chicago has now identified the main component of the salamander pheromone. The researchers, whose work was reported in the journal Science, also showed that this component, a protein, directly affects how receptive the female is.
	Males use the pheromone during a phase of courtship, ''tail-straddling walk,'' in which the happy couple strolls, not arm in arm, but with the female straddling the male from behind. Using males whose chin glands had been removed, researchers tested the effect of the protein during the walk by placing it on the females' nostrils.
