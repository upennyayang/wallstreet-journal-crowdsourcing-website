	After the utilities crumbled, the company did manage to get back a big part of the money. But in a presentation Mr. Murphy made for the company on Oct. 8, 2001, the total owed to Williams by California utilities was $812 million. The company said on Friday that to date, California utilities owed it $217 million, and that it expects to be paid in full.
	In an e-mail message on Nov. 29 to Stephanie Cipolla, the head of human resources at the energy marketing and trading unit, Mr. Murphy wrote: ''We're getting up to over a year now, and this money has cost us something like 50 million interest costs on funding the 800 million hole in our balance sheet. I would have hedged that risk for much less than a 50 million bonus, honest.''
	The company faced the same choices a year later, in the fall of 2001, when Enron began to falter. But the California debacle seemed to have taught Williams nothing, Mr. Murphy said in an interview and in e-mail messages to colleagues.
	Mr. Murphy said he pointed out to his superiors that Enron's creditworthiness was eroding.
