	Mr. Johnson, who found himself to be better at language than visual processing, said his wife used to get annoyed when he couldn't recall details about a house they were planning to renovate. Now, he says, they understand that she is better at visual tasks, and he tries harder to compensate.
	Many of those who advocate greater tolerance for brain quirks caution that it should not serve as an excuse for individuals to behave inappropriately. ''It's not a get-out-of-jail-free card,'' Dr. Ratey said. ''It's an awareness of what you need to do or accept about yourself and then decide, 'Do I want to fit in more or not?'''
	The answer, increasingly, may be ''not.'' Many A.D.D. adults say their condition contributes to their creativity, and some with Asperger's are now critiquing those they call ''neurotypicals.''
	On Internet sites like the Institute for the Study of the Neurologically Typical (www. isnt.autistics.org), autistics satirize the cultural fascination with deviance. ''Neurotypical individuals,'' states the Web site, ''find it difficult to be alone'' and ''are often intolerant of seemingly minor differences in others.''
