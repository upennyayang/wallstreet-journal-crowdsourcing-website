	Hunter's underweight scruples were utterly necessary to his prodigious achievements as a surgeon and a biologist. As with the eminent body-snatching anatomists Leonardo and Vesalius, a sentimentality about the dignity of the corpse would have precluded any and all discoveries, and medical knowledge would have remained in the dark for several centuries. Likewise, a refusal to carry out casual experimentation on his patients would have kept Hunter from mak-ing the tremendous medical strides that he made. Before he arrived on the scene, the healing arts had dead-ended at the theories of Hippocrates. These held that disease was the result of an imbalance of ''humors'' and could be remedied by reducing the unwanted surpluses: by blood-letting, enemas and purgatives, all virtually useless and occasionally fatal. Moore, a journalist and first-time author, doesn't condone body snatching or vivisection, but she understands why they were done -- because there were no alternatives.
	Hunter is a rarity among biographers' subjects, in that his infamy -- diverting as it is -- is far less compelling than his fame and his straight-ahead accomplishments. And Moore's tireless devotion to detail brings the man and his maverick career vividly, compellingly, gruesomely to life.
