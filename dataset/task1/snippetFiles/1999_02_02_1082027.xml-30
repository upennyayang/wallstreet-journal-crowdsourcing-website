	Wild-2 now travels in a looping path from just outside Jupiter's orbit to just inside that of Mars, where it makes its closest approach to the Sun and reaches peak activity.
	The spacecraft, 97 days after that peak, is to zoom past the comet. The rendezvous site lies beyond the red planet. Still, the Sun will be able to coax the ice ball into shedding dense swarms of particles and vapors.
	At 13,600 miles per hour, the spacecraft is to swoop through the comet's coma, the globular cloudlike mass that makes up the head, passing within 100 or so miles of the core. It will capture dust and photograph the nucleus. Particles will hit the dust catcher at up to six times the speed of a bullet fired from a high-powered rifle, NASA estimates.
	The craft's front end and solar panels are shielded with armor plates to protect Stardust from the storm of icy particles.
	Scientists say the particles will range from roughly 100 microns (twice the width of a typical human hair) to less than a micron (one-fiftieth of a human hair).
