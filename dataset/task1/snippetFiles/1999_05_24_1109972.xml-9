	Bertelsmann's plan to take more companies public in the coming months is part of a broader corporate trend, according to David R. Brodwin, an associate partner at Andersen Consulting, a management and technology consulting firm.
	''They're in the first wave, one of the pioneers,'' Mr. Brodwin said. ''All the major media companies are wrestling with how to compete with the Internet and how to compete with start-ups. Most of these companies are public and they simply can't afford to spend the kind of money that the competition is able to spend based on their initial public offerings. They can't afford to do the kinds of deals that they can for stock.''
	Such ''spin-outs,'' as Mr. Brodwin called them, can present potential problems in large companies. One is that managers in the parent corporation's core companies may resent the stock options that managers in newly public companies receive. Another is that it could heighten tensions and divisions between rival divisions of a far-flung organization.
	But Mr. Middelhoff seems ready to take that risk with companies like Springer-Verlag, in which Bertelsmann acquired a majority stake last year for $597 million.
