	Relativity theory came in two parts. The first, in 1905, now called special relativity, said that the laws of physics did not depend on how fast you were moving. Among other things, that meant that in order for the speed of a light beam to come out the same for everyone, clocks would have to appear to speed up or slow down depending on their relative motions.
	How this slippery behavior could come to be is illustrated with an ingenuity and simplicity worthy of Einstein himself in an exhibit featuring something called a light clock. And the 10 minutes or so spent taking it in will be amply repaid.
	The light clock is just a pair of mirrors with a pulse of light bouncing between them; each bounce is a tick of the clock. Comparing this situation to somebody dribbling a basketball, the exhibit shows that if the mirrors are moving, the light will have to travel farther, on a diagonal, between each bounce. As a result the ''ticks'' will happen farther apart. Time will appear to slow.
	That simple thought is almost all you need to know about relativity.
