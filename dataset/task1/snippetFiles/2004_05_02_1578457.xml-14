	When he started practicing in 1978, Dr. Tepper was one of the first animal doctors with a specialty in avian medicine. His training was at the University of Li√®ge in Belgium, where pigeon racing is a local tradition. It made doctoring birds a natural. Six years ago, after requests from several clients who didn't know where to turn for help with their fish, he enrolled in post-professional courses at the University of Georgia.
	''I had always been a fish hobbyist and I never thought about putting the two together until the koi craze really started taking off,'' Dr. Tepper said. ''That's fueled this new interest in pet-fish medicine.''
	While he handles frantic calls from goldfish owners, most of Dr. Tepper's fish patients are koi.
	''They make eye contact,'' Dr. Tepper said. ''It's not your tank of guppies. This is like a dog or a cat. They all have individual personalities.''
	Recently, Dr. Tepper switched his fish practice to preventative care. He visits clients in the pond-wellness program in the spring and fall.
	''It's a disservice to have someone bring you a fish and just a water sample and try to make a diagnosis based on that,'' Dr. Tepper said.
