	The Korea story, pieced together over more than a year by three Associated Press reporters on two continents, went up like a rocket. It drew on the accounts of the survivors of the massacre at No Gun Ri and the soldiers who participated, all of whom were quoted by name. Newspapers in major markets, including The New York Times, played it prominently, as did the networks' evening news programs, along with CNN, Fox News and National Public Radio. Time and Newsweek each did a report. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen ordered an investigation.
	Not half bad. For about four days, news organizations followed the Pentagon's reaction and published reports about the A.P. account. But after the first accounts and editorials, there was little to add. The editorial murmurs of regret faded away, with the exception of Wednesday's searing responses from James Webb, a combat Marine in Vietnam and a former Navy Secretary, who offered a sympathetic view of the soldiers in an essay in The Wall Street Journal.
	Compare the arc of the No Gun Ri coverage with that of the Playboy interview. Brief news accounts about the wrestler-turned-Governor's brash remarks appeared on Thursday, Sept. 30, but generally played inside newspapers.
