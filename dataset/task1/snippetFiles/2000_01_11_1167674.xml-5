	But unlike humans (and any other adult vertebrates, as far as is known), the iguanas can lengthen once again when food availability improves and can switch between long and short repeatedly during their lifetimes. Danger From Algae Algae of a different sort played a much more draconian role among the sea life off California's central coast, according to researchers from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and other institutions. They have connected the deaths of more than 400 sea lions in 1998 to an algal bloom that produced a powerful neurotoxin. Mussels are often monitored during blooms for signs that the algae may be producing compounds that can be harmful to marine life or even humans. At the time of the 1998 bloom, however, no evidence of the neurotoxin, domoic acid, was found in blue mussels from Monterey Bay. By contrast, high levels of the acid were found in bay anchovies. And, scientists report, high levels were also found in the urine and feces of surviving sea lions. The survivors exhibited many symptoms of neurological damage, including seizures, head weaving and abnormal scratching. So it was not surprising, perhaps, that domoic acid produced by the algae was found to be the cause.
