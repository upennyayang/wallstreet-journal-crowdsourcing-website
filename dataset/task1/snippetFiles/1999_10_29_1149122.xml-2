	The three most ancient groups are water lilies, relatives of the spice star anise and the oldest of all, a group now represented only by Amborella, an unremarkable bush found only on the South Pacific island of New Caledonia.
	Identification of the groups and the drawing of new family trees will allow botanists to follow with new precision the evolution of many important characteristics of flowering plants, from their defining trait, the flower, to their most delicious, the fruit.
	The four teams, involving scientists from many universities in several countries, came to identical conclusions, though the results of only one team, comprising scientists from Harvard, have been published so far. Between them, the teams include most leading researchers using plant DNA comparisons to understand the early history of plants.
	''It is the answer,'' Dr. James Doyle, a paleobotanist at the University of California at Davis, said of the identification of the three groups and their arrangement on the new family tree of plants. Dr. Doyle was not involved with the studies but, like others, he expressed confidence in the results.
	''It's all come to a huge crescendo,'' he said.
