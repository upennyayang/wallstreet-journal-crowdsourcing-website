	Mr. Governali regretted that he could not show me the map. Here one enters into the competitive, suspicious world of underwater salvage, which is as much about plowing through dusty archives as about sonar and scuba.
	After several diving attempts on the Hussar in the last few years, he has retrieved several artifacts. He showed me several stills from underwater footage, which admittedly were rather Rorschactian.
	''It's very hard to see,'' he said, ''but this is part of the ballast, this was an iron nail we found, and this is a 10-pint pitcher.'' Determining ownership of a wreck involves navigating a jurisdictional and legal maze, but Mr. Governali was sufficiently convinced to file a claim in Admiralty Court for possession of the wreck.
	James Sinclair, a marine archaeologist from St. Augustine, Fla., who has worked on the Titanic, among other projects, began advising Mr. Governali after Mr. Governali sent him some artifacts, including the pitcher.
	''Pottery's one of the best tools for dating a site,'' Mr. Sinclair said. ''A piece from ancient Egypt is probably in just about as good a shape as a piece from yesterday.
	Elsewhere, the pitcher might prove he had found the Hussar.
