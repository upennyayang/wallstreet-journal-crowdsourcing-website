	There is even evidence that people have ''grandmother neurons'' -- single cells that recognize a unique face. In once recent paper, Dr. Itzhak Fried, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Dr. Christof Koch, a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology, reported that a single cell in the hippocampus of a patient being prepared for epilepsy surgery fired vigorously and consistently in response to a picture of the actress Jennifer Aniston, but far less so when the patient looked at other photographs.
	Understanding that the shiver of celebrity recognition, or the whole-body ache of longing, leaves a physical trace in the brain seems to give people more sympathy for others' emotions and reactions, say neuroscientists who have presented findings in front of professional and lay audiences.
	''Suppose you know someone who's having trouble, who's suffering from bipolar disorder or depression, and nothing has helped, no therapy, nothing,'' said Dr. Brian Wandell, a psychologist at Stanford University who studies the visual cortex. ''It's nice to know from this new science that there may be some other way to alter the system'' than treating it like a character flaw.
