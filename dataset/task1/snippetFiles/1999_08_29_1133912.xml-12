	Birds are key, explained Robert A. Askins, professor of zoology at Connecticut College in New London. ''Birds in general are a very good indicator of what's going on in an ecosystem,'' he said, noting that it was a decline in fish-eating birds that revealed the widespread effects of DDT. Marsh birds, he added, have been under-represented in other surveys, because their habitat isn't easily accessible.
	Jenny Dickson, a wildlife biologist with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, called the current Audubon survey ''more important than it looks on the surface,'' because it covers not only birds, but the health of the habitat. ''It gives us a whole block of information; it helps us to improve our management.''
	The regional aspect of the survey will enable states to work together better, she said, and she welcomes the plan to organize volunteers to carry out long-term monitoring that her department -- like others elsewhere -- simply couldn't afford.
	Mr. Shriver also noted that it's necessary to have baseline information on hand if an environmental disaster occurs. New England's coastal marshes, he said, are ''in a direct line'' for oil spills.
