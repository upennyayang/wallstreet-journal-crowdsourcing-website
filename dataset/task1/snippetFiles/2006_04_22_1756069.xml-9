	''And by the way, you know, global warming is good for one thing: bugs and pollen,'' Ms. David said, tucking into her salad.
	''I do not want to be talking to the converted,'' she said of the film. ''We want to talk to people who say: 'O.K., wait a second. What the heck is this and why should I care? And you know, hey, when my kids come home, we're going to all watch it tonight.' ''
	Her own family is, of course, environmentally correct. Mr. David drives a Toyota Prius, a so-called hybrid car (which runs on both a gas engine and an electric motor) on ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' the HBO show in which he plays a curmudgeonly comedian with a tolerant wife. The real-life Davids both drive a Prius, too, and live in Los Angeles with their 10- and 12-year-old daughters. She's a model-thin, sparkly 48-year-old, and Mr. David is 10 years older.
	The Davids are well aware that in some quarters Ms. David is caricatured as a celebrity do-gooder.
	Ms. David said she only occasionally uses a private plane and the majority of her air travel is commercial.
