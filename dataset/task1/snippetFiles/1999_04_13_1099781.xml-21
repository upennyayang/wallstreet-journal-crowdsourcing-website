	One woman, he said, claimed the smell went away when her nose was irritated. ''She bent a paper clip and stuck it up her nose,'' he said.
	Kain Blandford, one of Dr. Leopold's patients, was 18 years old and working as a waitress when she was struck by what she calls ''The Taste.'' She ordered a hamburger and fries at McDonald's, took a bite of her lunch, and found that it tasted ''really bad,'' as if something was rotten. A month later, the rotten taste returned. When it started happening every few weeks, she said, ''I realized that this is me, that this is not the food.''
	Ms. Blandford began to keep track of the things that brought the rotten sensation on: steam, grease, humidity, heavy perfume.
	For a while she thought crying caused it to go away, and she would think about the saddest things she could imagine in order to make herself cry. Then she thought it got better when she pinched her nostrils. ''I started holding my nose all the time,'' she said. ''I didn't want to tell people about it because it's so embarrassing and so strange.''
