	Senator John McCain of Arizona, who led hearings into steroid use in 2004, repeated his calls for the players union to agree to effective drug testing during a campaign stop yesterday in Tempe, Ariz. He said that the players union and its executive director, Donald Fehr, had ''basically stymied progress on this issue to a significant degree, including a lack of cooperation with Senator Mitchell.''
	''I hope they'll cooperate, and eliminate once and for all,'' he said.
	Of the most recent developments, McCain said, ''You'll probably see more Congressional hearings, if the initial stories are true.''
	Dr. Gary I. Wadler, an associate professor of medicine at New York University and a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency, said that the Radomski case could hasten another big change in the way doping cases and drug-testing are handled. He said that baseball is on the cusp of realizing it is overwhelmed by the steroids problem and that it cannot handle it on its own.
	''I do think we are moving more and more in the direction that we'll wind up with federal legislation,'' he said. ''People can't lose sight that it's drug-dealing.
