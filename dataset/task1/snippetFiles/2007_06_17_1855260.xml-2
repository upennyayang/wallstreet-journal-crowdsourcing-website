	Dr. Remington, a professor at Yale University for more than four decades, co-founded the field's scientific organization, the Lepidopterists' Society, while still a graduate student. Later, as a professor, he shaped the field by recruiting and serving as a mentor to several generations of the discipline's leading scientists. Dr. Remington also helped the discipline grow outside the walls of the academy, working with serious amateur collectors, most famously with Vladimir Nabokov.
	''When you wanted to know anything about butterflies, you went to him,'' said Naomi Pierce, Hessel professor of biology at Harvard University and former student of Dr. Remington's. ''It's just incredible if you think about the list of people who were his students or worked with him.''
	Dr. Remington was born in Reedville, Va., in 1922, to Maud and P. Sheldon Remington, a school headmaster. Charles spent his boyhood chasing butterflies alongside his father, also a collector. He studied biology at Principia College and then parlayed his World War II military service into a bug-finding mission, serving as a medical entomologist in the Pacific.
	During his graduate studies at Harvard, he founded the Lepidopterists' Society with an equally butterfly-smitten undergraduate, Harry Clench.
