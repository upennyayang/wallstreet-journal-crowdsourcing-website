	The tough work would begin early Monday when the first team of spacewalkers, Dr. John M. Grunsfeld and Dr. Richard M. Linnehan, are to emerge from the shuttle for six and a half hours; three such work periods are scheduled for the pair. The astronauts are to replace Hubble's two solar power arrays with smaller, more durable ones.
	The other team, Dr. James H. Newman and Dr. Michael J. Massimino, are to go out the next day to finish the solar panel job and replace one of the telescope's four reaction wheel assemblies, devices containing spinning flywheels that point Hubble from one target to another.
	Other Hubble renovations include the installation of a new cooling system on an infrared instrument that has been inoperable since 1999 because of a coolant leak, and replacement of the main power switching controller, which has been degrading after almost 12 years in space.
	Replacing the power unit, which was not designed to be replaced, is considered the toughest and riskiest job. The astronauts must disconnect 36 tightly placed circuit units and later redo the connections when a new 160-pound unit is put in.
