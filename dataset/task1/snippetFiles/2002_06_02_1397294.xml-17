	E-mail messages sent months before Mr. Murphy was dismissed show that he and other Williams employees repeatedly and urgently warned Williams executives that the company had to reduce its trading risks, especially with shaky counterparties like Enron.
	But those warnings were apparently ignored, Mr. Murphy and others said. Blinkered by arrogance and an ignorance of the financial sophistication required to trade electricity, critics say, Williams executives thought the company and the deregulated power sector would thrive uninterrupted. Reducing risks, or hedging, takes away from the bottom line, the critics added.
	''Not hedging properly is the same thing as inflating profits,'' said James Chanos, president of Kynikos Associates, a New York short seller, ''because hedging has a cost.'' His company has sold Williams stock short, anticipating further declines.
	The latest wave of investor concern and regulatory scrutiny roiling the power industry arises from questions about the ethics and profitability of electricity trading. Enron released memos a few weeks ago detailing methods that its traders used to manipulate electricity prices in California in 2000. Other energy companies have acknowledged that they tried similar tactics, while some -- including Dynegy, CMS Energy and Reliant Resources -- have said that they had made questionable power trades that inflated revenue.
