	In Wichita, the conservative incumbent, Mary Douglass Brown, said the new standards ''put a little crack in the foundation'' of evolution scientists, ''their money, their books, their schools.''
	''There's a lot of money in evolution,'' Mrs. Brown, a former teacher, said. ''To me, it's pseudoscience.''
	Mrs. Brown said the board left in references to ''micro-evolution,'' changes within organisms that ''people can see,'' like bacteria becoming disease-resistant.
	''I don't believe that humans descended from apes, no,'' she said. ''How come there's still apes running around loose and there are humans? Why did some of them decide to evolve and some did not?''
	Such ideas propelled people like Bill Skaer, a veterinarian, and Burt Humburg, a medical student, to switch to the Republican Party to vote against Mrs. Brown.
	And they spurred Carol Rupe, a former Wichita school board member, to challenge her.
	Ms. Rupe said she was ''embarrassed when suddenly, after the vote last summer, we were called by our friends and relatives in other states wondering what kind of state we lived in.''
	''We said it was just a few people,'' she said. ''But, my goodness, if those few are re-elected, then it reflects on the entire state.''
