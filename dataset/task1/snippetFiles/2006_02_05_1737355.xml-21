	A native of Pretoria, South Africa, Mr. Musk moved by himself at age 17 to Canada, where he briefly attended Queens University in Kingston, Ontario. He later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received two undergraduate degrees -- one in theoretical physics and the other in business from the Wharton School. He enrolled in the graduate physics program at Stanford in 1995 but dropped out within days to become an Internet entrepreneur.
	His first big hit was Zip2, a Web-based ad company that he sold in 1999 for $307 million. (The New York Times Company was an investor in Zip2.) He moved on to another Web venture, involving electronic payments over the Internet -- even though, as skeptics noted, he lacked experience in banking. That business ultimately became PayPal, which eBay bought for $1.5 billion in 2002.
	By the time Mr. Musk was 30, he had amassed $300 million and was pondering his future.
	His first thoughts were of philanthropy -- and of space. He came up with the idea of ''Mars Oasis,'' an effort to send a small greenhouse to Mars to gather scientific information and create excitement about space travel -- or so Mr. Musk thought.
