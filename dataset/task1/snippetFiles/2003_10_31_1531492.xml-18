	Mailman is ''doing cutting-edge stuff that's new for them, and it's great to have this resource in the city to call on when things hit,'' said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, New York City's health commissioner. In an enterovirus outbreak this month on Staten Island, Dr. Frieden said, the Greene lab volunteered to help the city -- which has its own B.S.L. 3 lab -- try to identify the microbe. Such work is not the traditional role of schools of public health. With some notable exceptions, they have tended to focus on long-term health threats, data analysis and shoe-leather epidemiology, leaving the response to outbreaks and sophisticated microbiology to government agencies, medical schools and hospitals. But Dr. Lipkin said the lines between the two roles have been blurred, as scientists learn of links between germs and chronic diseases like schizophrenia or diabetes, as they find that formerly harmless germs can suddenly become virulent, and as a more crowded, connected world makes it easier for diseases to jump species to species and continent to continent. ''Anything that we learn about outbreaks of acute disease is going to help us in chronic diseases, as well,'' he said.
