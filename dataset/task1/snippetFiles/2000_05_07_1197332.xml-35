	Bloom: No, I agree that it's a defense that leaks all over the place, which is why you see people with money in treatment. Q: A number of you have started doing couples therapy, as opposed to classic one-on-one analysis. Is that part of a general profession-wide outreach? Or does it reflect some other trend? Kramer: I think it's not a coincidence. I turned to couples therapy as a more important part of my practice partly because of the notion that there are some people who really do have different and more complete selves in a relationship than they have in isolation. I think the issue of the fragility of the couple has become extremely important and shows itself in all sorts of areas even when divorce is not an issue. In terms of the balance of power within marriage, in terms of aspirations of young women, it just seems to me that some constant awareness of the fragility of marriage permeates all sorts of aspects of therapy. Bloom: Actually, two changes that I have observed are that I certainly see far more same-sex couples than I used to whose concerns are not either cultural homophobia or internalized homophobia.
