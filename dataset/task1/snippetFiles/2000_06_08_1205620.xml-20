	Although the service hasn't opened yet, its operations are expected to be somewhat like SETI@Home's. After a participant installs the ProcessTree program to a home computer, that user will connect to the Internet to download a work unit, or batch of data, from one of the company's servers. Once the work unit is on the home computer, the ProcessTree software will munch and crunch the information during the PC's idle time. Then it will send data back to the ProcessTree server and collect a new unit. In return for those spare processor cycles, the company will mail the user a check or credit the user's online account with small payments that can be spent online like electronic cash. Armin Lenz, a software developer at Distributed Science, said that more than 25,000 people had signed up to work on the venture. He predicted that distributed computing would become an industry unto itself. ''I think it is going to be huge,'' Mr. Lenz said in an e-mail message. ''Think in terms of going from 'railroads' of supercomputing to the 'individual mass traffic' of distributed processing.
