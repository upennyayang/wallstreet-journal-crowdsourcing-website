	''I like Eli Manning,'' the NBC football analyst John Madden said in a conference call Thursday. ''I think he is the real deal and he's going to be a top quarterback.
	''He's not going to be Peyton Manning, but I think he's going to be a top quarterback. Right now, it looks like his confidence level isn't up, he's not reading and getting the ball out of there quickly, his decisions aren't really sharp.''
	Then, with a nod toward today's game, Madden added, '' I think right now he needs Tiki Barber.''
	He will not have Barber next season, because Barber, one of the league's best running backs, is retiring. And it is unclear who his coaches will be. Coughlin fired Hufnagel on Christmas and handed the duties to Gilbride.
	Those three coaches were given the responsibility for Manning's development in 2004, and a large part of the decision over who coaches him next season will hinge on how the team's owners view Manning's progress and potential.
	Manning said he felt somewhat responsible for Hufnagel's dismissal. But he mostly seems unfazed by the speculation that swirls around him.
