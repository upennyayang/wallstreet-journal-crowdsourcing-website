	Elric McHenry, the shuttle program development manager, said Congress and the Clinton Administration would soon decide what to do about a replacement for the shuttle. But whatever the decision, he said, the shuttle fleet would continue to fly for at least a decade, and probably longer, because there are no alternatives on the immediate horizon.
	''It's prudent for the shuttle program to assume that for the next 10 years, we will be it,'' Mr. McHenry said at a news briefing, ''and I personally believe we will fly much longer than that.''
	Other space experts agree. Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University in Washington, said that the only shuttle alternatives that existed were on paper and that he believed the current spacecraft would continue flying for 15 to 20 years. ''The shuttle is the only re-usable, manned spacecraft that we've got,'' he said.
	John E. Pike, space policy expert for the Federation of American Scientists, said the shuttle could be the spacecraft equivalent of the much-modified B-52 bomber, which the Air Force recently said could remain in service more than 70 years after its introduction.
