	''I'm not saying it was easy for women,'' said Dr. Rachel Ivie, a sociologist and an author of the report. But she said her statistics showed no indication of discrimination in the hiring of female physicists -- supporting one of Dr. Summers's points -- or women dropping out of the field at a higher rate than men, countering what Dr. Summers had offered as the most important reason there are fewer women in science and engineering. Dr. Summers had asked, ''What fraction of young women in their mid-20's make a decision that they don't want to have a job that they think about 80 hours a week?'' and answered his own question: ''That has got to be a large part of what is observed.'' Dr. Ivie said the main reason fewer women made it to the top in physics was simply that fewer started at the bottom. At each job level, she said, the fraction of women matched what would be expected for women advancing at the same rate as men. Instead, the sex disparity arises earlier in the pipeline, between high school and college. ''That's where the drop-off point in physics is,'' Dr. Ivie said.
