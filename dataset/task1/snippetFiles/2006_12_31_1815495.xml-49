	Ms. O'Connor said that such developments have been far less numerous in New York because the process of obtaining permits is more difficult. The New Immigrant Wave The racial and ethnic makeup of the region is changing rapidly, as the white population shrinks and minority groups grow. Whites still constitute a majority in the suburban region, but the number of white residents dropped to 8.6 million in 2005 from 8.8 million in 2000. The 2005 total amounted to 66 percent of the region's population, down from 69 percent five years earlier. Most of the racial and ethnic demographic changes are being driven by recent immigrants. With large numbers of people arriving from India, China and the Philippines, the Asian-American population has increased 29 percent in five years. And with tens of thousand of new Mexicans and Ecuadoreans, the Hispanic population has grown by 21 percent, according to the census. The African-American population in the region has also grown, but more modestly, about 6 percent. The bulk of new immigrants since 2000 have bypassed New York City, where previous immigrant waves entered to gain an economic foothold before dispersing across the region and the country.
