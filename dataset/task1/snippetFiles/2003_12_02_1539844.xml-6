	Many groups and government agencies stand poised to confront abuses in medicine, to protect the food supply and the environment from big agriculture. Meanwhile, who is watching the pet stores? Or the beauty parlors?
	The science involved in creating the fish is not new. Genes for bioluminescence were introduced into tobacco plants and carrots in the 1980's. Mice have been made to glow. No doubt humans could be made to glow if parents with foresight knew that one day they would be desperately trying to find their middle school child at a dark and crowded school dance.
	The fish were first developed to be indicators of polluted water. Scientists set up the genes for the proteins that produced light to be turned on by the presence of toxins.
	The original fish were hobbled genetically to prevent their spread in the wild. And there is not much worry about the new pets creating a new crisis of global glowing. Zebrafish have long been sold without establishing themselves in the wild.
	But biotechnology itself cannot be successfully hobbled, despite the best intentions of governments or the self-appointed guardians of our health and food supply.
