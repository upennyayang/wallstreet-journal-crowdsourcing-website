	Temperatures in Alaska have risen sharply in the last 30 years, causing sea ice to break up off the northern coastlines, some glaciers to recede and permafrost to melt. But until Dr. Berg began matching rising temperatures to the number of trees killed by beetles, no one had tied the death of a forest nearly twice the size of Yellowstone National Park to warming temperatures.
	Dr. Berg believes the larger culprit is global warming, brought on by increased emissions of greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere. But that is a bigger debate, one which Dr. Berg is normally not a part of. The implication of Dr. Berg's findings for other forests vulnerable to bugs is that as climate warms in the north, some species of evergreen trees that cover vast acreage could be mowed down by an ever-expanding population of beetles.
	The dead spruce forest of Alaska is also a lesson, to some ecologists, of how warmer temperatures present intractable problems for living things anchored to a certain area. People can adapt, or even move, but trees that have been growing in one area for 8,000 years cannot -- at least not quickly enough.
