	Scientists call such an area a ''dead zone,'' and some suggest that this one could portend broader, troubling environmental changes linked to global warming.
	There is little dispute that the dead zone exists; the disagreement centers on whether it matters much. In a state where fishermen are already accustomed to strict regulation, fights with environmentalists and attention from academics, many of them are having none of the notion that there is a larger problem.
	''They say it's global warming and it's Bush's fault, and it just goes on and on and on,'' said Bill Wechter, 53, a crabber who said he had been working here since 1978, had 500 traps stretching north from Newport and had suffered no losses. ''Everybody's guessing.''
	This is the fifth straight year in which a dead zone has appeared here, but scientists say that this one is by far the biggest, covering as much as 1,200 square miles, and that the oxygen levels have been startlingly low in places.
	Those low levels are caused by persistent northerly winds that push nutrient-rich water into shallow areas -- a process known as upwelling -- without being offset by southerly winds that typically flush out the water and effectively keep it from becoming overfertilized.
