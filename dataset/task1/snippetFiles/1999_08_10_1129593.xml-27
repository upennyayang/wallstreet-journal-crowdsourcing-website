	''I haven't really opened my mouth to say I was in pain,'' Dr. Foley quoted the patient as saying, ''and the trade-off has been a total fiasco.''
	Mrs L. added: ''In my stupidity of wanting to stay awake, I say that I'm not in pain, and I find out later that makes it so much more difficult. I want to be awake and know everything that's going on, for as long as humanly possible. But I do not want to die in pain. I do not want to be in pain.''
	More common, pain experts say, are patients who could not hide their pain if they wanted to. Dr. Apkarian said the first patients he studied were suffering from severe hand pain, in each case caused by some kind of accident. In these patients, he said, pain recurred long after the wound had healed, and the patients' hands were often so red and swollen that the nails began to drop off.
	There is certainly no doubt that Mr. Kingsley is in pain. Approaching the huge, doughnut-shaped M.R.I. machine during a recent examination at University Hospital, he moved very slowly, his suffering obvious.
