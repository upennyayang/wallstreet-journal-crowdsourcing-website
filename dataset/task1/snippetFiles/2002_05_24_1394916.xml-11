	But in a letter to American officials, the Jewish Claims Conference, which helped negotiate the slave-labor settlement, has said it does not apply to the Wertheim suit. ''This is not a claim arising from World War II, because the fraud alleged took place in 1951 and afterward,'' said Gideon Taylor, the executive vice president of the conference. Several legal scholars familiar with recent Holocaust claims say they agree. ''Given the facts of the case, the family should have their day in court,'' said Ruti Teitel, a professor at New York Law School who has written on international restitution law. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the Wertheims, like so many European Jews, were cheated of their legacy. They founded the Wertheim corporation in 1875, which expanded until the 1930's. After taking power in 1933, the Nazis passed laws making it difficult, and eventually impossible, for Jews to own or operate businesses. The Wertheim empire, with eight large stores in Berlin, was a special target. The family was forced to give up its shares in the company to businessmen deemed Aryan. Several Wertheim family members died in concentration camps.
