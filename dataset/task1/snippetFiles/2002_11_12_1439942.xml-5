	''If Ulrike Meinhof did not give permission for her body to be used for scientific purposes, then the brain should have been destroyed after her autopsy,'' a state prosecutor in Stuttgart, Eckard Maak, said in an interview that was published on Saturday in the newspaper Bild.
	Few people here mourned the death of Ms. Meinhof, who founded the notorious Red Army Faction with a fellow militant, Andreas Baader, and masterminded a brutal series of kidnappings and assassinations of members of the West German establishment in the early 1970's.
	But the mysteries of Ms. Meinhof's mind were apparently of lasting interest, her daughter said.
	Shortly after Ms. Meinhof died, Ms. Röhl said, her brain was studied at a clinic at the university in Tübingen, on the orders of a prosecutor. The doctors found evidence of neurological abnormalities, which Ms. Röhl says could have been used as mitigating evidence in her trial.
	The condition of Ms. Meinhof's brain had been an issue because of damage she sustained during an operation for a tumor in 1962. The abnormalities found by the doctors in Tübingen, Ms. Röhl contends, might have enabled her lawyers to argue that she was suffering from diminished mental capacity.
