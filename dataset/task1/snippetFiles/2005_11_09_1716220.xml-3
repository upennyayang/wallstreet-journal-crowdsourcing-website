	The vote was a watershed victory for the emerging movement of intelligent design, which posits that nature alone cannot explain life's complexity. John G. West of the Discovery Institute, a conservative research organization that promotes intelligent design, said Kansas now had ''the best science standards in the nation.''
	A leading defender of evolution, Eugenie C. Scott of the National Center for Science Education, said she feared that the standards would become a ''playbook for creationism.''
	The vote came six years after Kansas shocked the scientific and political world by stripping its curriculum standards of virtually any mention of evolution, a move reversed in 2001 after voters ousted several conservative members of the education board.
	A new conservative majority took hold in 2004 and promptly revived arguments over the teaching of evolution. The ugly and highly personal nature of the debate was on display at the Tuesday meeting, where board members accused one other of dishonesty and disingenuousness.
	''This is a sad day, not just for Kansas kids, but for Kansas,'' Janet Waugh of Kansas City, Kan., one of four dissenting board members, said before the vote. ''We're becoming a laughingstock not only of the nation but of the world.''
