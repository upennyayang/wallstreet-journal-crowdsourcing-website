	WHAT sets SpaceX apart from other rocket makers is that the boldness of its ambition is matched by the modesty of its design. To meet his goal of a cheap and reliable rocket, Mr. Musk is producing a basic design, with fewer opportunities for systems to fail -- even if it means some technical compromises with performance. ''SpaceX is optimizing for simplicity rather than performance, and that's what sets it apart from the others,'' said Jeffrey Foust, an analyst at the Futron Corporation, an aerospace consulting firm. ''When you have a limited number of things that could fail, you can increase a rocket's reliability.''
	Where most other rockets have multiple stages and multiple engines, the Falcon will have just two stages, each with one engine. Most of SpaceX's stages are designed to be reusable. Although fishing small used rockets out of a vast ocean can be difficult, Mr. Musk says that it is cheaper than building a new one every time.
	''Throwing away multimillion-dollar rocket stages every flight,'' he said, ''makes no more sense than chucking away a 747 after every flight.''
	Instead of buying engines from established suppliers, Mr. Musk has designed his own and built them in-house.
