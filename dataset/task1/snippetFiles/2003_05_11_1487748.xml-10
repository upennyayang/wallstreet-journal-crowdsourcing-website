	Jonathan Michael Simms was born in 1984. He ate meat nearly every day and grew up healthy and strong, a talented soccer player with a shot at going pro. It was during his trials for Northern Ireland's national team, in September 2001, that his first symptoms appeared. He performed so clumsily, his parents wondered if he was losing interest in the sport. He took offense at the suggestion.
	About two weeks after the trials, Jonathan was talking with his father in the living room of their tiny row house. The boy turned to leave, and Don watched him reach out and steady himself on the door frame. ''Have you been drinking?'' Don asked. Jonathan said no, but his speech was slurred. Don admits to a hot temper, and the argument that followed was a bruising one. It still haunts his parents and hangs over every choice they have made since that day.
	''I accused him of drinking and taking drugs,'' Don says. ''His body was turning on him, and I went and said those ugly things. I've asked his forgiveness many times since then, and he has given it. But the pain will never go away.''
