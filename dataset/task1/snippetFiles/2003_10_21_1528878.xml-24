	Dr. Banfield, who is working with the Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute in nearby Walnut Creek, says there are probably just seven different species in the sample, either bacteria or archaea, another type of microbe that tends to inhabit extreme environments. The full genomes of the two organisms have already been determined. ''As far as I know, it's the first time a genome has been recovered from a truly environmental sample,'' she said.
	There are some obstacles to overcome before even trying to put the DNA fragments together into the correct order. Extracting DNA fragments from the environment can be difficult, particularly from soil, which contains acids that break down the genetic material. And one or two species may dominate in an environment, outnumbering other species by as much as 100,000 to 1. So the DNA fragments will be mainly from the dominant species.
	''When somebody says they are going to sequence all the bacteria in a soil sample, well, that's rubbish,'' said Dr. Julian Davies, an emeritus professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of British Columbia.
	Dr. Davies started a company to find new antibiotics by extracting genes from soil bacteria that could not be cultured in the laboratory.
