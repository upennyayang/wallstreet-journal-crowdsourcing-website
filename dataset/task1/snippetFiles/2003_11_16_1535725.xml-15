	Eric Salathe, 38, a research scientist at the University of Washington, said he had been a patient of Dr. Jon P. Younger at the Polyclinic for about three years when he received a letter in 2002 informing him of a $20 monthly charge to continue as his patient. Mr. Salathe said he didn't think a newsletter and extra time with Dr. Younger justified the added expense, so he switched doctors. ''It wasn't going to be $240 worth of value,'' he said, adding that his new physician ''is just as good and doesn't charge me extra.''
	Dr. Younger said 300 of the 850 patients who were notified of the fee had left his practice. ''Most of them were sort of marginally my patients anyway, young people who would see me once every two or three years,'' he said.
	Some patients say that paying the extra money is worth it. ''Most doctors, it's one-two-three, they want to get rid of you,'' said Bernard Kessler, another of Dr. Younger's patients. Mr. Kessler, 86, had just finished a half-hour physical with the doctor. ''This doctor gives you as much time as you need.''
