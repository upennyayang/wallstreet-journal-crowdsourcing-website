	The allure of such sites is that they give the traveler direct access to the same information available to travel agents. Like most travel agencies, these on-line services are free -- other than the cost of the Internet connection. While it is true that the personal relationship with a travel agent is lost, there are other compensations.
	Some automated systems today can notify travelers by pager the minute a flight schedule or gate is changed, or by electronic mail when special fares appear for favorite airline routes. A Web-savvy younger generation and others who have embraced the new technology relish fending for themselves. As a result, some analysts anticipate that the traditional travel agency will eventually become an endangered species.
	Smart virtual agents, perhaps overseen by smart human travel agents, will someday roam the Internet armed with a dossier of a client's personal and price preferences, said Andrew B. Whinston, a professor of information systems at the University of Texas at Austin, whose expertise is electronic commerce. The software agents, Mr. Whinston said, could quickly construct a comprehensive and complex itinerary of air tickets, hotels, rental cars, restaurant reservations, theater tickets, shopping discounts, sightseeing schedules, reading lists, baby-sitting services, and so on -- all for a predetermined budget.
