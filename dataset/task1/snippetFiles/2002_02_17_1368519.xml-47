	One also gets the sense that he enjoys this role, that the search for the ship is a series of auditions for the final stardom. Only in a city where life proceeds with cinematic pomp would a shipwreck seeker be an actor. Mr. Governali, who says he studied with an acting teacher named Joe Paradise, has learned his lessons well.
	''He gets into the nature of everything,'' Mr. Governali said of Mr. Paradise. ''It's not about acting. It's about the emotion behind the person, what he feels, what he wants, what he needs. His spine, he calls it.''
	Mr. Governali wants this ship. He says he has asked the British government for permission to salvage. He says he wants an Anglican bishop on board to administer last rites when the ship is found. If further proof were needed of the extent to which the search for the Hussar has penetrated his character, he offers a small confession. ''My stage name is Joey Treasures,'' he says sheepishly. Then he shrugs, as Tony Soprano would after revealing some inner moment to Dr. Melfi. ''You know us Italians. We gotta have nicknames.''
