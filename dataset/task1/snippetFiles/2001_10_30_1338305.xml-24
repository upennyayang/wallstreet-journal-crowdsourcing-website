	Q. What have your studies of Creole languages taught you about human nature? A. That humans have to speak. It shows you that no matter what hideous situation you put a person in, humans will go and create a complex language where they can talk. There's a school in Bluefields, Nicaragua, founded for deaf kids. Before this school, the kids had been communicating with their families as best they could. But after a few years of being together at the school, this new language spontaneously developed, a full language, a kind of pidgin sign language, where they could communicate with each other in a permanent way. Then younger kids were brought in, and they begin speaking (or signing) this brilliant Creole language that didn't exist before. They couldn't hear. But they created a language. Q. Some weeks ago, Dr. Anthony P. Monaco at Oxford announced he'd found a gene that is connected to human speech. What was your reaction when you read of his discovery? A. I believe that there is much evidence to suggest that our capacity to speak is largely a function of cognitive machinery. The Monaco findings square with this.
