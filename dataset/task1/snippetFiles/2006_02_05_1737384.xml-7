	In a word, the brain has become a pop star.
	But is its glossy, computer-enhanced image a superficial one? What does it really tell us about how we function, what motivates us, who we are? An image with this much charisma surely presents opportunities to re-imagine ourselves in a better light; but what are the hazards inherent in fawning over what are, after all, computer graphics?
	Neuroscientists themselves debate these questions constantly, and even agree, if uneasily, on some of the answers. First, it is beyond doubt that brain images reveal real biological activity that is associated with genuine human sensations.
	''This is what accounts for the sheer delight, the true amazement people have when they see these images: they show that there is a measurable physical response in the brain to things like being in love,'' said Dr. Lucy Brown, a neuroscientist at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine in the Bronx. ''Everyone thought phenomena like love and jealousy were simply impossible to study, that they were too variable, too individual. They preferred to think of them as magic.''
	Imaging and other techniques have now parted the curtain.
