	REPRESENTATIVE BOEHLERT: Mr. Administrator, I want to thank you very much. Before we wrap up, I just want to touch on a couple of more points. I want to bring clarity to a very important issue. I think it should be self-evident that the Congress is committee to the proposition, on a bipartisan, bicameral basis, that we need to strengthen the evidence supporting the assertion that the Columbia accident investigation board is truly independent. I know the message has been sent and I think it's been received, and I know it's been heard. And I want some assurance that it'll be heeded. So I'd like you to visit that a little bit more and comment. I carefully listened to you as you said you will consult with Admiral Gehman, but I hope you're hearing what Congress is saying. We are the ones -- and others, too -- insisting that we get some clarity to this issue. So can you address that a little bit more for me?
	A. Yes, sir. No, I appreciate your patience on it and I do not mean to equivocate in any way, shape or form.
