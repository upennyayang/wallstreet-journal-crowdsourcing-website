	Now that thousands of volunteers have journeyed to Iowa to canvass for Dr. Dean, it seems clear that this get-out-the vote operation called the Perfect Storm has succeeded on at least one front. Talk to just about any of the Dean door-to-door missionaries and you will discover that their work has made them feel very good about taking back their country. But what about the Iowans they have been visiting? Are the locals paying any attention to the fervent out-of-staters in fluorescent orange stocking caps? How many Iowans actually want to take back their country? How many even knew it was missing? To try to answer those questions, we hit the pavement on Tuesday with a team of four Dean volunteers who had paid their way to Iowa from Colorado, Minnesota, Vermont and New York City. In order not to bias the experiment by dampening their ardor, we did not inform them that some skeptical Iowan politicians had taken to calling the orange-topped hordes the Perfect Stormtroopers. Nor did we mention that one of the state's most famous songs is called ''Iowa Stubborn'' and celebrates the locals' hostility to new people and new ideas.
