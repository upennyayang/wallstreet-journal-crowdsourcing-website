	''I try to make it a familylike atmosphere,'' Ms. Queler said. This can mean communal cold-cut lunches during coaching sessions, an orchestra musician's child playing silently but energetically on the sidelines during a rehearsal or the traditional pot-luck dinner for the cast a day or so before each Carnegie Hall performance.
	In keeping with the family spirit, the small paid staff is helped by a group of volunteers, all willing to pitch in to do whatever needs to be done, without standing too much on ceremony. As general manager, Ms. Barthelmes finds herself doing everything from organizing rehearsal space to chasing down the bathroom key during one of the opera-logues.
	However the product is made, it can generate tremendous enthusiasm. On a good night -- and it has only one chance at a good night with each production -- the Opera Orchestra gets Carnegie Hall to rock. From Leonie Rysanek's magnificent performance in Janacek's ''Jenufa'' in 1988 to last year's ''Lucrezia Borgia'' with Ms. Fleming and Stephanie Blythe, eyewitness accounts indicate screaming, cheering audiences giving ovation after ovation.
	''I've never felt anything like that in the house,'' Mr. Harrelson said.
