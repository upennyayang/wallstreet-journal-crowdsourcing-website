	Bonds disputed the notion that anything could put into question his records, including the 73 homers he hit for a single-season mark, and the fact that he is two short of tying Willie Mays, his godfather, for third place on the career home run list with 660. (Only Babe Ruth with 714 and Henry Aaron with 755 are ahead of them.) ''If you want to be on top, you have to have broad shoulders,'' Bonds said. ''When you get on top, people want to knock you down. You have to be man enough to step up to the plate and be able and take it.'' In December, Bonds was one of several professional athletes who testified before a federal grand jury investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, or Balco, a supplements company. Two Balco executives and a track coach were charged with Anderson. Bonds said that speculation about his connection to the case would not affect this season, but that the death of his father had been a great emotional hurdle for him. ''I had a hard time getting back into the batting cage over the winter,'' he said.
