	After an hour and a half of climbing, I took a lunch break on a fallen tree. Just as I was finishing, I heard a voice: ''Oh, there's that English guy. Do you mind if we share your log?'' The woman and her husband sat down beside me. I hadn't noticed him at the ticket booth; he walked with a white cane. The couple explained that they tried to do the hike every year. I was impressed: the trail was steep and rough. ''What brings you here from England?'' ''Well, actually I don't live there any more. I live in Madison, Wis.'' It emerged that I taught at the university. ''What department?'' English. ''You must know our daughter then. She's a graduate student in your department.'' She mentioned her daughter's name. ''Yes, of course I know her. I just finished grading her paper for the memoir course last week. Good essay, by the way.'' The student's mother peered at me. ''You must be the South African professor she mentioned. No, but you're English.'' ''Well, yes and no. Sort of both. And neither.'' I stumbled through some halting rendition of my identity.
