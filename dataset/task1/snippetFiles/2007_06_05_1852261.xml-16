	Pediatricians, psychiatrists and psychologists mostly ignored Ms. Ayers's message at the time, and most do so today. Occupational therapists are not M.D.'s, many don't have Ph.D.'s, and they have little voice in mainstream medicine. But increasing numbers of parents have been listening, particularly in the last few years. To explain why, they usually point to their own children.
	''All I know is that when I heard a loud sound in first grade, I hid under my desk,'' said Matthew Pougnet, who just finished third grade and lives in Denver with his parents and two brothers.
	A capable student who seemed unable to relax, Matthew soon was told he had attention deficit disorder and was given a prescription for the stimulant drug Ritalin. ''It made no difference at all,'' his father, Anthony Pougnet, said in an interview.
	Convinced there was more to it than that, the Pougnets found their way to the Sensory Therapies and Research Center near Denver, a clinic devoted to treatment and study of sensory problems in children and adults. The center's director, Lucy J. Miller, an occupational therapist, is the country's leading research scientist specializing in sensory processing disorder.
