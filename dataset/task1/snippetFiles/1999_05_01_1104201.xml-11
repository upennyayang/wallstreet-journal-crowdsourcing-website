	What surprised them even more, however, was that those who looked to religious-right organizations like the Christian Coalition for guidance in voting were more likely to report ''significant 'pro-poor' giving habits.'' They were strikingly likely to report giving ''a lot''. The limits of this analysis do not escape the authors. From the standpoint of the poor, attitudes toward government assistance, tax relief and health care, or attitudes toward unemployment, economic growth and unionization, may have far greater consequences for well-being than personal charity. Then there are the inevitable shortcomings of survey data. What definitions exist in the respondents' mind of organizations that help ''the poor and needy''? What do they have in mind by giving ''a lot''? The random differences can be assumed to cancel one another out. But what if liberal Protestants or, for that matter, college-educated evangelicals consistently had a more stringent notion of what constitutes ''a lot''? Systematic differences among religious, political or demographic categories in understanding those questions would skew the results. Nonetheless, public debate about justice for the poor often slides from what means will best accomplish what goals to ad hominem judgments about the motives and attitudes of the debaters.
