	Compared with officials in Olympic sports like track and field, which has been testing for steroids since the late 1960's, many in baseball seem far behind the learning curve. ''I've never seen or heard of a pitcher that wanted to do that because it would add bulk, and that's the worst thing you can do as a pitcher,'' Ray Miller of the Baltimore Orioles, one of the game's most highly respected pitching coaches, said of steroids. Others, in and out of baseball, disagree. Dr. Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor and steroids expert who testified before Congress in March, said in an interview that ''given the competition to keep their jobs and the money involved, I can't believe that a significant percent of pitchers haven't tried this.'' ''But I don't know what a significant percent translates to,'' he said. Bronson Arroyo, a right-handed pitcher for Boston, said: ''I don't think it was out of the question for just as many pitchers as position players to be on it. Who wouldn't want to throw three or four miles harder if they could?''
