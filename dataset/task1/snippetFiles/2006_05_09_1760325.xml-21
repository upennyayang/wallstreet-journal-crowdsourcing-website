	In past years, the scientists usually enjoyed at least the illusion of being on a solid surface, with their man-made hole being the only open water for more than a thousand yards around.
	This time, said James Johnson, a University of Washington engineer who helped design the instrument chains, they were essentially camped on an ice raft not much larger than a football field that was surrounded by patches of black, steaming water. As the days passed, the ice beneath them became progressively laced with disconcerting cracks, Mr. Johnson said.
	Independent sea ice experts at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., said the weaker ice, the fog and the open water seen by the team at the North Pole were consistent with their latest measurements of the overall conditions on the Arctic Ocean. They have measured big retreats in the floating ice in recent summers, including a modern record in 2005, and the ice did not rebuild in recent months as it usually does in the deep freeze and long nights of the Arctic winter, said Mark C. Serreze, a senior scientist at the center.
