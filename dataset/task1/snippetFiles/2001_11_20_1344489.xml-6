	Causes of Hair Loss
	Before blaming one parent or another for your hair loss, it is worth noting that in both men and women, the genetic tendency to develop male or female pattern hair loss can be inherited from both sides of the family.
	In a normal full head of hair, about 90 percent of the hairs are in a growing phase, called anagen, that lasts one to seven years. The remaining 10 percent of hairs are in a resting phase called telogen that lasts about three months, after which the resting hairs start falling out. Anything that shortens the anagen phase or increases the proportion of hairs in telogen can result in excessive hair loss.
	For example, in the last three months of pregnancy, the hormones that stimulate fetal growth also stimulate hair growth, throwing about 99 percent of hairs into anagen, with only 1 percent remaining in a resting phase, explained Dr. David A Whiting, a dermatologist at the Baylor Hair Research and Treatment Center in Dallas.
	After childbirth, he said, 20 to 30 percent of hairs go into telogen, and suddenly, about three months after giving birth, women start losing large amounts of hair.
