	Dr. Meredith said that Dr. Reynolds had rejected both plans through a lawyer and had refused to discuss her post with a university trustee.
	A spokeswoman at Birmingham said yesterday that Dr. Reynolds was not available for an interview.
	No one is saying officially why her tenure is an issue now. Dr. Reynolds is 63. She has been at the university four years. At a time when taxpayer support has shrunk, her campus is in the middle of a hugely successful fund-raising campaign. Last year the board agreed to raise the target to $350 million from $250 million, which the campus has surpassed.
	In addition, after a bumpy start, Dr. Reynolds, who has a reputation for being combative, now has strong support from many students, professors, alumni, local residents and religious groups. Some university donors have threatened to withhold contributions if Dr. Reynolds is dismissed. And on Tuesday, faculty leaders sent a letter to the board, saying that ''any movement to remove Dr. Reynolds at this time would be counterproductive to the mission of U.A.B.''
	In Birmingham, Dr. Reynolds has been nicknamed the ''woman warrior'' and earned a reputation for strong leadership and passionate loyalty.
