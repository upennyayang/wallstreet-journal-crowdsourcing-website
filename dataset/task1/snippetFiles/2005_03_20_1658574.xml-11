	So where people once took illegal drugs like cocaine to escape or stimulate creativity, they now take legal drugs to focus better and achieve more.
	The danger in that, said Carl Elliott, the author of ''Better than Well: American Medicine Meets the American Dream,'' is that not performing well will be seen as a medical condition -- one that needs to be treated.
	''The lines between treating an illness and enhancing a performance are so blurry,'' said Dr. Elliott, an associate professor at the center for bioethics at the University of Minnesota. ''Most people don't conceptualize it as performance enhancement; most people conceptualize it as a treatment for an illness.''
	But others think there's no problem. Norman Fost, the director of the medical ethics program at the University of Wisconsin who has long said that the danger of steroids are overstated, similarly sees nothing wrong with taking drugs like Ritalin or Provigil solely to enhance performance.
	''We all would like to do better at what we're doing, whether athletic or intellectual or musical,'' he said. ''There's nothing inherently immoral about performance enhancement. It's what everyone does, or would try to do, for their children.
