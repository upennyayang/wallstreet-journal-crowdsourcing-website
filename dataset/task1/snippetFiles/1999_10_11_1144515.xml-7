	But over the next week, while less and less was said about No Gun Ri, more and more was said about Mr. Ventura. The Reform Party's national chairman had denounced Mr. Ventura shortly after the first news accounts of the Playboy interview. Mr. Ventura defended himself and did not apologize. On Sunday morning, the Governor's remarks were revisited on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
	On Monday, the Ventura coverage escalated. His statements were again dissected in a Newsweek cover article focusing on him and the may-be Presidential candidates Warren Beatty and Donald J. Trump.
	The brouhaha was back on ABC's evening news on Monday and was featured on CNN's ''Larry King Live.'' Mr. Ventura declined to appear, but his former colleague Hulk Hogan was there.
	On Wednesday, Oct. 6, Mr. Ventura was at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government taping a segment of CNBC's ''Hardball With Chris Matthews.'' That evening, the Harvard appearance was featured on NBC's evening news.
	The No Gun Ri and Playboy-Ventura reports broke the same day. Both were fueled by new developments a day or two later.
