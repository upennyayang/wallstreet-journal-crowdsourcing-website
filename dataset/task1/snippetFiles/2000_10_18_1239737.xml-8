	When taken together, all of the statements made yesterday suggest that New York City, at least in the short term, is unlikely to follow the lead of Californians, who voted to eliminate bilingual education in 1998, and Arizonans, who, according to statewide polls, are expected to vote overwhelmingly next month to dismantle the state's bilingual system.
	''I am here today not because I want to eliminate bilingual programs, but rather to express my concern about public schools,'' said Norma Flores, 35, a native of Mexico whose 9-year-old son attends a bilingual elementary school in East Harlem. ''We need to sharpen bilingual education so our students can learn and preserve their native language.''
	Ms. Flores was one of a dozen parents brought to the hearing by leaders of the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, an umbrella organization of neighborhood groups that has been harshly critical of bilingual education.
	But like the other parents who spoke yesterday, many of them describing in emotional detail how the system had failed their children, Ms. Flores testified that current classes for limited English learners, however flawed, could be improved with more money, better qualified teachers and principals who are willing to explain the various options to parents.
