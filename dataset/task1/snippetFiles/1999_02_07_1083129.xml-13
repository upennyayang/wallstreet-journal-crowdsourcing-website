	One site, Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), reports that it has more than five million registered users. Preview Travel (www.previewtravel.com) claims six million. Microsoft's Expedia (www.expedia.msn.com), which recently reported more than $10 million in weekly travel sales -- car, air and hotel only -- claims more than four million registered users in the United States and Canada. America Online, with more than 15 million subscribers, is adding a new section for business travelers later this month. Leisure travel is already one of the most popular topics among AOL's subscribers, said Pam McGraw, a company spokeswoman.
	There are hundreds of smaller Internet sites and on-line information services. Many of them are maintained as hobbies or public services by travel enthusiasts, but in the past two years corporate behemoths have been willing to spend tens of millions of dollars on elaborate sites and E-commerce systems in the belief that profits will eventually accrue. So far, spending is still outpacing revenue, services like Expedia and Travelocity say.
	The allure of such sites is that they give the traveler direct access to the same information available to travel agents.
