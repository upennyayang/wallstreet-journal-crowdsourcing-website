	Mr. Doerr said: ''When I met them, it was truly an open question. Should they work on other pharmaceuticals? Chemicals? And while my passion -- and theirs -- was for fuels and solving global warming, it wasn't at all obvious that they could make a better fuel.''
	Cheap biofuels could eliminate or reduce the use of the fossil fuels whose combustion contributes to climate change. So far, most biofuel ventures have tried to create better ethanol fuels by converting different kinds of ''biomass'' -- everything from corn to sugar cane to switchgrass and jatropha trees -- to fermentable sugars. These sugars can then be brewed and distilled into conventional ethanol.
	Amyris chose to ask something more basic and more interesting: What would perfect fuels look like if they were designed from scratch? The start-up decided to concentrate on the second stage of creating a biofuel: fermenting sugars into fuel.
	The company wanted chemical compounds that could be fermented from sugars derived from any biomass. The fuels had to have an energy content higher than ethanol and be useable in today's automobile, diesel and jet engines. Finally, the company wanted fuels that were insoluble in water, and hence could be transported through the same pipelines that now move oil.
