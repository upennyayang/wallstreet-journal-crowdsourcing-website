	EVERYDAY it seems that another collectible is sold for a record price. Consider three widely publicized sales in the last month. Babe Ruth's contract, which sent him from the Red Sox to the Yankees in 1919, went for nearly $1 million. A 1913 Liberty Head nickel went for $4.15 million, up from $3 million a year earlier. And a 1918 upside-down biplane stamp sold for $525,000, more than three times its pre-auction estimated price.
	Are collectibles a sound financial investment? If the past is any guide, the answer is no. Historically, collectibles have yielded a much lower return than stocks and carried more risk.
	Benjamin J. Burton of Lehman Brothers and Joyce P. Jacobsen of Wesleyan University conducted an exhaustive summary of studies that estimated the financial return from investing in collectibles in an article published in The Journal of Economic Perspectives in 1999. They examined the payoff from holding several kinds of collectibles, including art, wine, antiques, ceramics, coins, stamps, books and Beanie Babies.
	Measuring the return from investing in collectibles is difficult because the items that are sold each year are not identical and some items are rarely sold.
