	His work had gained the attention of Dr. David A. Kessler, who was the Food and Drug Administration commissioner under the elder President George Bush and President Bill Clinton.
	In his book ''A Question of Intent: A Great American Battle With a Deadly Industry,'' published last year, Dr. Kessler said of Dr. Slade, ''From the beginning of our investigation, he sent us a steady stream of information.''
	''Over the years, he scoured the libraries and read everything he could find about the history and public health aspects of tobacco,'' Dr. Kessler wrote. ''He asked friends in banking and advertising to funnel information about the industry to him.''
	At a 1995 news conference, President Clinton called tobacco ''highly addictive'' and ordered the F.D.A. to restrict the advertising, promotion, distribution and marketing of cigarettes to teenagers.
	Ms. Kaufman of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation attended the news conference with Dr. Slade. ''Outside of the day that I married my wife,'' Ms. Kaufman quoted Dr. Slade as saying, ''this is the most incredible thing that has ever happened to me, because it culminates all the work I put in.''
	The same day, the tobacco industry sued to block the F.D.A.
