	''I think by far the issue that could have the most far-ranging impact is the standing issue,'' said Jeffrey Holmstead, who until recently was assistant administrator for air and radiation at the E.P.A. ''Just because if the court determines that these petitioners don't have standing, what that means is the federal courts really won't be available for people who want to bring lawsuits related to climate change.''
	Mr. Holmstead, who is a partner at Bracewell &amp; Giuliani, a lobbying firm, added, ''From my perspective, I think that's not a bad thing because I don't think the courts are equipped to deal with issues like this.''
	Environmental groups are also concentrating heavily on the question of the agency's authority, under the Clean Air Act, to regulate carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases as air pollutants.
	Paul D. Clement, the solicitor general, opposes this, saying in his brief not only that Massachusetts and the other petitioners lack standing, but also that the action they seek would have little impact on global climate change. The United States transportation sector, which is mostly made up of passenger vehicles, accounted for about 7 percent of worldwide fossil-fuel emissions in the 1990s.
