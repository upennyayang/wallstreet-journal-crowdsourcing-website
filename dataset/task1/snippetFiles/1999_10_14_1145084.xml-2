	But like Yellowstone in North America, the park is incomplete. The whole Serengeti ecosystem, as defined by the migration route of a million ox-like antelopes called wildebeests (gnus to crossword puzzle fans), is the size of the country of Kuwait and extends into the Masai Mara Game Reserve just across the Kenyan border. It seems odd, then, that Nature: Virtual Serengeti, a CD-ROM spinoff from the PBS television program, never sets foot in Tanzania. All its action takes place in Kenya, much of it at sites far beyond the Serengeti, like Lake Nakuru. And while some of the five dozen video clips are truly exciting -- I'm thinking in particular of 35 seconds that show a cheetah running down a Thomson's gazelle or a scene of crocodiles tearing into a hapless zebra -- they largely fail to convey the vastness of the Serengeti, the role of the animals in their respective habitats and especially the struggles of the dry season. That is when immense wildebeest herds, trailed by predatory lions, cheetahs and African wild dogs and scavenging hyenas, trek north to find green pastures beyond the park boundary.
