	Emily Thompson, a 38-year-old assistant professor who began her career working at Bell Labs in Holmdel who is now in her sixth year at the university, will lead the expedition to the Edison Museum, where students will be provided with a special screening of Edison's recordings.

	''Dyer was more interested in the gambling, while I wanted to learn about probabilities,'' said Ms. Chiacco.
	As Professor Wyner put it, they will get a healthy dose of both.
