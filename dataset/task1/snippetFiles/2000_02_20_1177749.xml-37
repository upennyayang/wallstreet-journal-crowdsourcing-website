	When the sea lions approached close, seemingly as curious about us as we were about them, their big brown eyes were encircled by light fur that looked like makeup. One sea lion played with a conch shell as if it were a ball. We all played for half an hour.
	Back on board, we motored to Bartolome Island during lunch. As always, there was a choice: shrimp, chicken, or spaghetti.
	For our final snorkel of the day -- this time ''my'' wetsuit went to somebody else -- we visited the penguins. Galapagos penguins are among the world's smallest, standing about 18 inches tall. They are little but they are loud. These pipsqueaks open their tiny bills and make a sound like a foghorn. It has to be seen and heard to be believed. They perched on lava outcroppings, and occasionally one of them would dive into the water and swim with us. They weren't as playful as the sea lions, but they weren't afraid of us either.
	''Penguin to your left!'' Taylor yelled.
	There the little bridegroom was at my fingertips. He was almost small enough to be Tom Dewey on top of a wedding cake.
