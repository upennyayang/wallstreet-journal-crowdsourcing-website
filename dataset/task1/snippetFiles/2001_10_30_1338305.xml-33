	Q. You said that the most important fact about language is that it is undergoing constant change. Given that, how do you feel about language purists?
	A. They labor under the misimpression that language only changes for the worse. They don't understand that the language we are speaking now arose from the same kinds of changes that they today condemn as mistakes.
	Q. Do you think there's a psychological component to the positions of language purists?
	A. I think language purists tend to be people who have a natural bent for order. I have some sympathy for them. In another universe, I could be one. If you're a linguist, however, you see how ultimately illogical and hopeless this orientation is. Language never has followed the rules of logic.
	There's no language on earth where mathematical logic and its grammar correspond neatly. This misimpression underlies a lot of what rankles the language purists. Language is like one of those lava lamps from the 70's -- there are no grounds for considering the clump of lava at one point in the lamp more ''appropriate'' than at any other.
