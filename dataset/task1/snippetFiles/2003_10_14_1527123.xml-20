	So a male túngara is caught between two evolutionary pressures. And as Darwin himself pointed out, sexual selection creates paradoxical traits in males of many species, like huge peacock tails -- so useless for flight, so good for impressing peahens. To a biologist who thinks traits serve fitness here and now, all this is just natural selection with an extra step. In the case of the túngara, for instance, the big, hearty male frog who can take the risk of ending up in a bat stomach is the best possible mate. Risking death is a show of strength and quality, a sign of ''good genes.'' So females evolved to prefer the loud chuck that so appeals to bats. Dr. Ryan was giving a talk along those lines a dozen years ago and ad libbed. Of course, he said, this idea could be tested by comparing the túngara species, Physalaemus pustulosus, to its near relatives -- other species of frog whose mating call is all whines, no chucks. That comparison surprised him. Dr. Ryan's colleague Dr. Walt Wilczynski, a neuroscientist, established that the hearing systems of the species Physalaemus coloradorum are tuned to be sensitive to the same frequencies as the túngara ear.
