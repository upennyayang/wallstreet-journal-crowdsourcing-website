	''It crosses a boundary of good taste,'' Dr. Caldwell said, calling phantom energy ''bad news stuff.'' Phantom energy violates physicists' intuitions about how the universe should behave. A chunk of it could be used to prop open wormholes in space and time -- and thus create time machines, for example.
	''It could lead to such bizarre effects as negative kinetic energy,'' Dr. Krauss said. As a result, objects like atoms would be able to lose energy by speeding up.
	Nevertheless, a recent analysis by Dr. Caldwell and his Dartmouth colleague Dr. Michael Doran of the supernova measurements to date, combined with other cosmological data, suggest that w could lie anywhere from minus 0.8 to minus 1.25, leaving open the possibility of phantom energy. The cosmological constant would give a value of minus 1.0, and anything higher would be a sign of quintessence.
	Dr. Kirshner said phantom energy had been dismissed as ''too strange'' when his group was doing calculations of dark energy back in 1998. In retrospect, he said, that was not the right thing to do.
	''It sounds wacky,'' he said, referring to phantom energy, ''but I think we're in a situation where we're going to need a really new idea.
