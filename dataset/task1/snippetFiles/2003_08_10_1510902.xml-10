	The report praises the way that the consortium and 1199/S.E.I.U., New York's largest health care union, often work together to train home-care workers or nurse's aides to become licensed practical nurses at double the pay.
	Joseph McDermott, executive director of the Consortium for Worker Education, at 275 Seventh Avenue at 25th Street in Manhattan, said that even though the bulk of its training was for union members, it trained thousands of nonunion members each year. The consortium offers training for nonunion workers to become commercial truck drivers, child-care workers, computer operators, construction workers and bakers.
	Many of its programs for nonunion workers are financed by foundations and by federal, state and city money. Some of the programs are for nonunion workers who lost their jobs because of the Sept. 11 attack. Ms. Zou's computer training program is financed by the September 11 Fund.
	Bonnie Potter, executive director of the New York City Employment and Training Coalition, said union programs were much better financed than government-financed programs. ''In the public-funded system, you're required to get people out of training as soon as possible,'' she said.
