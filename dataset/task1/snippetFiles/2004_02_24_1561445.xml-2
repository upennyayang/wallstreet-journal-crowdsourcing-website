	Bonds, who won his sixth Most Valuable Player award last season, arrived at the San Francisco Giants' training camp at Scottsdale Stadium in a blue T-shirt and black jogging pants and looking as robust as he has in several years past, despite a newspaper report that he had lost 20 pounds.
	''I'm about 225, maybe heavier,'' said the 6-foot-2 Bonds, who broke into the major leagues as a 186-pound outfielder with Pittsburgh in 1986. He has attributed his increased bulk to weight lifting, nutrition and the use of legal supplements. ''People in my gym in San Francisco -- where I go five days a week, from a couple of weeks after the season to spring training -- say they wish they could tell the media how hard I work in the gym,'' Bonds said as he sat on the dugout bench. ''I tell them, 'Don't worry about it, I'm a big boy.' I'll just let my bat do all the talking.''
	Bonds, who will turn 40 in July, said he would welcome more drug testing by Major League Baseball, which now tests every player once in spring training and, if there is probable cause, individual players randomly during the season.
