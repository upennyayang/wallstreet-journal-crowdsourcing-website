	The travails of the Nets have been drama enough to captivate a small but passionate core of fans like Mr. Vincenzo.
	A native of Staten Island, Mr. Vincenzo was drawn to the Nets the last time they made a run at respectability in the 80's, although he had been aware of them since the high-flying days of Julius Erving. The team, then called the New York Nets, played on Long Island as part of the fledgling American Basketball Association and won two championships in that league, in 1974 and 1976.
	In 1976, the N.B.A. and the A.B.A. merged and, to resolve a salary dispute, the Nets sold the rights to much-loved Dr. J. to Philadelphia. The deal presaged a 25-year downward spiral that began with the Nets holding the N.B.A.'s worst record (22 wins, 60 losses) during its first year in the league. The trend was reversed with last summer's trade of Stephon Marbury to the Phoenix Suns for Jason Kidd, a move that many credit with reviving the franchise.
	And there were plenty of lowlights in between. The death of rising star Drazen Petrovic.
