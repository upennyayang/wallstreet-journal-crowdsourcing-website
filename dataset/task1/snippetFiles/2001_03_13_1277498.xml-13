	Q. What are your qualifications to run a mad cow Web site, and how much time do you spend on it?
	A. On the sheepskin side, Harvard undergraduate, graduate work in molecular biology at U.C. San Diego and Ph.D. in mathematics at University of Oregon. Former college professor at the University of Texas medical school and Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania. I've gotten very fast at assembling and synthesizing data. I have a lot of people helping me.
	Q. Do you ever feel you are a threat to officials in government laboratories or the cattle industry who don't like what you have to say?
	A. When I first started this, friends said, ''Tom, some rancher is going to come by your house at night and poison your dog.'' Well, now I know they wouldn't do that. They've hired a public relations agency instead that is trying to discredit me as just another gadfly. I don't make the news. I don't write the articles. I don't create the events. I'm basically a clearinghouse for information that everyone wants. The problem for industry and government is that this disease is out of anybody's control.
