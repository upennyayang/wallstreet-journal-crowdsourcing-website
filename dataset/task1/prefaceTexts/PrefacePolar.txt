SENTIMENT: The text is charged with sentiment and emotions

The following texts have different degrees of sentiment. Provide ratings to indicate the degree of sentiment in the text. 

Sentiment refers to positive or negative opinion towards something. Emotion relates to feelings--happiness, sadness, anger, embarrassment etc. For this task, indicate the extent to which the text is filled with sentiment and emotions. For an example, a heated debate about a social topic will have a lot of sentiment and emotion. On the other hand, a chapter from a high school science textbook is likely to have little sentiment and emotion. Give an overall rating depending on both aspects.
