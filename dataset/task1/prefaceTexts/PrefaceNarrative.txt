NARRATIVE: The text tells me a story 

The following texts have different degrees of narrative style. Rate them to indicate the degree to which the text is a narrative. 

For example, an essay where I describe my summer vacation would have a narrative style. On the other hand, a chapter from a biology textbook could have an explanatory and non-narrative style. A narrative can be thought of as having two things at a minimum. It has characters or protagonists who play a role in the story and there are events associated with them. There is also some sequence or progression of events. The events are related and happen in some order.  Since these texts are snippets and not full articles, you will be judging if they could be part of a narrative.
