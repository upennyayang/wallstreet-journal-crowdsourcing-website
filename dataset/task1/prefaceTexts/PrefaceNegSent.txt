NEGATIVE SENTIMENT: The text is filled with negative sentiment and emotions

The following texts have different degrees of negative sentiment and emotions. Rate them to indicate the degree.  

Sentiment refers to positive or negative opinion towards something. Emotion relates to feelings--happiness, sadness, anger, embarrassment etc. For this task, indicate the extent to which the text is filled with negative sentiment and negative emotions. For an example, a heated debate arguing for gun control could have a lot of negative sentiment. On the other hand, an article about vacations and holidays could have a lot of positive sentiment and will receive a low rating for negative sentiment. Also, when an article has no sentiment/emotions (for example, a chapter from a high school science textbook is likely to have little sentiment and emotion), give it a low rating for negative sentiment.
