Don't Get Stung: Outsmarting The Mosquito

It's the season of the whine -- the high-pitched note that signals a prowling mosquito near your ear, and the even more annoying complaints emitted by humans wondering whether mosquitoes really should have a place in the web of life.
It's also the season of gadgets and sprays. The pressure to defeat the ubiquitous little bloodsuckers is greater than ever, since mosquitoes may carry West Nile virus or Eastern equine encephalitis, as well as cause the familiar red, itchy bumps. Also, mosquitoes breed in standing water, and at least in the Northeast, a wet spring is producing a bumper crop.
A vast arsenal is available for the mosquitophobe. A partial list includes Mosquito Deleto, the Electronic Swatter, Mosquito PowerTrap, Mosquito Terminator, Mosquito Magnet, the Bug Zapper, Mosquito Control Plus, the Solar Mosquito Guard, the Dragonfly Mosquito System, Mosquito 'Cognito, the Sonic Web and Insectivoro. Limited space makes it impractical to list every flowering of the American bug-killing imagination.
Apart from gadgets, there are citronella candles, sprays and lotions galore, synthetic and natural, and clothing impregnated with permethrin. For anyone with a taste for the primitive a full body coat of bear fat or axle grease will discourage both insects and unwanted suitors. So many choices: what's a poor bipedal blood meal to do?
Joseph Conlon has some thoughts on the matter. He is an ex-Navy entomologist who has solved numerous mosquito-related problems, like weaning the Marine Corps from Skin So Soft in the days before it added a new chemical repellent.
He is now the technical adviser to the American Mosquito Control Association and is more than willing to offer advice on mosquito defense. He favors simple, direct action, and is blunt about some of the devices sold widely. ''Don't be taken in by a lot of newfangled gadgets,'' he said.
Instead, he says, you should first ''know your enemy.'' For example, he says he gets calls from homeowners who say, ''I've got these big mosquitoes that are bothering my kids.'' They're actually crane flies, he said, which look like giant mosquitoes but don't sting or bite.
Second, eliminate breeding sources. In other words, depending on the neighborhood you live in, either get rid of the old tires on your front lawn or make sure water isn't accumulating in your terra cotta garden ornaments. For ornamental pools, fish help, or there are chemicals that kill the larvae in water.
Fix your screens, make sure the bugs aren't getting in the house through air conditioners and consider the ultimate sacrifice: stay inside at dusk and early morning when the mosquitoes are most active. If you must go out to greet the dawn use insect repellents and wear loose-fitting clothing.
Mr. Conlon was not favorably disposed toward devices that use light to attract and electricity to fry insects. ''These things are worthless,'' he said. ''Actually they're worse than useless.'' They kill mostly larger, beneficial insects.
An often quoted study by Dr. Douglas W. Tallamy of the University of Delaware found that less than a quarter of a percent of insects killed by such a zapper were mosquitoes and at least 13 percent were beneficial insects. Zappers have undergone some changes, however, and some now use chemicals known to be effective at attracting mosquitoes.
Bats and purple martins are not much better than zappers, Mr. Conlon said. They do eat some mosquitoes, but prefer bigger juicier meals. Anti-mosquito plants are effective at keeping mosquitoes away from themselves, but they won't help you much, he said. And those sonic devices to repel mosquitoes? Tests had shown ''no repellency whatsoever,'' Mr. Conlon said.
Dr. Tallamy concurred. He had not researched them himself, but said, ''there's no physiological basis for them to work, and I've seen no evidence from any study that they work.'' Some frequencies of sound may, however, attract mosquitoes.
There are devices that clearly do lure and kill mosquitoes, although that doesn't mean they'll keep you from getting bitten. Among these are traps that use carbon dioxide and other chemicals to attract mosquitoes, which are then killed by various means, like being trapped until they die of dehydration. Carbon dioxide makes a mosquito think of the warm exhalations of a person relaxing with a book in a hammock, and they follow it. Other chemicals are known to attract them.
''The technology behind these and the theory behind these is really solid,'' Mr. Conlon said. But, how helpful they are in preventing bites depends on the situation. On isolated barrier islands they proved effective in reducing mosquito population. ''In a subdivision they're not going to work as well,'' he said, because the neighborhood will provide a constant new supply.
Dr. Daniel L. Kline, a research entomologist at the Department of Agriculture Center for Medical, Agricultural and Veterinary Entomology in Gainesville, Fla., said the CO2  traps showed promise, but agreed that their effectiveness in the typical suburban yard was unknown. The question is how many mosquitoes you have. If you live near a salt marsh, using one trap would be like trying to empty the ocean with a cup.
Citronella coils and candles are weakly repellent, Mr. Conlon said, but a cloud of smoke from a smudge pot or a cigar will work, if you're willing to let it surround you.
Beyond clearing standing water, navigating the commercial minefield of mosquito gadgets, and staying inside, looms the prospect of protecting your person. Let's say you must venture into the yard, or perhaps you are planning to walk through a swamp in August, or you're a soldier and are being sent to an unpleasant location.
Again, Mr. Conlon does not mince words: ''DEET is still king.'' DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is the active ingredient in most commercial insect repellents. A variety of other substances, natural and synthetic, have some repellent effect, but DEET, said Mr. Conlon, is so far the best. That doesn't mean, however, that you need high concentrations. A 25 to 35 percent concentration is best, he said, the higher concentrations don't provide much added benefit, but simply extend the time of effectiveness.
A report last year in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded that DEET was by far the most effective. The authors were Dr. Mark S. Fradin, a Chapel Hill, N.C., physician, and Dr. John F. Day, a medical entomologist at the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory.
They reported that a 28 percent solution of DEET offered complete protection for about five hours. A ''soybean-oil-based repellent'' worked for about an hour and a half, a formula with a relatively new chemical repellent IR3535 for about 20 minutes, and all other botanical repellents for less than 20 minutes. ''Repellent-impregnated wristbands offered no protection.''
Avon, which has added the repellent IR3535 to its popular lotion, Skin So Soft, rejected the findings of the journal article, saying that laboratory studies are not as effective as field studies.
Although many consumers worry about health effects of insect repellents, the Environmental Protection Agency has declared normal use of DEET products to pose no significant risks for children or adults.
The American Academy of Pediatricians, a private group, takes positions on a variety of health issues that affect children, including the use of DEET. Its most recent advisory suggests that DEET is appropriate for use on children when there is a concern about insect-borne diseases, although children are much less likely than adults to become ill from West Nile virus.
The academy recommends 30 percent as a maximum concentration and suggests using the lowest concentration that will last for the time spent outdoors. Products with 10 percent are effective for about two hours.
The academy's advisory urges parents not to apply DEET more than once a day, also good advice for adults, and not to use a product that combines DEET with a sunscreen.
Some new products may be on the horizon. A new class of repellent, called SS-220, has been patented by scientists working for the Department of Agriculture and is now undergoing toxicity tests.
Dr. Kline's lab is investigating why mosquitoes find some people more attractive than others. There is definitely ''scientific merit,'' he said, to the observations that one family member tends to draw mosquitoes.
Dr. Kline said a colleague at his lab, Dr. Ulrich Bernier, had patented several chemicals given off by unappetizing humans that seem to serve as masking chemicals or inhibitors. Any application of this research would be some way down the line.
A method of personal protection widely used in the military and now sold to consumers is clothing treated with permethrin, an effective insecticide that shouldn't be applied to the skin. With the clothing, you still need to apply a repellent to exposed skin. The Army has other good advice, which everyone should follow. Do not wear dog and cat flea collars, not even on your legs, no matter how bad the bugs are. A June bulletin on pest management from the Army warns against wearing flea and tick collars. ''Animal flea and tick collars are NOT for human use!'' the warning states.
The reason is simple. Dogs and cats don't sweat, but people do. And sweat can release some of the pesticides from the collars so they can be absorbed by the skin.
The precautions the military takes can also be grim. Mr. Conlon recalled that one problem he solved in his military career involved marine recruits at Parris Island, S.C., who were being eaten alive when they assembled at 5:30 a.m.
That, of course, was prime mosquito time. The solution was simple. Move the time up an hour, and have the recruits fall in at 4:30 a.m. After all, why should marines let some insects get a jump on them?
