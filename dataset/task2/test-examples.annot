	How Quantum Physics Can Teach Biologists About Evolution


In the fall of 1900, a young German physicist, Max Planck, began making calculations about the glow emitted by objects heated to high temperature. In retrospect, it seems like a small-bore problem, just the task to give a young scientist at the beginning of his career.

But if the question sounds minor, Planck's answer was not. His work led him to discover a new world, the bizarre realm of quantum mechanics, where matter is both a particle and a wave and where the predictable stability of Newton gives way to probabilistic uncertainty.

As Dennis Overbye of The New York Times once put it in these pages, Planck had grasped ''a loose thread that when tugged would eventually unravel the entire fabric of what had passed for reality.''

Physicists reeled. But physics survived. And once they got over their shock, scientists began testing Planck's ideas with observation and experiment, work that eventually produced computer chips, lasers, CAT scans and a host of other useful technologies -- all made possible through our new understanding of the way the world works.

Biologists might do well to keep Planck in mind as they confront creationism and ''intelligent design'' and battle to preserve the teaching of evolution in public schools.

Usually, when confronting the opponents of evolution, biologists make the case that evolution should be taught because it is true.

They cite radiocarbon dating to show that Earth is billions of years old, not a few thousand years old, as some creationists would have it. Biologists cite research on microbes, or the eye, or the biology of the cell to shoot down arguments that life is so ''irreducibly complex'' that only a supernatural force or agent could have called it into being, as intelligent designers would have it.

And when scientists named Steve (hundreds of them by now) decided to advance the cause of evolution in the classroom and honor the evolutionary theorist Stephen Jay Gould by forming ''Project Steve,'' the T-shirts they printed said in part, ''Evolution is a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences, and the scientific evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the idea that all living things share a common ancestry.''

The battling biologists are right. But someone uneducated in the scientific method who listens to the arguments over evolution could be forgiven for thinking that they boil down to ''my theory is better than your theory,'' with both sides preaching with theological fervor.

Scientists don't talk often enough or loud enough about the real strength of evolution -- not that it is correct, but that it meets the definition of science.

It's not that they ignore the idea -- the National Center for Science Education, sponsor of Project Steve, makes the point on its Web site, and organizations like the American Association for the Advancement of Science do, too. But biologists do not emphasize it as they might.

Science looks to explain nature through nature (the works of God rather than the words of God, as Darwin himself is said to have put it), and its predictions can be tested by observation and experimentation.

Scientists form hypotheses, devise ways to test them, analyze the data that they collect and then decide whether the results support or undermine their hypotheses.

This process has produced centuries of useful knowledge and fascinating discovery.

But it is messy, a mixed-up dance of two steps forward, one step back; dud ideas; blind alleys; and things that turn out to be not exactly what they seemed.

So it is hardly surprising that in the decades since Darwin developed the ideas he outlined in ''The Origin of Species,'' other biologists have suggested modifications or new ideas about this or that aspect of his great idea. Still other researchers, making their own observations or conducting other experiments, have refuted them or tried to.

For example, biologists argue about the degree to which evolution moves smoothly or progresses in fits and starts, a Gould-ian theory called punctuated equilibrium. This intellectual turmoil is not evidence of the weakness of the evolutionary thinking, as some critics have said. It is proof of the robustness of the scientific method.

And if this messy process were to produce an alternative to evolution that better explains nature and better meets the tests of experiment and observation, biologists would have to revise their ideas or even scrap them.

That would be a stunning shock, comparable to the shock that swept physics in the post-Planck decades of the 20th century. But biology would deal with it. And whoever initiated this shock would be at least as big a figure in biology as Planck is in physics.

''The supposed 'data contradicting evolution' do not exist,'' a Steve, Dr. Steve Rissing, a biologist at Ohio State University, said in an e-mail message.

But if they did, Dr. Rissing added, ''I sure would want to be the scientist publishing them. Think of it -- the covers of Nature and Science, and Newsweek and Time, too!''

It is evolution's acceptance of nature as the only true scientific authority and its capacity to fall in the face of a more effective explanation that make evolution science, far more than its mere correctness.

That is the difficulty faced by advocates of creationism and intelligent design. It is possible to believe in evolution and believe in God. Plenty of biologists do. But their deity is not a creator or intelligent agent at work in the material world in ways that transcend nature and its laws. That would be a matter of faith, not science.

ESSAY

Correction:  July 12, 2005, Tuesday  An essay in Science Times on July 5 about the resilience of evolutionary theory referred incorrectly to the method used by scientists to determine that the Earth is billions of years old. It is radioisotope dating, using elements like uranium, not carbon.

	Show Me the Science


PRESIDENT BUSH, announcing this month that he was in favor of teaching about ''intelligent design'' in the schools, said, ''I think that part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought.'' A couple of weeks later, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Republican leader, made the same point. Teaching both intelligent design and evolution ''doesn't force any particular theory on anyone,'' Mr. Frist said. ''I think in a pluralistic society that is the fairest way to go about education and training people for the future.''

Is ''intelligent design'' a legitimate school of scientific thought? Is there something to it, or have these people been taken in by one of the most ingenious hoaxes in the history of science? Wouldn't such a hoax be impossible? No. Here's how it has been done.

First, imagine how easy it would be for a determined band of naysayers to shake the world's confidence in quantum physics -- how weird it is! -- or Einsteinian relativity. In spite of a century of instruction and popularization by physicists, few people ever really get their heads around the concepts involved. Most people eventually cobble together a justification for accepting the assurances of the experts: ''Well, they pretty much agree with one another, and they claim that it is their understanding of these strange topics that allows them to harness atomic energy, and to make transistors and lasers, which certainly do work''

Fortunately for physicists, there is no powerful motivation for such a band of mischief-makers to form. They don't have to spend much time persuading people that quantum physics and Einsteinian relativity really have been established beyond all reasonable doubt.

With evolution, however, it is different. The fundamental scientific idea of evolution by natural selection is not just mind-boggling; natural selection, by executing God's traditional task of designing and creating all creatures great and small, also seems to deny one of the best reasons we have for believing in God. So there is plenty of motivation for resisting the assurances of the biologists. Nobody is immune to wishful thinking. It takes scientific discipline to protect ourselves from our own credulity, but we've also found ingenious ways to fool ourselves and others. Some of the methods used to exploit these urges are easy to analyze; others take a little more unpacking.

A creationist pamphlet sent to me some years ago had an amusing page in it, purporting to be part of a simple questionnaire:

Test Two

Do you know of any building that didn't have a builder? [YES] [NO]

Do you know of any painting that didn't have a painter? [YES] [NO]

Do you know of any car that didn't have a maker? [YES] [NO]

If you answered YES for any of the above, give details:

Take that, you Darwinians! The presumed embarrassment of the test-taker when faced with this task perfectly expresses the incredulity many people feel when they confront Darwin's great idea. It seems obvious, doesn't it, that there couldn't be any designs without designers, any such creations without a creator.

Well, yes -- until you look at what contemporary biology has demonstrated beyond all reasonable doubt: that natural selection -- the process in which reproducing entities must compete for finite resources and thereby engage in a tournament of blind trial and error from which improvements automatically emerge -- has the power to generate breathtakingly ingenious designs.

Take the development of the eye, which has been one of the favorite challenges of creationists. How on earth, they ask, could that engineering marvel be produced by a series of small, unplanned steps? Only an intelligent designer could have created such a brilliant arrangement of a shape-shifting lens, an aperture-adjusting iris, a light-sensitive image surface of exquisite sensitivity, all housed in a sphere that can shift its aim in a hundredth of a second and send megabytes of information to the visual cortex every second for years on end.

But as we learn more and more about the history of the genes involved, and how they work -- all the way back to their predecessor genes in the sightless bacteria from which multicelled animals evolved more than a half-billion years ago -- we can begin to tell the story of how photosensitive spots gradually turned into light-sensitive craters that could detect the rough direction from which light came, and then gradually acquired their lenses, improving their information-gathering capacities all the while.

We can't yet say what all the details of this process were, but real eyes representative of all the intermediate stages can be found, dotted around the animal kingdom, and we have detailed computer models to demonstrate that the creative process works just as the theory says.

All it takes is a rare accident that gives one lucky animal a mutation that improves its vision over that of its siblings; if this helps it have more offspring than its rivals, this gives evolution an opportunity to raise the bar and ratchet up the design of the eye by one mindless step. And since these lucky improvements accumulate -- this was Darwin's insight -- eyes can automatically get better and better and better, without any intelligent designer.

Brilliant as the design of the eye is, it betrays its origin with a tell-tale flaw: the retina is inside out. The nerve fibers that carry the signals from the eye's rods and cones (which sense light and color) lie on top of them, and have to plunge through a large hole in the retina to get to the brain, creating the blind spot. No intelligent designer would put such a clumsy arrangement in a camcorder, and this is just one of hundreds of accidents frozen in evolutionary history that confirm the mindlessness of the historical process.

If you still find Test Two compelling, a sort of cognitive illusion that you can feel even as you discount it, you are like just about everybody else in the world; the idea that natural selection has the power to generate such sophisticated designs is deeply counterintuitive. Francis Crick, one of the discoverers of DNA, once jokingly credited his colleague Leslie Orgel with ''Orgel's Second Rule'': Evolution is cleverer than you are. Evolutionary biologists are often startled by the power of natural selection to ''discover'' an ''ingenious'' solution to a design problem posed in the lab.

This observation lets us address a slightly more sophisticated version of the cognitive illusion presented by Test Two. When evolutionists like Crick marvel at the cleverness of the process of natural selection they are not acknowledging intelligent design. The designs found in nature are nothing short of brilliant, but the process of design that generates them is utterly lacking in intelligence of its own.

Intelligent design advocates, however, exploit the ambiguity between process and product that is built into the word ''design.'' For them, the presence of a finished product (a fully evolved eye, for instance) is evidence of an intelligent design process. But this tempting conclusion is just what evolutionary biology has shown to be mistaken.

Yes, eyes are for seeing, but these and all the other purposes in the natural world can be generated by processes that are themselves without purposes and without intelligence. This is hard to understand, but so is the idea that colored objects in the world are composed of atoms that are not themselves colored, and that heat is not made of tiny hot things.

The focus on intelligent design has, paradoxically, obscured something else: genuine scientific controversies about evolution that abound. In just about every field there are challenges to one established theory or another. The legitimate way to stir up such a storm is to come up with an alternative theory that makes a prediction that is crisply denied by the reigning theory -- but that turns out to be true, or that explains something that has been baffling defenders of the status quo, or that unifies two distant theories at the cost of some element of the currently accepted view.

To date, the proponents of intelligent design have not produced anything like that. No experiments with results that challenge any mainstream biological understanding. No observations from the fossil record or genomics or biogeography or comparative anatomy that undermine standard evolutionary thinking.

Instead, the proponents of intelligent design use a ploy that works something like this. First you misuse or misdescribe some scientist's work. Then you get an angry rebuttal. Then, instead of dealing forthrightly with the charges leveled, you cite the rebuttal as evidence that there is a ''controversy'' to teach.

Note that the trick is content-free. You can use it on any topic. ''Smith's work in geology supports my argument that the earth is flat,'' you say, misrepresenting Smith's work. When Smith responds with a denunciation of your misuse of her work, you respond, saying something like: ''See what a controversy we have here? Professor Smith and I are locked in a titanic scientific debate. We should teach the controversy in the classrooms.'' And here is the delicious part: you can often exploit the very technicality of the issues to your own advantage, counting on most of us to miss the point in all the difficult details.

William Dembski, one of the most vocal supporters of intelligent design, notes that he provoked Thomas Schneider, a biologist, into a response that Dr. Dembski characterizes as ''some hair-splitting that could only look ridiculous to outsider observers.'' What looks to scientists -- and is -- a knockout objection by Dr. Schneider is portrayed to most everyone else as ridiculous hair-splitting.

In short, no science. Indeed, no intelligent design hypothesis has even been ventured as a rival explanation of any biological phenomenon. This might seem surprising to people who think that intelligent design competes directly with the hypothesis of non-intelligent design by natural selection. But saying, as intelligent design proponents do, ''You haven't explained everything yet,'' is not a competing hypothesis. Evolutionary biology certainly hasn't explained everything that perplexes biologists. But intelligent design hasn't yet tried to explain anything.

To formulate a competing hypothesis, you have to get down in the trenches and offer details that have testable implications. So far, intelligent design proponents have conveniently sidestepped that requirement, claiming that they have no specifics in mind about who or what the intelligent designer might be.

To see this shortcoming in relief, consider an imaginary hypothesis of intelligent design that could explain the emergence of human beings on this planet:

About six million years ago, intelligent genetic engineers from another galaxy visited Earth and decided that it would be a more interesting planet if there was a language-using, religion-forming species on it, so they sequestered some primates and genetically re-engineered them to give them the language instinct, and enlarged frontal lobes for planning and reflection. It worked.

If some version of this hypothesis were true, it could explain how and why human beings differ from their nearest relatives, and it would disconfirm the competing evolutionary hypotheses that are being pursued.

We'd still have the problem of how these intelligent genetic engineers came to exist on their home planet, but we can safely ignore that complication for the time being, since there is not the slightest shred of evidence in favor of this hypothesis.

But here is something the intelligent design community is reluctant to discuss: no other intelligent-design hypothesis has anything more going for it. In fact, my farfetched hypothesis has the advantage of being testable in principle: we could compare the human and chimpanzee genomes, looking for unmistakable signs of tampering by these genetic engineers from another galaxy. Finding some sort of user's manual neatly embedded in the apparently functionless ''junk DNA'' that makes up most of the human genome would be a Nobel Prize-winning coup for the intelligent design gang, but if they are looking at all, they haven't come up with anything to report.

It's worth pointing out that there are plenty of substantive scientific controversies in biology that are not yet in the textbooks or the classrooms. The scientific participants in these arguments vie for acceptance among the relevant expert communities in peer-reviewed journals, and the writers and editors of textbooks grapple with judgments about which findings have risen to the level of acceptance -- not yet truth -- to make them worth serious consideration by undergraduates and high school students.

SO get in line, intelligent designers. Get in line behind the hypothesis that life started on Mars and was blown here by a cosmic impact. Get in line behind the aquatic ape hypothesis, the gestural origin of language hypothesis and the theory that singing came before language, to mention just a few of the enticing hypotheses that are actively defended but still insufficiently supported by hard facts.

The Discovery Institute, the conservative organization that has helped to put intelligent design on the map, complains that its members face hostility from the established scientific journals. But establishment hostility is not the real hurdle to intelligent design. If intelligent design were a scientific idea whose time had come, young scientists would be dashing around their labs, vying to win the Nobel Prizes that surely are in store for anybody who can overturn any significant proposition of contemporary evolutionary biology.

Remember cold fusion? The establishment was incredibly hostile to that hypothesis, but scientists around the world rushed to their labs in the effort to explore the idea, in hopes of sharing in the glory if it turned out to be true.

Instead of spending more than $1 million a year on publishing books and articles for non-scientists and on other public relations efforts, the Discovery Institute should finance its own peer-reviewed electronic journal. This way, the organization could live up to its self-professed image: the doughty defenders of brave iconoclasts bucking the establishment.

For now, though, the theory they are promoting is exactly what George Gilder, a long-time affiliate of the Discovery Institute, has said it is: ''Intelligent design itself does not have any content.''

Since there is no content, there is no ''controversy'' to teach about in biology class. But here is a good topic for a high school course on current events and politics: Is intelligent design a hoax? And if so, how was it perpetrat-ed?

Op-Ed Contributor Daniel C. Dennett, a professor of philosophy at Tufts University, is the author of ''Freedom Evolves'' and ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea.''

	RYAN HOWARD, NO ASTERISK


What would it feel like to inhabit the role that so many have auditioned for across the decades, on ballfields in all 50 states and beyond? Back foot dug into the batter's box, the grip on the bat firm but relaxed. The baseball approaches as if in slow motion, and you start your swing with a short stride, a subtle shift of weight and a powerful forward thrust of the hips. Your hands follow and then, finally, the barrel of the bat comes whipping through the hitting zone and -- crack! -- connects with the ball, sending it on a majestic arc into the upper deck.

Just once, right? To be that most American of sports icons: the Slugger.

Now, here is Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies on Sept. 3, 2006. He is a baby in baseball years, still in his first full big-league season, but a man-child at the plate: 6-foot-4, 250-plus pounds and big all over. He has biceps that it would take two large hands to fully encircle, thick-muscled forearms and -- more noticeable in the locker room than on the field, where he wears a baggy uniform top -- a surprisingly ample midsection. Howard is Ruthian, only bigger. Even his round, expressive face -- quick to break into a smile, more open and inviting than the typical impassive countenance of the big-time pro athlete -- seems extra large.

He takes his place in the left batter's box at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, a hitter's paradise -- not that the dimensions of a ballpark matter much to him. Legend has it that Howard hit his first 400-foot home run at age 12, a blast that rocketed over an outfield fence and smacked against the side of a Red Lobster restaurant.

On this Sunday afternoon, the opposing pitcher is Tim Hudson of the Atlanta Braves, a veteran with stuff that is more clever than overpowering. Hudson's pitches have what is called late movement -- they sink, dart and sail, leaving hitters waving at air or topping harmless ground balls.

Howard, batting cleanup, leads off the bottom of the second inning. He has, at this point, 49 home runs, an astonishing number for early September. He has already surpassed the team record for home runs in a season, held by Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt, and he is two away from Ralph Kiner's mark for second-year players, set in 1947. (Howard became a full-time big leaguer in July 2005.)

The act of hitting a baseball is an energy transfer: from the body to the bat to the ball. Just before Hudson rocks into his wind-up, Howard, a lefty, uses his right hand to point his 34-ounce bat at a 45-degree angle directly over the pitcher's head. This is a timing device, although, as Howard has become one of the game's most prodigious home-run hitters, it can easily be taken as a boast. Follow the angle of the bat and it suggests a trajectory straight out over the center-field fence.

He brings the bat back as Hudson readies, grips it with both hands and cocks his left (back) elbow. His focus now is on ''staying quiet,'' as he puts it -- being still. He wants no energy to leak out until it can be put to its proper use. His knees are flexed, his weight set back in his stance. Only his wrists are moving, just slightly, causing the top of the bat to wave like a flag in a limp breeze.

The first pitch is a slider, bearing in on Howard's shoe tops. He explodes out of his stance and brings the barrel of the bat down solidly on the ball -- sending a towering drive over the right-center-field wall. Home run No. 50.

Hudson stands at the back of the mound and looks toward the outfield long after the ball has cleared the wall. He stares at the replay on the scoreboard, as if thinking to himself, He hit that pitch where?

Second at-bat: Hudson throws his first pitch near Howard's head, which he casually avoids by leaning back. ''No big deal,'' Howard tells me later. ''You kind of have to expect that.'' After a foul ball, he sends Hudson's third offering -- a fat pitch about belt high -- deep over the center-field wall, in the same general direction as the first one, only quite a bit farther. Home run No. 51.

Third at-bat: With the count at one ball and two strikes Hudson throws a sinker that veers low and away, a pitch that is meant to tempt Howard to swing at something he can't reach -- or, if he does, can't hit solidly. Howard extends his massive arms and hits a line drive to left field, which clears the wall nearly as quickly as a spectator can locate it with his eyes. Home run No. 52.

Three at-bats. Three home runs.

Out on the mound, Hudson looks more bemused than angry. He had put that last pitch right where he intended. ''You kind of scratch your head after that,'' he tells reporters gathered at his locker after the game. ''What the hell are you going to do next?''

Ryan Howard felt a surge of pleasure when he connected on those three swings. He heard the crowd's roar, knew for sure that the second two balls would clear the outfield walls. (The first just cleared the fence, and Howard had taken off hard toward first base out of the batter's box.) But there was a lack of actual physical sensation, or at least one that is easily described -- that weird nothingness of hitting a ball, with force and perfect timing, right on the sweet spot of a baseball bat.

It is an odd neurological loop: job well done, but you know it only because there's no unpleasant message to the contrary. ''You feel a lot more in your hands if the pitch gets in on you and busts you in the handle,'' Howard says. ''It stings. But when you catch it square, it doesn't seem like you feel it as much.''

Last season, Howard had 58 home runs, a total exceeded by only five men in baseball history -- Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Roger Maris and Babe Ruth. Twenty-eight of Howard's home runs either tied the game or put the Phillies ahead, and he knocked in a major-league-leading 149 runs -- including 42 in August, the most r.b.i. by a player in a single month in 34 years. He was the National League player of the month in both August and September, and after the season, he was voted the league's Most Valuable Player.

As every baseball fan knows, the game is awash in statistics, some more telling than others. One esoteric stat is particularly enlightening in Howard's case: his home-run-to-fly-ball ratio of 39.5 percent. What that means is that of every 10 fair balls he hits in the air, about 4 end up as home runs. The player with the next highest ratio last year, Travis Hafner of the Cleveland Indians, had a ratio of 30.2.

There is a feast-or-famine aspect to Howard's hitting: he strikes out a lot -- 181 times last season, the second most in the majors -- so he doesn't put as many balls in play as others do in the same number of at-bats. But as his teammate Aaron Rowand says: ''When he hits it, he hits it. Ryan doesn't hit a lot of bloopers.''

The majority of Howard's home runs went to left or center field, the mark of a hitter who is powerful enough not to have to pull balls to reach the seats, and several landed in places rarely reached by batted balls. Last April in Philadelphia, Howard hit a dead-center-field home run that was measured at 496 feet.

It is impossible, of course, to think about power hitting these days without wondering about performance-enhancing drugs. Bonds, McGwire and Sosa all played in what is now commonly called baseball's Steroid Era, and suspicion has fallen on each of them. On the subject of sports and chemical enhancement, the first rule is never to assume guilt -- or innocence. Surprises lurk. But Howard, big from the womb, a lifelong slugger, is generally assumed around baseball to be clean. (Howard is subject to Major League Baseball's drug-testing policy, which calls for players to be tested for steroids, amphetamines and certain other substances once in spring training and at least one other time during the season. He was also tested in the minor leagues.)

In mid-September, a ball hit by Howard at Minute Maid Park in Houston caromed off the glove of a 10-year-old fan in the left-field seats and fell back into the outfield. Television replays clearly showed that it should have been called a home run, but the third-base umpire ruled the ball in play. After the game, Astros first baseman Lance Berkman had an interesting reaction, telling reporters, ''I hope it doesn't cost him the steroid-free home run record.''

It didn't. Howard would have fallen short of Maris's 61 home runs, anyway -- mainly because he became so terrifying to opposing managers that they started walking him at every possible opportunity. He was second in the majors with 37 intentional walks, several of them issued in situations that rarely call for such a move.

For example, in a late-September game, Frank Robinson, then managing the Washington Nationals, twice ordered Howard to be walked in extra innings -- once with the bases empty and two outs, another time with a runner on first who then moved into scoring position as a potential game-winning run. After a game the night before, during which Robinson challenged Howard in a key spot, Robinson told me: ''Every hitter has vulnerabilities. No reason not to attack them.'' When I asked him the next night why he seemed to lose courage, he said: ''Didn't want to press my luck. Ryan is a very strong young man.''

Physicists who have studied hitting toss around terms like ''bat speed,'' ''torque'' and ''rotational mechanics.'' It is fair to say that strength generally promotes bat speed and home-run power. Howard comes from a family of big people and, by appearance, is what used to be called ''country strong.''

Howard and I met one day near his off-season home, in suburban St. Louis, amid a landscape of tract houses and what looked like an endless expanse of strip shopping centers and chain restaurants. He had just finished one of his three-hour, five-times-a-week workouts, which consist mostly of weight training. He had been dieting, too, eating more vegetables and fewer fried foods.

We took a seat at the restaurant he chose, a place called O'Charley's, which featured an oversize menu of American favorites. When his grilled chicken was put down in front of him, he looked displeased and immediately lifted it with his fork. ''I sure hope they put my mashed potatoes under there,'' he said. When he came upon a mound of them, he brightened up. He continued stabbing at a bowl of tortilla chips, loading them up with salsa. ''Do me a favor,'' he told me. ''Eat some of these. Help me out. I'm trying to be good.''

Howard's power surge at the end of last season brought about something unprecedented in recent baseball history. By July, the Phillies had surrendered the season -- and sort of the next one, too. The general manager, Pat Gillick, had traded off important players -- the starting right fielder and third baseman, a starting pitcher, a key left-handed relief pitcher -- and told the team's fans not to expect the Phillies to be contenders until 2008. Such housecleaning happens every season in baseball: lesser teams build for the future by trading veterans for prospects.

What doesn't happen is what the Phillies did next, which was to climb back into the playoff race, largely on the back of Howard, who in the season's second half hit .355 with 30 home runs and 78 r.b.i. By August, Gillick had reversed course and was acquiring veteran talent for the stretch run. (The Phillies were finally eliminated from the wild-card playoff spot on the last weekend of the season.)

Howard, respectful of baseball custom, strives for modesty. Understatement is a much-admired quality in baseball. When I talked to him about the home-run-to-fly-ball ratio, he had no idea what his was (or that anyone even kept such a stat). But when I asked him to guess how many of his fly balls cleared the fences, his answer seemed like a true measure of his estimation of his own abilities. ''I don't know,'' he said. ''Six out of 10? Seven out of 10?''

In some ways, Howard is the anti-Barry Bonds, who looms over the coming baseball season like an unwelcome guest at a dinner party. Bonds, an outfielder with the San Francisco Giants, is 22 home runs from surpassing Hank Aaron's record of 755. For a great many baseball fans, his grim pursuit will be a cause for dismay more than celebration. Even before the steroid allegations, Bonds was one of the game's sour personalities, unloved by fans outside his home city and often reviled by his own teammates.

Howard, by contrast, is cordial with the press, well liked in the clubhouse and much more likely to offer fans a smile and an autograph than a scowl. He arrives early for games and can usually be found with his big frame folded into an easy chair or couch in front of a large TV, watching videos with teammates. He gets high marks for his ''demeanor.'' Baseball people use the word constantly, and it serves as a catchall for many things: a player's work habits; his ability to stay on a steady emotional keel whether he has hit a couple of home runs or struck out four times; his relationships among teammates and coaches.

''Ryan is just a very easy guy to be around,'' the Phillies' manager, Charlie Manuel, says. ''You couldn't ask for a guy with a better demeanor.''

Howard, though, does share one similarity with Bonds, a significant one within the context of baseball's changing sociology: he is an African-American player at a moment when the number of American-born blacks in the major leagues has dropped strikingly. In 2005, the National League champion Houston Astros had no black players on their World Series roster, the first time that was the case for a team in half a century. At one point last season, six teams in Major League Baseball did not have a single black player on their rosters. Below the professional level, there are so few blacks in the game that many of the nation's historically black colleges are fielding baseball teams made up mostly of white and Hispanic players. (The Washington Post reported that Coppin State University in Baltimore had 30 white male students enrolled in 2006; roughly half of them were on the baseball team.)

Black players now make up about 9 percent of big-league rosters -- down from 19 percent in 1995 and 25 percent in 1975. Hispanics, at 29 percent, have become the dominant minority in the game.

So how did Ryan Howard become a baseball player? Part of the answer is that he comes from where many of the game's white players do -- a largely white suburb. He grew up in Wildwood, Mo., on the outer edge of St. Louis's western sprawl. His mother, Cheryl, now retired, worked in marketing, and his father, Ron, is a manager for I.B.M. He has three siblings, including a fraternal twin, all of whom are college-educated professionals.

Ron and Cheryl Howard don't consider themselves particularly athletic. ''I could play everything, just not well,'' Ron told me. Cheryl Howard added: ''I'm from the pre-Title IX days, so I didn't get a chance to play organized sports. But my father played sandlot baseball with Willie Mays in Birmingham, so we've decided Ryan's baseball talent comes through my side.''

When Ryan Howard was 2, his father walked into a room where a TV was showing a baseball game and saw his son intent on the action and swinging a little red bat. ''It was such a natural swing,'' Ron Howard says. ''At that moment I knew he'd be some kind of baseball player. How far? I didn't know. But that feeling came over me.''

To be blessed with hand-eye coordination and the strength to mash a baseball 500 feet ought to fill a man with self-assurance. But pro sports are full of gifted players with cracks in their psyches who on some career-killing level do not fully believe in themselves. Howard's upbringing seems to have imbued him with a sense of self that extends well beyond his abilities on the ball field.

As his parents describe it, their household was a mix of old-time Southern values and middle-class aspiration. ''All our kids were taught to say 'Yes, sir,' 'Yes, ma'am' and so on,'' Ron Howard says. ''We valued hard work and taught them: believe in oneself, believe in each other and believe in the Almighty.''

There were, as well, some quirkier rules. For example, Ron taught everyone to drive using a standard shift, which he considers an essential life skill, and made them take their driving tests in a car with a stick shift. ''No, they weren't pleased about it,'' he recalls, ''but it was a binary situation. You do it this way if you want to drive -- or the other way if you don't want to drive.''

Howard played a lot of soccer as a kid. He was a good high school basketball player. He also played the trombone in the school band. He played a little football, but his mother insisted he give it up because she believed he risked injury by being such a large target.

Ryan Howard says that he was one of just a handful of black players on most of his youth baseball teams. His sports heroes were Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey Jr., Tony Gwynn. ''I guess you can throw Michael in there,'' he adds, meaning Michael Jordan, but he makes it sound like an obligation. He was focused on baseball.

In Philadelphia, Howard faces the particular challenge of playing for a team with famously demanding (and sometimes abusive) fans -- and in a city with a particularly shameful history of mistreating black baseball players. The Phillies were the last team in the National League to sign a black player -- in 1957, a full decade after Jackie Robinson's debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Robinson himself suffered such abuse from the Phillies that he later wrote that they were ''a Northern team that I had come to associate with the Deep South.''

Other than Howard, the Phillies have had just one black superstar: Dick Allen, then known as ''Richie,'' a fearsome slugger but a rebel and a turbulent soul who endured such mind-bending abuse from the home crowd that after six years in Philadelphia he was scratching cryptic messages with his spikes in the infield dirt. (Among them, ''Mom,'' ''Boo'' and ''Oct. 2,'' the date of the last game of the 1969 season.)

Sometimes, though, a certain athlete and a city just seem like a good match. Howard drives a GMC Yukon with 100,000-plus miles and is not much for fancy clothes or late nights. His Everyman persona has appeal in a city where even white-collar, well-heeled season-ticket holders are apt to describe themselves as blue-collar fans. During the season, he lives in a condominium in South Philadelphia not far from the ballpark.

''I'm cool with everybody,'' says Howard, who is single and has a 6-year-old son from a former relationship. ''The fans have been nothing but nice to me. I'll walk around the city and people will come up to me and say 'Hi' or 'Keep up the good work' or whatever, and I'll stop and talk to them.''

Baseball is the most hidebound of American sports. It manufactures and honors tradition, myth and superstition. And it probably also has a greater share of ignorance than other sports. The entire movement toward once-obscure and newly developed statistics, after all -- begun by Bill James and others, some of them now in the employ of big-league teams -- came about because professional baseball people drew erroneous conclusions from the same old numbers they loved so much.

A certain amount of ignorance, on the part of baseball executives, most likely impeded Ryan Howard's baseball progress. A man his size is not easily overlooked. But his career trajectory strongly suggests that his talent was underappreciated. He was not a coveted prospect out of high school and went to Southwest Missouri State to play baseball. After the Phillies selected him in the fifth round of the 2001 draft, he began a slow, four-and-a-half-season climb through the minor leagues, making stops in five different minor-league towns and hitting for power and a decent average in each of them.

In 2004, splitting time between Double A and Triple A, he hit 46 home runs and knocked in 131 runs, the kind of performance that ought to bring about a promotion to the big leagues -- especially considering that Howard was already 24. But the Phillies had a veteran at first base, Jim Thome, to whom they had paid millions as a free agent, and Howard began the 2005 season in Scranton, Pa., back in Triple A.

Thome was signed after Howard had already been a Phillies minor leaguer for two seasons; another team, recognizing what it had in Howard, might have spent its free-agent money elsewhere to avoid a logjam at first base. But the Phillies, with no postseason appearances since 1993, have not been the canniest of franchises.

From his parents, who lived through the civil rights struggle in Birmingham and often talked to their children about that era, Howard already knew something about patience and perspective. He didn't much like being stuck in the minor leagues, but knew it wasn't the worst thing that could happen to a person. ''I learned what I could,'' he says of his years in the minors. His father says: ''We didn't see a frustration on Ryan's part. We saw a strong determination.''

After Thome suffered a season-ending injury, Howard finally secured a full-time spot with the Phillies in 2005 -- and hit 22 home runs and earned the National League Rookie of the Year award while playing just a little over half a season. A player who can accomplish that at age 25 -- then follow it up with the season Howard had last year -- almost certainly could have held his own in the big leagues a couple of years earlier. And Howard's extended time in the minors cost him money. His salary last season was $355,000, a pittance by baseball's current economics. He is still a year from arbitration, and can't become a free agent until after the 2011 season, when he will be 32. He has not publicly made an issue of his contract, but recently he switched to a more prominent agent.

In one sense, though, Howard was probably lucky to end up with the Phillies, whose manager, Charlie Manuel, while not much admired for his in-game strategy, is widely considered to have a deep knowledge of hitting. Howard was still in the low minor leagues when Manuel, then an assistant in the Phillies' front office, first saw him bat. Manuel noticed something unusual about Howard's style: he stood way off the plate, and his posture was oriented toward foul ground in left field, like a golfer who compensates for a wicked slice by aiming wide of the fairway.

In Howard's case, he did not like to handle pitches inside, in on his hands, and his strength still allowed him to hit outside pitches a long way. So he took a stance that forced pitchers to throw the ball about a foot inside the plate to jam him. Manuel saw Howard hit a home run to left field and concluded that because of the way he was standing, it was more like a center- or right-field home run -- he had to pull the ball just to keep it fair.

''We got him straightened out a little bit, so it wasn't so extreme,'' Manuel says. ''He was the type of kid you always could talk to.''

All hitters, though, have a way they want to hit, a style that feels natural. Howard's left-field orientation is still a large part of his approach. When he hits the ball to the left of second base, he almost always lifts it, which is what pitchers specifically try to avoid with home-run hitters: fly balls. When he pulls the ball, he hits more ground balls and low line drives with top spin -- the type that do not carry over fences. ''The amazing thing is, even with all those home runs, Ryan's still learning to pull it,'' says Milt Thompson, the Phillies' hitting coach. ''When he learns to clear his hips out of there and get the ball in the air, you'll really see something.''

Pitchers defeat hitters with good pitches, of course, but all hitters have a way they get themselves out, the most common being a lack of patience. Instead of hoarding their energy -- their ''load'' or ''power load,'' as it is called in baseball -- they commit to a swing too soon, particularly on off-speed pitches, and by the time the bat meets the ball they have expended much of their power.

Howard is different. When he gets himself out, it is more often the result of an overabundance of patience. He lets the ball get too close to his body and does not get the barrel of the bat fully around it. ''It's unusual in any player, let alone a big strong kid just into the league,'' Manuel says. ''But that's why Ryan hits the ball the way he does. He's rarely out in front of where he wants to be. He's got his full load intact when he does make contact.''

Howard takes a slight uppercut, quick and compact. ''Ted Williams used to say, The longer the arc, the farther the ball will go,'' Manuel says. ''I say, The longer the arc, the slower the swing. Ryan has all the power he needs with that shorter arc.''

After Howard and I were finished eating at O'Charley's and the table was cleared, I unpacked my laptop and we watched a sort of greatest-hits collection, a compilation of his home runs that the Phillies had copied onto a DVD. He enjoyed it -- what player wouldn't? -- but what struck me was how much he remembered. He came to the plate 704 times last season and saw 2,859 pitches, yet now he recalled pitch sequences from months before. He doesn't keep a notebook, as some hitters do, but it seems he doesn't have to.

''This is a pretty good AB,'' he said as we watched him step in for his at-bat against the New York Mets' Guillermo Mota. ''He was mixing it up pretty good. Fastballs, change-ups, inside, outside.'' After eight pitches, including several foul balls, the count was full. Mota threw a change-up, and Howard barely managed to foul it off. ''That was a tough pitch -- nasty,'' he said. ''Here comes the fastball now.'' The next pitch was indeed a fastball, which Howard hit over the center-field fence for his 47th home run.

Not surprisingly, considering he is the son of a computer programmer, Howard talks about hitting as if each at-bat is a problem to be solved: ''If the pitcher is one you've faced before, you have to be thinking, How did he try to get me out? He might try something different this time, but you have to have that in the back of your mind. Each at-bat and each pitch you have a game plan that comes about from processing all the information you have.''

Mike Arbuckle, who is in charge of the Phillies' minor-league system, told me: ''Ryan has the aptitude and the intelligence to maximize all that natural ability he has. To be honest with you, there are more guys who aren't that way than are. And he also has the inner drive to want to apply all that intelligence, and that's not always the case, either.''

The DVD included Howard's big game against Tim Hudson. After we watched the last home run, the line drive to left field, Howard said he would have had no idea, as he swung, that the pitch was outside. ''That's the point at which you can't be thinking about anything,'' he said. ''You have a game plan, but then it's instinct. You just see the pitch and go after it.''

The camera followed Howard into the dugout after that last home run, then back out onto the top step, where he waved to acknowledge the home crowd's standing ovation. Together, we were watching him at a moment of maximum glory -- the Slugger in full -- but he seemed to want to deflect attention from himself, to display, as always, proper baseball demeanor.

In the background, we caught a glimpse of Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins, who seemed to be laughing with a kind of wide-eyed, can-you-believe-this expression on his face. ''Look at Jimmy,'' Ryan Howard said, his own face breaking into a grin. ''He seems like he got a big kick out of that, doesn't he?''

	Baseball's Leading Man of Math Has Some Second Thoughts About the Numbers


With the score tied, the bases loaded and a division title at stake, Steve Finley walked to the Dodger Stadium batter's box in the ninth inning last October with a grin. ''I knew the game was over,'' he said afterward. On the second pitch, he sent the ball flying through the late-afternoon California sunshine toward the bleachers, and the Dodgers had beaten the Giants.

The grand slam seemed a proper season's capstone for Finley, a veteran outfielder whom the Dodgers had acquired from Arizona before the trade deadline.

When games were on the line in 2004, he did his best hitting.

What you think this says about Finley, and about what he is likely to do for the Angels this season, offers a good litmus test of your place in baseball's ideological universe.

If you believe his 2004 heroics prove him to be a clutch hitter, you belong to the majority party. Call yourself a traditionalist, and know that most managers and players stand with you.

If you think Finley is no more likely to be a big-game performer this year than Alex Rodriguez -- who tended to melt in the clutch last year -- consider yourself a Jamesian. You share the view of many statistics lovers who have been inspired by the writings of Bill James. You consider clutch hitters to be the Loch Ness monsters of baseball, because you know that players who outdo themselves in the clutch one season rarely repeat the performances during the next.

The debate had not changed much for years. Then Bill James himself announced that he was thinking of switching parties.

In an essay published this winter -- in something called The Baseball Research Journal, a Jamesian outlet if ever there was one -- he argued that clutch hitters might indeed walk the earth. Not only that, but he also proceeded to challenge a handful of other numbers-based doctrines, including the belief that hot and cold streaks do not exist.

James, who made his name writing the ''Baseball Abstract'' books and currently advises the Red Sox, said he no longer had faith in the numbers he and others long used to make their arguments about clutch hitting and the like.

The statistics now seem far too noisy to him -- based on too little data -- to trump ideas with an inherent ring of truth to them.

''I was wrong about something, wrong about something important, for a long time,'' James said by e-mail last week. ''And since I had contributed heavily to creating the problem, I realized that I had to do what I could to address it.''

The central idea behind much baseball analysis is persistence.

Hitting for average, hitting for power, drawing walks, striking out batters and stealing bases are all obvious skills because the players who do them well one year tend to do them well again the next.

But if there is no pattern from one season to another, Jamesians argue, there is probably no underlying skill.

Steve Finley, as it happened, hit worse with runners in scoring position during 2003 than he did when nobody was on base. Did that make him a choker? Or did 2004 make him clutch?

Neither, statistics mavens say. He is just a good hitter who sometimes succeeds in big situations and sometimes fails. You do not get one head and one tail every time you flip a coin twice, and Finley will not replicate his career statistics in every given situation.

There seems to be no persistence, in other words, to clutch hitting. ''Here today, gone tomorrow,'' James wrote in the essay. The same can be said of a handful of other traditionalist chestnuts, like streakiness. The problem, James now says, is that his old argument rested on a shaky stack of statistics.

Imagine if a doctor checked for breathing problems once a week by placing a stethoscope over a patient's winter coat and listening for changes. Every exam would be flawed -- filled with noise, as statisticians say -- because of the coat. But the comparison of one exam with another would be even worse, with any small differences between them overwhelmed by uncertainty.

In baseball, luck and randomness -- weather, ballpark dimensions, the pitcher -- play the role of the winter coat. And the search for clutch hitters involves not just one comparison that compounds the statistical noise. It has two: the differential between a player's normal and clutch batting averages and the difference between this differential across seasons.

This messiness could disguise any clutch hitting.

''We ran astray because we have been assuming that random data is proof of nothingness,'' James wrote, ''when in reality random data proves nothing.'' (The essay, ''Underestimating the Fog,'' is available at sabr.org.)

But the richest thing about James's mea culpa may be the conclusion worth drawing from it. Just as common sense says that some people handle pressure better than others, it seems likely that these differences are not large among major leaguers.

True chokers will flame out well before reaching the big leagues. Players who discover an edge in clutch situations, meanwhile, will almost certainly try to use it at other times, too.

If it exists, clutchness probably creates only a few extra hits for a batter over the course of a season, despite announcers who claim to see it in every game.

So James's old view might have had the rare distinction of being wrong and still being closer to the truth than the other side's argument.

	The Nation: Let's Do Crunch; Electric Blues in La-La Land: Don't Blame Deregulation


CALIFORNIANS are facing electricity blackouts, and the state's investor-owned utilities warned they are about to go bankrupt. Electricity-dependent industries, notably in Silicon Valley, are scrambling to buy generators. Consumers are up in arms over rising prices and disrupted service.

How did something as basic, and previously reliable, as electricity  become such a problem? The shorthand answer is ''deregulation.''

''We have lost control over our own power,'' declared Gov. Gray Davis in his State of the State address last week. ''We have surrendered the decisions about where electricity is sold -- and for how much -- to private companies with  only one objective: maximizing unheard-of profits.'' Railing against  ''out-of-state profiteers,'' the governor warned he might seize power plants by eminent domain.

Mr. Gray's oratory marked a sharp departure from his image as a careful, even boring, moderate. But it was in keeping with much of the initial reaction to the California crisis. In a typical take, Robert Scheer, a liberal columnist for The Los Angeles Times, declared the mess a sign that ''capitalism is falling apart.''

Not so fast, say economists and advocates of open markets.

''Calling the California electricity market 'deregulated' completely changes the meaning of the term,'' says Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution. California changed its regulatory scheme, he said. It didn't free its electricity market.

Though it was called deregulation, the bill the legislature passed in 1996 was the size of a city phone directory, according to a report at the time, and it was extremely complex.

The law cut consumer rates by 10 percent and established future price caps. It made utilities sell their power plants. It dictated that electricity be bought and sold only in a single spot market. And it banned all separately negotiated contracts, including long-term deals for lower prices, between power producers and utilities.

In a 1993 journal article, Dr. Winston defined deregulation as ''the state's withdrawal of its legal powers to direct the economic conduct  (pricing, entry, and exit) of nongovernmental bodies.'' By that measure, the California scheme doesn't even come close, he says. Neither, he says, do recent efforts to overhaul telecommunications regulation.

FAR from deregulating, California's new regime evokes the regulatory mindset of the ''rational reformers'' of the early 20th century.

Amid rapid technological and business evolution, they promised ''kinetic change made stable,'' writes John M. Jordan, a historian, in his book ''Machine-Age Ideology: Social Engineering and American  Liberalism, 1911-1939'' (University of North Carolina, 1994). Controlling economic transactions through  technocratic oversight rather than unpredictable markets was the primary means to that goal.

SIMILARLY, Steve Peace, the Democratic state senator who pushed the utility bill through the California legislature, declared when it passed  that the goal was to ''bring stability to the system,'' while lowering costs  for all consumers.

He wanted, he said, to avoid the ''kind of horror stories we saw in the telecommunications restructuring'' -- the breakup of Ma Bell -- ''where it took 20 years to make the transition and there were a lot of dislocations that occurred in the process.''

This emphasis on stability and predictability is incompatible with real deregulation, since unregulated markets inevitably bring surprises, good and bad. No one knew the airlines would develop hub-and-spoke systems (which offer more destinations, but inconvenience some travelers) or frequent flier  programs. No one anticipated the way trucking deregulation would combine with precision-timed inventory practices and other logistical innovations to revolutionize the flow of goods.

Trucking and airline deregulation (with the exception of landing-slot controls) pass Dr. Winston's test. In those cases, the government really did get out of the market.

Veterans of those deregulations say one sign California's power plan  wasn't the real thing was that it assumed knowledge of the future. ''When they did this thing in California, they were thinking that they were in this world that would stretch out to infinity of falling prices,'' says Christopher DeMuth, president of the American Enterprise Institute and administrator of regulatory affairs at the Office of Management and Budget during the Reagan administration. Capping consumer prices looked like ''a sop  that wouldn't make much difference,'' he says. But when demand for power rose sharply as supplies fell, that cap ''made all the difference in the world.''

True deregulation is rare for the same reason that the rational reformers almost never achieved truly disinterested technocracy. Political pressures inevitably intervene. The earlier reformers learned from  experience, writes Dr. Jordan, that ''there was no 'superpolitical' place to escape the logic of politics.''

And economists who have worked to deregulate industries note that there is always a struggle with advocates who want to turn ''deregulation'' into a more beneficial form of regulation.

Californians, though some of them may not realize it, are now learning that lesson the hard way.

	Editorial Observer; The Pursuit of Innocence in the Golden State


I remember her vividly, a woman standing in the liquor aisle of a grocery store in a Sacramento suburb. She had a cigarette in one hand and with the other she placed a fifth of store-brand vodka in the grocery cart. I was 14, and it was a summer morning, 1966. My family had moved to California from Iowa only a week before, fresh as a load of turnips just lifted from the soil. I knew the woman was divorced by the way she held her cigarette, by the way she did not look around to see if anyone was watching when she took the vodka off the shelf. In Iowa, liquor was segregated in a state-owned store with all the sensory appeal of an auto-body shop. No one divorced, and smoking was, if nothing worse, a waste of matches.

Iowans moved to California in droves about then, and not to drink, divorce and smoke. They went for all the reasons people still go to California, for jobs and a less punishing climate and a new beginning. But one of the thrills of California, like seeing a line of palm trees or eating an artichoke or an avocado, was coming across a woman like that, a Tippi Hedren who converted what were vices in one state into the ordinary domestic manners of another and who implied, by her bearing, that if there was a problem, it was your problem. I look at Lisa Yuskavage's dewy, bosomy paintings, and I remember that California seemed exactly that voluptuous to me, its sins undone by the frankness with which they were revealed.

It was easy to believe that California was somehow defined by the casual license that woman embodied. But the woman, shopping for vodka, as it were, in her negligee, and the boy looking on, entranced and scandalized -- that is the true social and ethical dynamic of the golden state. It has always replicated, in its own way, the dynamic of America itself, a nation where some came to make a fresh start with a new rigor and others came to free themselves from rigor. If it could make electricity with the turbine of desire and disapproval, California would never run out of power.

Nowadays, no one dreams of lighting a cigarette in a California supermarket, and even the store-brand vodkas try to look as upscale as the Finnish and Swedish brands. Divorce is the common coin of modern sexuality, as the children of many of those Iowa-raised Californians grew up to discover for themselves. I remember how surprised I was to see farms when my family moved to California, when hops fields still grew on the southern outskirts of Sacramento. But California has been doing away with that unpleasant surprise for the past three decades. Now there are houses and houses and houses.

Electricity is a metaphorical form of energy as well as a literal one, a symbol, ever since the first kilowatt was generated, of human power over nature. There are, of course, complicated, interlacing causes for California's current energy crisis, rooted in bad planning and bad deregulatory designs. But one cause is the lack of human power over human nature, a growth in consumption fueled by an endless faith in repeated fresh starts, industrial and domestic. If you add up all of California's gospels -- the canons of social responsibility and individual liberty, of market freedom and unfettered growth -- you come up with a cumulative sense of innocence, which is one of the things that really gall the other Western states, which have come to understand California better than it understands itself.

Californians talk about nothing but change, because that is the landscape they live in. The rate of change is so rapid, and has been for so many years now, that the idea of conservation seems almost futile. Or rather, it seems commodified and impersonal, dependent on more efficient appliances, less consumptive houses and cleaner cars instead of altered behavior and wiser choices. California believes in innocence with the same fervor it believes in newness, in the psychology of starting over again. Electricity is the perfect metaphor for that easy faith. It is always new, always fresh, intangible and killing at the same time.

	Health Agency Tightens Rules Governing Federal Scientists


After accusations that some government scientists used their official positions for private gain, the National Institutes of Health announced rules on Thursday that ban its scientists from consulting for drug companies.

''Our research should be based on scientific evidence that is not influenced by any other factors,'' Dr. Elias A. Zerhouni, director of the health institutes, said at a news conference.

The rules are being issued after disclosures that scientists at the institutes leveraged their positions to land lucrative consulting contracts that seemed to conflict with their official duties or at least overlap with them. Those contracts caused some critics to worry that research by the agency could be tainted.

An investigation by the agency concluded that 44 of its 1,200 senior scientists appeared to have violated rules governing consulting and that 9 might have violated criminal laws.

The conflicts were first reported by The Los Angeles Times.

The regulations are not as draconian as those that an internal panel proposed in February. Under those proposals, which caused an uproar, not only was consulting banned, but 6,000 scientists would have also been forced to sell all shares they owned in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

Any remunerative activity outside of work -- even selling jewelry or singing -- would have had to be disclosed and approved by ethics overseers. All 18,000 employees would have been forced to limit their holdings in any one company to shares valued at no more than $15,000.

Under the final rules, the top 200 executives will be required to keep the value of their holdings in any single drug company below $15,000. Some 6,000 other employees will have to submit for review their holdings in such companies. If the holdings are determined to conflict with official responsibilities, the employees will be asked to sell these shares, officials said.

Agency scientists will also be allowed to hold fiduciary positions in medical societies as part of their lives outside the agency, a practice that the proposed rules would have banned.

''Clearly, we do not want to impede the normal academic interactions that scientists need to have with the rest of the world,'' Dr. Zerhouni said.

The changes were welcomed by scientists at the agency who had fiercely criticized the old proposals.

''This is a very good step forward, but it doesn't end the issue,'' said Dr. Ezekial Emanuel, chairman of the executive committee of the Assembly of Scientists, a group that filed a suit against the old rules and then withdrew it.

His group, Dr. Emanuel said, would continue to fight travel bans and bureaucratic inertia that he said is hurting the agency.

The changes disappointed some critics of the pharmaceutical industry's influence on research.

''These rules by no means end the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on N.I.H. employees,'' said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the health research group at Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group.

Dr. Wolfe noted that the new rules let employees deliver medical education lectures paid for by drug companies. Although no strings are supposed to be attached to the financing, Dr. Wolfe noted that scientists who disagreed with the positions of the drug industry were rarely invited to give such lectures.

The controversy surrounding consulting work and scientists' relationships with drug companies has been a black eye for the health institutes, which has for years enjoyed highly favorable press coverage and widespread support on Capitol Hill.

Investigations found that the health institutes had such poor and inconsistent controls over scientists' outside activities that the agency could not even answer investigators' basic questions about the extent of the problem.

One scientist, Dr. P. Trey Sunderland, a senior researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health, received more than $500,000 in consulting fees from Pfizer at the time he was collaborating with the company in his official work of studying patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Despite rules that require government scientists to notify the institutes of their consulting deals, Dr. Sunderland did not make such a report.

Dr. Zerhouni initially dismissed the problems as paperwork issues or the indiscretions of a few people. But as the disclosures built, he proposed modest changes.

Late last year, he proposed a one-year ban on all consulting work while the agency improved controls. Dr. Zerhouni termed the new rules ''the most restrictive of any we know about in the world of biomedical research.''

The revisions were made after officials received more than 1,300 comments, many fiercely critical, on the proposal. Dr. Zerhouni said he was not surprised that so many employees opposed the proposed rules. He said it was always his intent to adapt the new rules after receiving comments from outside.

The rules go into effect on Tuesday. Officials will have to divest their stock portfolios by Jan. 30. Dr. Zerhouni said he intended to re-examine the new rules in a year to make sure they have not had negative effects on the agency's ability to recruit top scientists.

Dr. Zerhouni also said he hoped to spur a broader discussion about conflicts of interest in universities.

	Agency Scientists Divided Over Ethics Ban on Consulting


New rules prohibiting outside consulting arrangements by researchers at the National Institutes of Health have been welcomed by some scientists, with the agency's director saying that group has ''said that we needed this.'' But others, said the director, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, have threatened ''to walk across the street'' to work for organizations that do not have such a ban.

The rules, formally announced at a news conference on Tuesday, ban consulting arrangements by scientists at the agency and pharmaceutical and biotech companies.

''There's no doubt that among the majority of the 5,000 scientists who never did anything wrong and never broke any rules, they see this as being taken into a tsunami of regulations,'' Dr. Zerhouni said.

Dr. Sheldon Krimsky, a researcher at Tufts University who specializes in science policy and ethics, said the changes were welcome, albeit overdue.

''Imagine if someone working for one of the economic agencies of government made a deal with a company involved in forecasting and gave them privileged access to government data,'' Dr. Krimsky said. ''It would never have flown, but somehow biomedical scientists got away with it.''

The rules, which will take effect in a few days, grew out of revelations over the past year that some of the agency's leading scientists had lent their names to drug industry marketing efforts.

Under them, N.I.H. scientists will be banned from working in either a paid or an unpaid capacity for drug and biotechnology companies, health care providers, insurers, trade associations and educational institutions that apply for money from the agency.

The rules will also ban top scientists from owning shares in drug or biotechnology companies. Lower-level employees will be able to own as much as $15,000 in company shares. Gifts of greater than $200 will be banned. Scientists will be prohibited from accepting many academic prizes.

''Nothing is more important than preserving the public trust,'' Dr. Zerhouni said.

Banning consulting arrangements between government scientists and private companies is the only way to avoid such conflicts, Dr. Krimsky said.

For much of last year, Dr. Zerhouni insisted that some N.I.H. scientists should be allowed to continue their consulting arrangements, not only to prevent them from leaving the agency for more lucrative jobs elsewhere but also because such arrangements sharpened their skills. He derided calls for complete bans as ''ivory tower'' proposals that flew in the face of the agency's need to work toward cures.

But revelations that some agency scientists had lent their names -- and thus the name of the institution -- to drug industry marketing efforts made him change his mind, Dr. Zerhouni said. He added that less strict proposals that simply banned consulting by top agency administrators would not have stopped lower-level scientists from being ''a marketing tool for the outside party.''

Dr. Zerhouni said the rules would remain in effect until the agency decided to change them. But some said that such a change was unlikely in the foreseeable future.

Among the cases that Dr. Zerhouni has condemned is that of Dr. Bryan Brewer Jr., chief of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's molecular disease branch. In 2003, Dr. Brewer wrote an article promoting the benefits of Crestor, a cholesterol-lowering drug from AstraZeneca.

The article was published in a medical journal ''supplement'' paid for by AstraZeneca, and Dr. Brewer's N.I.H. title was prominently displayed. The article failed to mention potentially serious safety problems with Crestor. Dr. Zerhouni has described Dr. Brewer's Crestor article as ''a product-driven endorsement.''

Cases like Dr. Brewer's were revealed in a series in The Los Angeles Times as well as in hearings held by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The committee's investigation uncovered 30 to 40 N.I.H. scientists who were consulting for drug and biotechnology companies but who had failed to inform the agency or get permission for these arrangements.

Dr. Zerhouni said that many of the cases were still under investigation, and that some of those employees could be disciplined. Sanctions could vary from counseling to dismissal, another official said.

	Journey to the Center of My Mind


At a few minutes after 4 on a Sunday afternoon in January, when most of New York was tuning in to the playoff game between the Jets and the Broncos, I had something else on my mind. More precisely, I had something around my mind, namely the 1.5-ton magnet of the magnetic resonance imaging (M.R.I.) machine at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. I wasn't there for medical reasons; I was there to embark on an adventure. My journey would take me no farther than this laboratory on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and yet I was going somewhere very few people have been.

Of all the frontiers that await exploration, perhaps no other is more intriguing than the terra incognita that lies between our ears. There, in a three-pound pudding of neurons and wiring, lie the keys to the kingdoms of memory, of thought, of desire, of fear, of the habits and skills that add up to who we each are. It is an especially daunting frontier because even after you have entered the realm of the brain, it's still necessary to locate a second, far more elusive boundary that separates the mere hardware of neurology from that elusive quality known as the mind, the ''I'' that hovers in the background of all conscious mental activity. I had hopes of getting a glimpse of that I -- my mind -- in the course of my travels.

My Virgil on this journey through the dark wood of cognition was Joy Hirsch, a voluble, cheerful scientist with dark bangs over her forehead and inch-long nails. Hirsch directs the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Laboratory at Sloan-Kettering and is a professor of neuroscience at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. I'd become interested in her work several years ago when her group published a paper in Nature suggesting that you could tell whether a person learned a foreign language early or late in life by pinpointing the exact location of the speech center in the brain. When I proposed taking a tour of my own brain, Joy saw it as an opportunity to extend her research into some new areas.

The premise was simple. I would undergo a series of brain-imaging sessions using the technology of functional M.R.I. -- like diagnostic M.R.I., except that it also measures brain activity. These scans would, for the most part, be customized, almost autobiographical studies that would probe thoughts and emotions related to my personal history and work as a writer and editor. My journey, I understood, would be unscientific -- no study of one individual holds statistical significance. But even as a neural picaresque, it wasn't without value. We designed exercises with reasonable experimental controls and, whenever possible, in ways that might complement published studies. We set out to investigate, among other things, the use of figurative language, the neural residue of emotional memories, the seat of humor, the source of sentence composition and even the cognitive headwaters of storytelling.

Before setting out, I consulted several prominent brain scientists; Steven Pinker, the cognitive scientist at M.I.T., provided the most sage advice about the proper frame of mind for doing experiments in an M.R.I. machine. ''Focus is essential,'' he said. ''You almost have to be a Zen master.'' Easier said than done.

THE LAY OF THE LAND

For the first session, Joy Hirsch set up 14 scans, designed to sketch out a rough map of the auditory, visual, touch, motor and language systems of my brain. ''This is like a tour of the building before we start to talk to the individual departments,'' Joy said. This kind of mapping was pioneered by Hirsch's team at Sloan-Kettering to provide a guide for neurosurgeons so that they can avoid speech, hearing and other critical centers when removing brain tumors. (One condition for my participation was that patient scans always took precedence.)

As I lay flat on my back, about to enter the narrow bore of the scanner for the first time, Joy and a technician, Greg Nyman, sandwiched my head between cushions, placed a piece of tape across my forehead and slipped a plastic cowl over my head. ''We're going to put you in,'' Joy announced as I felt myself slide about four feet into an aperture 23 inches wide and only 17 inches high. Staring up at a mirror above my head, I could look out of the tube, where the vista included two familiar shoes forming a nervous V in the air. Each ''run,'' Joy explained, would last 144 seconds; the machine divided my brain into about 185,000 units, or voxels, and measured the activity in each every four seconds. The huge, room-size magnet allows the machine to detect subtle changes in blood flow in each voxel, changes that are believed to reflect levels of brain activity.

Science is never quite as seamless as it appears in the pages of journals. The first few runs went fine -- a flashing checkerboard pattern excited my visual cortex, as planned, and Joy rubbed an ordinary five-and-dime pot-scrubber over my right hand, to stimulate the tactile (or somatosensory) part of my brain. I had great difficulty seeing and hearing, however. I couldn't wear my glasses inside the machine -- the powerful magnetic field would turn them into a ballistic missile. The prescription goggles on hand in the lab provided just enough visual acuity to turn an exercise where I named objects into a McGoo-ish misadventure. I mistook a tennis racket for a globe and a canoe for a comb. Later, straining to hear words through earphones, I could make out only a couple over the din of the machine, which sounds like the loudest, most emphatic busy signal imaginable. Again, I resorted to pure conjecture. At this rate, I began to fear we were using our precious M.R.I. time to pinpoint nothing more than the neural headquarters for Guesswork.

Finally, we made our first tentative sortie into the land of cognition. Joy knew I spoke Italian, and I was curious to see where the ''Italian speech module'' was located in my brain. I had learned the language in my mid-20's while living in Rome, but I thought there might be a chance I'd picked up a smattering of Italian as a child, since my maternal grandparents spoke it almost exclusively. It turns out that all languages learned early in life cohabit the same neural real estate, whereas a foreign language learned as an adult usually occupies a distinctly separate region. Would the conversations in Italian I had overheard as a child have left a neural residue?

To find out, Joy asked me to perform a task that formed the basis of the group's 1997 Nature paper. I had 10 seconds to tell a little story in my head in response to a series of visual prompts -- a picture showing either sunrise, noon or night. During the first run, I would think up a scenario in English; the second time, in Italian. The morning scene, for example, elicited the following: ''I woke up around 8 o'clock, had a bite to eat, put on my coat and walked to the subway, which I took to work.'' All I can say in my literary defense is, you try being clever with a deadline of 10 seconds and 110-decibel honks in your ears about five times a second.

Lying stock still in a horizontal phone booth might not sound like much of a physical adventure, but after 50 minutes I felt exhausted by the effort of inactivity. You're supposed to keep your head as steady as a statue, and just as empty. But any active, imaginative intelligence is apt to daydream, worry, have idle thoughts -- all forms of mental static. Thoughts kept crashing through the artificial quietude of my empty head: ''What's the Italian word for joke?'' ''Wonder how the Jets are doing?'' ''Man, is my mouth dry!'' Theoretically, each of those errant thoughts has its latitude and longitude, its little magnetic wrinkle destined, perhaps, to show up in the raw data and fog this high-tech mirror in which I hoped to see something of myself.

ALL ROADS LEAD TO . . . BROCA'S AREA

When I met with Joy to go over the results from the first session, we sat at a round table in her office, with 21 cross-sectional slices of my brain up on the light box, a brain atlas open on the table and small printouts of each cross-section in front of her, marked by yellow Post-it arrows pointing to the predominant landmarks of my neural anatomy. She had carefully compared the lay of my brain to a standard atlas and, slice by slice, walked me through the basic landscape. ''I love looking at brains,'' she confided at one point. ''They're very beautiful, very intimate.'' Everything looked normal. ''This is a beautiful, textbook brain,'' she said with obvious enthusiasm. But I almost didn't hear her. I was mesmerized by the beauty of this hidden landscape.

Now that I was on a guided tour of my own brain, I began to appreciate just how precise the convoluted geography of the brain actually is. Like a lot of laypeople, I thought the whorls and folds on the surface layer of the brain, known as the cortex, varied by individual like so many fingerprints. In fact, the patterns are basically the same in everyone. As I could see in Joy's atlas, each bulge (or gyrus) and each crevice (or sulcus) is as precisely plotted as any topographic map. All the cognitive action happens in those whorls; everything else is scaffolding, underground cable, antique structures handed down by evolution from reptile and early mammalian brains.

The first departments we checked were the somatosensory and motor regions. The touch of the pot-scrubber caused a small section of the post-central gyrus on the left side to light up, as expected, while the finger-tapping exercise caused a herd of neurons just across the deep neural ravine from the tactile center to become active.

''This is very typical,'' Joy said. ''In fact, it's particularly nice. Some brains have a little bit less specific activity. One of the nice things about the activity patterns in your brain is that they are very localized. Your brain just goes and gets the job done. It doesn't waste a lot of energy going other places.''

I'd been concerned about my inability to see and hear stimuli during the first session, but those difficulties actually made the results more interesting. When I was straining to make out images during the object-naming task, my visual cortex looked like the wall of napalm scene in ''Apocalypse Now.'' ''I'll tell you, this little brain was working mighty hard to get that information,'' Joy said with a laugh. The same evidence of effort showed up in the auditory map -- the place in the midbrain that ''listens,'' called the transverse temporal gyrus, was screaming in technicolor, even though I could only make out one or two words.

Finally, we looked at my basic language centers. Language, of course, is normally located on the dominant side of the brain, which in right-handers like me is on the left side. When I spoke to myself in English, therefore, a small patch of cortex on the left side lighted up. This is known as Broca's area, after the French pathologist who first identified it.

The data from the Italian-speaking exercise unfortunately were ambiguous. The image was filled with green blotches that signified movement. As anyone who watched Roberto Benigni at the Academy Awards knows, Italian is a particularly kinetic language. ''The only time you moved your head the whole time was when you were speaking Italian!'' Joy cried, explaining why she couldn't definitively say if my Italian was learned early or late. With prodding, she pointed out a tiny gap between the areas that lighted up when I spoke to myself in English and Italian. ''If I had to call it,'' she said, ''you have Italian sitting above the English, and both of them are pinned together here in Broca's area.'' That tiny gap, about five millimeters, suggested that I'd learned Italian as an adult, not as a child.

If there was a lesson from this first expedition, it was this: in terms of neural architecture, we all live in Levittown. Every brain is pretty much like the next. What makes each unique is how we decorate them, as it were, with experience and memory and habits and skills. Staring at these voluptuous, serpentine folds of cortex, I was struck by the strange commingling of inert anatomy and transcendent human qualities. Buried in those headlands and crevices, I knew, were mental images of grandparents no longer alive, of my mother trying to explain death to me for the first time, the sound of loved ones' voices, my father encouraging me as we played catch, of Roberto Clemente whirling and throwing a baseball, as well as the state capital of Vermont, the square root of 81 and the narrative line of three books I've written. The vastness and steadfastness of those memories, all nestled and synaptically etched in this bland gray and squishy landscape, was a miracle impossible to capture on film and perhaps beyond the grasp of our very modest experiments.

But we could try. We decided to devote the next session to exploring things that might be unique to me as a writer and as a person. We would search for the headwaters of storytelling, and we'd try to see if the brain reacted differently when it encountered family and friends as opposed to the faces and voices of strangers.

TO THE SOURCE OF NARRATIVE

Joy and Diana Moreno, an Argentine graduate student in her lab, devised a plan to watch my brain in action as it invented a story. They would provide me with a set of narrative prompts -- either a sequence of simple images (like a dog or a tree) or, using a different sensory route to the same destination, a sequence of distinctive sound effects (a honking horn, a crying baby). While the M.R.I. was blasting away, I'd ad-lib a running story in my head (see box).

The results were fascinating. We saw the visual cortex light up as expected. But we also saw many small, discrete precincts of the frontal lobe activated on the right side of the brain, with particularly intense activity in an area called the inferior frontal gyrus -- what might be called the storytelling area. ''This is not a subtle effect, Steve,'' Joy pointed out. ''In this business, this is big.'' It seemed to cover at least 1.5 cubic centimeters -- about the size of a sugar cube. I asked her what might account for its size, and she replied that it could be a combination of things: a natural predisposition to use the right side of my brain (nature) and probably my frequent use of it (nurture) in the course of a lifetime.

There were other areas involved; they formed a network, actually. But Joy seemed particularly taken with the notion that the brain parceled out two related capabilities -- one to create stories and the other to articulate them in speech -- in essentially the same place in the two hemispheres, for my storytelling area was the mirror image of the site on the left, dominant side of the brain that controls speech.

Next we compared familiar voices and faces to unfamiliar voices and faces. When I had suggested the idea of looking at familiar faces while in the machine, I thought it might serve as a back road to memory and feeling; the difference between the perception of an unknown and known face should be the neural residue of recognition and familiarity. Once again, we were in for some surprises.

As the M.R.I. beeped around my head, I was shown a series of 52 photographs over the course of four runs, 13 per run. During the first two runs, none of the faces were familiar -- or, at least, they weren't supposed to be. One picture happened to be a spitting image of the girl -- I'll call her D. -- I had a crush on in high school and whom I'd asked, unsuccessfully, to the senior prom. As I processed this image, I experienced what felt like an Etna of neural activity somewhere in my cranium.

During the next two runs, I was shown only familiar faces -- indeed, painfully familiar in the case of images of myself as Sullen Adolescent and Alienated Hirsute Expatriate. My wife, Mindy, had sent Joy's lab photographs of practically everybody I knew: my parents, Mindy giving birth to our son, my nephews, the college friend I bummed around with in Europe, old family friends, even my old landlady from Rome, as well as six photos of my younger self, including a high-school graduation picture of me looking so clueless that I wouldn't have gone to the prom with me.

When we reviewed the brain scans a few days later, I had the thrill of witnessing a unique feature of the physical world for the first time. During the familiar-faces experiment, we saw activity in the visual cortex; no surprise there. We saw activity in the hippocampus. No surprise there, either; the hippocampus, a structure deep in the interior of the brain, is thought to be involved in the storage of long-term memory. ''Your whole hippocampus is screaming!'' Joy said. We also saw activity in a structure adjacent to the hippocampus known as the fusiform gyrus; this, too, was not a surprise, at least not to Joy. Recent research on face recognition has identified this as the key area in the brain for the specialized task of perceiving faces. What was a surprise was that the most excited sector in my brain as it viewed familiar faces was, once again, the ''storytelling area.''

Next, we performed the same exercise using familiar voices: relatives and friends provided the lab with taped monologues addressed to me. Unfortunately, I had the same difficulty making out the voices as in the earlier session; the only voice I could identify unambiguously was that of my wife. I guessed -- correctly, as it turns out -- that other voices belonged to my father, mother and daughter, although I didn't learn until later what they had actually said. My father recalled going to the 1966 All-Star game in St. Louis and meeting the Cub infielder Ron Santo on the plane home. My mother invoked memories of what she called the ''friendly persuader'' of my mischievous childhood (the wooden spoon). And my 3-year-old daughter, Micaela, had chattered, ''Testing, one-two-three, Daddy, I love you, testing one-two-three.'' I didn't hear any of it.

But, remarkably, my brain apparently did. The scans showed the exact same far-flung network of parts fired up as when I was looking at familiar pictures -- including the storytelling region in my right brain. It was almost as if I subconsciously filtered out the background noise and heard what I needed to hear. And not only that, simply hearing familiar voices activated the visual cortex, as if I mentally pictured the people whose voices I heard.

Joy used that all-purpose, noncommittal, scientifically discreet word to describe this effect: interesting. Exercising the layperson's right to speculate, I was immediately taken by a literary notion: the role of narrative in memory. What the data seemed to suggest to me was that part of what makes a face or a voice familiar to us is that the brain attaches it to a narrative. Perhaps we ''tag'' people with narratives to help us remember them. The image or voice (and perhaps even the taste, touch or smell) of a familiar person summons up from our memories the story we've woven them into. That madeleine of Marcel Proust's seems less like a literary conceit and more like a brilliant scientific insight -- but then Proust understood at least as much about memory as any modern neuroscientist.

THE LAND OF METAPHOR

To map the creation of sentences in my brain, Joy showed me a series of words -- highway, dawn, border -- and asked me to use them in the most elaborate sentences I could think of, all in 10 seconds. One that stuck in my mind was, ''The border between here and there is uncertain, and moving further into the future even as we speak.''

Joy was particularly amused when she showed me the results of this exercise. The areas of activity were small, relatively discrete and, unlike virtually all of the other creative tasks I performed, well represented on the left as well as the right side of the brain, indicating, she said, excellent mental economy.

I reverted to my right-hemisphere bias on two other tasks: creating metaphors and synonyms. I suppose there might be something socially redeeming about spitting out a metaphor on cue, every four seconds, but after shoveling out 10 examples of figurative language in 40 seconds, it began to feel like an aerobic activity. The cues, once again, were simple illustrations: a globe, a wreath, a canoe, a snail, a tennis racket, a seahorse and so on. Considering some of my responses -- Up the creek without a paddle'' and ''You've got quite a racket going on,'' to name two -- I worried that we'd overshot Metaphor Mountain on the map and landed in the Slough of Cliche.

Not so. During this task -- and to a great degree, during the Great Thesauric Expedition (as I now call the synonym task) -- the right side of my brain lighted up like a neon sign on a cheap diner. Almost all the usual suspects were on display: parts of the visual cortex, the language area, that interesting storytelling area in the inferior frontal gyrus and a spot toward the top of the brain, the medial frontal gyrus, that Joy believed was organizing and coordinating high-level activity on a number of tasks. With Joy's help, I was beginning to recognize a network I seemed to use over and over again.

As we reviewed the results, it occurred to me that we had begun to exhaust the usefulness of the geographic metaphor -- and perhaps that was the real point of the entire exercise. The more complex the task, the more dispersed the brain's activity. The pattern in the scans stopped looking like a landscape with a few isolated peaks and more like a circuit with an extravagant number of relay points.

The potential link between circuitry and consciousness became especially clear when we went looking for the seat of humor. Joy showed me Gary Larson cartoons, first with neutral, unfunny captions and then with their proper punch lines. Perhaps because of the circumstances, one cartoon in particular had me struggling to suppress a laugh. It showed a group of doctors in the midst of brain surgery. The neutral caption read, ''Operating Room''; the Larson caption had one of the surgeons exclaiming: ''Wow! His brain still uses vacuum tubes!''

In response to this and other cartoons, my brain looked like those aerial shots of Southern California during brush-fire season: there were little embers of neural activity all over. The hippocampus lighted up, suggesting the involvement of memory; the thalamus on the right side became active (the first time we'd seen that in any of our experiments), suggesting sensory processing, and we even detected a little activity in the sensorimotor cortex, which normally controls physical movement. Joy immediately thought ''smile,'' and I thought ''laugh.'' Like a Chopin impromptu, my ''humor network'' hit a great many notes, high in the brain and low, and did so with lightning rapidity: visual processing, language processing, memory, the perception of a cognitive disjunction, and all of it seemingly wired to trip a laugh instantaneously. Moreover, this network began to suggest something more complex than mere cognition -- something like consciousness, for humor is very personal, turning as it does on such idiosyncratic traits as one's sense of irony, cognitive dissonance and Schadenfreude. The network we were seeing, with its unique linkages, represented my sense of humor.

THERE IS NO CENTER THERE

As I look at my brain again, slice by slice, holding the film up to a window in my study, I am struck once more with the everyday wonder of the landscape -- the shadowy lines of sulci running like streams to nowhere from the interior of the cerebrum, the peninsular gyri, each plump with purpose and secrets, and, like a river running through it all, the midline separating right hemisphere from left. And more than ever, I realize that the organizing metaphor for this expedition -- a journey to the center of my mind -- has been misleading. As task after task demonstrated, there is no center of activity, only way stations in a circuit, winking at each other in milliseconds, churning in some mysterious neural communion. And the notion of mind? We didn't make much progress penetrating that mystery. Perhaps it's nothing more than the heat given off by our personalized circuits, everywhere and yet nowhere.

If, as Joseph Conrad once said, the most interesting places are the empty spaces on a map, the prefrontal cortex must be an especially fascinating place for brain scientists. We were puzzled by the general dearth of activity in my frontal lobe; although it is supposed to be the real crucible of human thought, none of our exercises seemed to tickle it into much activity. Indeed, there were many questions I wished to ask that we couldn't approach for reasons of practicality or time, or an inability to even formulate a workable experimental question. I was interested, for example, in exploring skills more particular to an editor than a writer, like fixing ungrammatical sentences. I would have liked to probe emotions more intently, especially things we feel every day like anger and insecurity and sexual arousal, but it turns out they are exceedingly difficult to test in a meaningful way. I would have also liked to see what the brain looked like as it wrestled with a moral dilemma.

Brain scientists would like to know the answers to many of those questions, too. But as Joy, whose great-grandmother traveled the Oregon Trail, likes to point out, we're still in the ''covered wagon'' phase of mapping brain function. ''When the real pioneers started their journey, they had no shortage of ideas about what Oregon was going to look like.'' she said. ''And similarly, we have no shortage of ideas about mind and consciousness, even though we really haven't gone very far into the frontier.'' Even a modest journey like mine, however, hints at the territory ahead. ''We have been able to observe several of the interconnected systems in your brain and perhaps have glimpsed some of your consciousness at work, even if it was only a snapshot of a brief instant of your life.''

In our age-old struggle to understand the mind, we have always been empowered -- yet oddly constrained -- by the vocabulary of the moment, be it the voices of the gods in ancient myth, buried conflicts in the idiom of Freudian analysis or associative memories in Proustian terms. But as psychology and neuroscience begin to converge, brain imaging may actually provide a new, visual vocabulary with which to rethink, and perhaps reconcile, some of these older ideas of mind. A common thread of both the Freudian and Proustian worldviews is the associative quality of recollection -- the odd word or sight that connects to a deeper trauma, the odor that connects to a more extensive memory. Association requires connections, and as I saw, a brain scan of humor, for example, can actually depict a rich skein of associations in a diagram of neural connections. Preposterous as it may seem, I can imagine a day in the distant future when the M.R.I. replaces the couch, when the therapist uses words or odors or pictures to excite and pinpoint circuitry and then the neuroanatomist translates the images into explanations of behavior. Of course, there is always the possibility that after decades of exploration in search of mind, we'll still find ourselves, metaphorically speaking, knee-deep in a swamp of neurotransmitters that may bring us no closer to a biological understanding of ''mind.''

It's odd to put it this way, but I may know more about how my brain works than almost any human who has ever lived, and yet that knowledge has won nothing more than a beachhead on a vast, uncharted continent. That is no small achievement, though my journey makes clear that these are early days in the brain-mapping business. I cannot say what in my genetics or upbringing might have contributed to the hive of activity we observed in the right side of my brain. Or why I remember everything about the moment when my friend D. agreed to go to the prom with me 30 years ago but nothing about the moment when she changed her mind. Given the insecurities of adolescence and the uncertainties of affection, it seemed at the time like one of those watershed moments of my life, and even now it can still produce a wince, but it appears to have eluded the gaze of the M.R.I. machine. For when we went back and examined the scans taken in the moment when I thought I'd been shown D.'s face, the data had been subsumed in a stream of average responses. It didn't leave a trace.

	Of Two Minds


The human brain is mysterious -- and, in a way, that is a good thing. The less that is known about how the brain works, the more secure the zone of privacy that surrounds the self. But that zone seems to be shrinking. A couple of weeks ago, two scientists revealed that they had found a way to peer directly into your brain and tell what you are looking at, even when you yourself are not yet aware of what you have seen. So much for the comforting notion that each of us has privileged access to his own mind.

Opportunities for observing the human mental circuitry in action have, until recent times, been almost nonexistent, mainly because of a lack of live volunteers willing to sacrifice their brains to science. To get clues on how the brain works, scientists had to wait for people to suffer sometimes gruesome accidents and then see how the ensuing brain damage affected their abilities and behavior. The results could be puzzling. Damage to the right frontal lobe, for example, sometimes led to a heightened interest in high cuisine, a condition dubbed gourmand syndrome. (One European political journalist, upon recovering from a stroke affecting this part of the brain, profited from the misfortune by becoming a food columnist.)

Today scientists are able to get some idea of what's going on in the mind by using brain scanners. Brain-scanning is cruder than it sounds. A technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging can reveal which part of your brain is most active when you're solving a mathematical puzzle, say, or memorizing a list of words. The scanner doesn't actually pick up the pattern of electrical activity in the brain; it just shows where the blood is flowing. (Active neurons demand more oxygen and hence more blood.)

In the current issue of Nature Neuroscience, however, Frank Tong, a cognitive neuroscientist at Vanderbilt University, and Yukiyasu Kamitani, a researcher in Japan, announced that they had discovered a way of tweaking the brain-scanning technique to get a richer picture of the brain's activity. Now it is possible to infer what tiny groups of neurons are up to, not just larger areas of the brain. The implications are a little astonishing. Using the scanner, Tong could tell which of two visual patterns his subjects were focusing on -- in effect, reading their minds. In an experiment carried out by another research team, the scanner detected visual information in the brains of subjects even though, owing to a trick of the experiment, they themselves were not aware of what they had seen.

How will our image of ourselves change as the wrinkled lump of gray meat in our skull becomes increasingly transparent to such exploratory methods? One recent discovery to confront is that the human brain can readily change its structure -- a phenomenon scientists call neuroplasticity. A few years ago, brain scans of London cabbies showed that the detailed mental maps they had built up in the course of navigating their city's complicated streets were apparent in their brains. Not only was the posterior hippocampus -- one area of the brain where spatial representations are stored -- larger in the drivers; the increase in size was proportional to the number of years they had been on the job.

It may not come as a great surprise that interaction with the environment can alter our mental architecture. But there is also accumulating evidence that the brain can change autonomously, in response to its own internal signals. Last year, Tibetan Buddhist monks, with the encouragement of the Dalai Lama, submitted to functional magnetic resonance imaging as they practiced ''compassion meditation,'' which is aimed at achieving a mental state of pure loving kindness toward all beings. The brain scans showed only a slight effect in novice meditators. But for monks who had spent more than 10,000 hours in meditation, the differences in brain function were striking. Activity in the left prefrontal cortex, the locus of joy, overwhelmed activity in the right prefrontal cortex, the locus of anxiety. Activity was also heightened in the areas of the brain that direct planned motion, ''as if the monks' brains were itching to go to the aid of those in distress,'' Sharon Begley reported in The Wall Street Journal. All of which suggests, say the scientists who carried out the scans, that ''the resting state of the brain may be altered by long-term meditative practice.''

But there could be revelations in store that will force us to revise our self-understanding in far more radical ways. We have already had a hint of this in the so-called split-brain phenomenon. The human brain has two hemispheres, right and left. Each hemisphere has its own perceptual, memory and control systems. For the most part, the left hemisphere is associated with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The left hemisphere usually controls speech. Connecting the hemispheres is a cable of nerve fibers called the corpus callosum.

Patients with severe epilepsy sometimes used to undergo an operation in which the corpus callosum was severed. (The idea was to keep a seizure from spreading from one side of the brain to the other.) After the operation, the two hemispheres of the brain could no longer directly communicate. Such patients typically resumed their normal lives without seeming to be any different. But under careful observation, they exhibited some very peculiar behavior. When, for example, the word ''hat'' was flashed to the left half of the visual field -- and hence to the right (speechless) side of the brain -- the left hand would pick out a hat from a group of concealed objects, even as the patient insisted that he had seen no word. If a picture of a naked woman was flashed to the left visual field of a male patient, he would smile, or maybe blush, without being able to say what he was reacting to -- although he might make a comment like, ''That's some machine you've got there.'' In another case, a female patient's right hemisphere was flashed a scene of one person throwing another into a fire. ''I don't know why, but I feel kind of scared,'' she told the researcher. ''I don't like this room, or maybe it's you getting me nervous.'' The left side of her brain, noticing the negative emotional reaction issuing from the right side, was making a guess about its cause, much the way one person might make a guess about the emotions of another.

Each side of the brain seemed to have its own awareness, as if there were two selves occupying the same head. (One patient's left hand seemed somewhat hostile to the patient's wife, suggesting that the right hemisphere was not fond of her.) Ordinarily, the two selves got along admirably, falling asleep and waking up at the same time and successfully performing activities that required bilateral coordination, like swimming and playing the piano. Nevertheless, as laboratory tests showed, they lived in ever so slightly different sensory worlds. And even though both understood language, one monopolized speech, while the other was mute. That's why the patient seemed normal to family and friends.

Pondering such split-brain cases, some scientists and philosophers have raised a disquieting possibility: perhaps each of us really consists of two minds running in harness. In an intact brain, of course, the corpus callosum acts as a constant two-way internal-communications channel between the two hemispheres. So our everyday behavior does not betray the existence of two independent streams of consciousness flowing along within our skulls. It may be, the philosopher Thomas Nagel has written, that ''the ordinary, simple idea of a single person will come to seem quaint some day, when the complexities of the human control system become clearer and we become less certain that there is anything very important that we are one of.''

It is sobering to reflect how ignorant humans have been about the workings of their own brains for most of our history. Aristotle, after all, thought the point of the brain was to cool the blood. The more that breakthroughs like the recent one in brain-scanning open up the mind to scientific scrutiny, the more we may be pressed to give up comforting metaphysical ideas like interiority, subjectivity and the soul. Let's enjoy them while we can.

	Human Flu Transfers May Exceed Reports


In the wake of a cluster of avian flu cases that killed seven members of a rural Indonesian family, it appears likely that there have been many more human-to-human infections than the authorities have previously acknowledged.

The numbers are still relatively small, and they do not mean that the virus has mutated to pass easily between people -- a change that could touch off a worldwide epidemic. All the clusters of cases have been among relatives or in nurses who were in long, close contact with patients.

But the clusters -- in Indonesia, Thailand, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iraq and Vietnam -- paint a grimmer picture of the virus's potential to pass from human to human than is normally described by public health officials, who usually say such cases are ''rare.''

Until recently, World Health Organization representatives have said there were only two or three such cases. On May 24 Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, estimated that there had been ''at least three.'' Then, last Tuesday, Maria Cheng, a W.H.O. spokeswoman, said there were ''probably about half a dozen.'' She added, ''I don't think anybody's got a solid number.''

And Dr. Angus Nicoll, chief of flu activities at the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, acknowledged that ''we are probably underestimating the extent of person-to-person transmission.''

The handful of cases usually cited, he said, are ''just the open-and-shut ones,'' like the infections of nurses in the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak and of a Bangkok office worker who died in 2004 after tending her daughter who fell sick on an aunt's farm.

Most clusters are hard to investigate, he said, because they may not even be noticed until a victim is hospitalized, and are often in remote villages where people fear talking. Also, he said, by the time doctors from Geneva arrive to take samples, local authorities ''have often killed all the chickens and covered everything with lime.''

The W.H.O. is generally conservative in its announcements and, as a United Nations agency, is sometimes limited by member states in what it is permitted to say about them.

Still, several scientists have noted that there are many clusters in which human-to-human infection may be a more logical explanation than the idea that relatives who fell sick days apart got the virus from the same dying bird.

For example, in a letter published last November in Emerging Infectious Diseases analyzing 15 family clusters from 2003 through mid-2005 in Southeast Asia, scientists from the disease control centers, the W.H.O. and several Asian health ministries noted that four clusters had gaps of more than seven days between the time family members got sick. They questioned conventional wisdom that only one, the Bangkok office worker, was ''likely'' human-to-human.

In one Vietnam cluster, not only did a young man, his teenage sister and 80-year-old grandfather test positive for A(H5N1) avian flu, but two nurses tending them developed severe pneumonia, and one tested positive.

In another questionable case, the Vietnamese government's assertion that a man developed the flu 16 days after eating raw duck-blood pudding was publicly ridiculed by a prominent flu specialist at Hong Kong University, who said it was more likely that he got it from his sick brother.

Dr. Henry L. Niman, a biochemist in Pittsburgh who has become a hero to many Internet flu watchers and a gadfly to public health authorities, has argued for weeks that there have been 20 to 30 human-to-human infections.

Dr. Niman says the authors of the Emerging Infectious Diseases article were too conservative: even though the dates in it were fragmentary, it was possible to infer that in about 10 of the 15 cases, there was a gap in onset dates of at least five days, which would fit with the flu's incubation time of two to five days.

And in a study published just last month about a village in Azerbaijan, scientists from the W.H.O. and the United States Navy said human-to-human transmission was possible. That conclusion essentially agreed with what Dr. Niman had been arguing since early March -- that it was unlikely that seven infections among six relatives and a neighbor, with onset dates stretching from Feb. 15 to March 4, had all been picked up from dying wild swans that the family had plucked for feathers in a nearby swamp in early February.

While Dr. Niman is an irritant to public health officials, his digging sometimes pushes them to change conclusions, as it did in the recent Indonesia case. The W.H.O. at first said an undercooked pig might have infected the whole family, but Dr. Niman discovered that the hostess of the barbecue was sick two days before the barbecue and the last relative was infected two weeks after it.

His prodding, picked up by journalists, eventually led the W.H.O. to concede that no pig was to blame and that the virus probably had jumped from human to human to human.

The health organization's periodic updates on the number of avian flu cases and the death toll concentrate on cases confirmed by laboratories. The updates use no names and are often cleared by the affected country's health minister.

Dr. Niman, by contrast, trolls local press and radio reports and uses Google software to translate them -- sometimes hilariously -- looking for family names, onset dates and death dates.

For example, a May 15 report quotes a village midwife named Spoilt describing the death of a woman in Kubu Sembilang, Indonesia and the hospitalization of one of her sons:

''Praise br Ginting experienced was sick to last April 27 2006, with the sign of the continuous high fever to the temperature of his body reached 390 C was accompanied by coughs Added Spoilt, second casualties Roy Karo-Karo that also the son of the uterus from Praise br. Gintin after his mother died last May 3, also fell ill, afterwards was reconciled to RSU Kabanjahe.''

Dr. Niman contends that the largest human-to-human cluster so far was not in Indonesia, but in Dogubayazit, Turkey, in January. W.H.O. updates recorded 12 infected in three clusters, and quoted the Turkish Health Ministry blaming chickens and ducks. Dr. Niman counted 30 hospitalized with symptoms and said the three clusters were all cousins with the last names of Kocyigit and Ozcan, and that most fell sick after a big family party on Dec. 24 that was attended by a teenager who fell sick on Dec. 18 and died Jan. 1.

A patriarch, Dr. Niman said, told local papers that the two branches had had dinner together six days after the 14-year-old, Mehmet Ali Kocyigit, had shown mild symptoms. He died on Jan. 1, and several other young members of the two families died shortly after, with other relatives showing symptoms until Jan. 16. No scientific study of that outbreak has been released.

Dr. Niman also said clusters were becoming more frequent, especially in Indonesia. Just last week two more emerged there, one including a nurse whose infection has not yet been confirmed. With 36 deaths, Indonesia is expected to eclipse Vietnam soon as the world's worst-hit country.

Dr. David Nabarro, chief pandemic flu coordinator for the United Nations, said that even if some unexplained cases were human-to-human, it does not yet mean that the pandemic alert system, now at Level 3, ''No or very limited human-human transmission,'' should be raised to Level 4, ''Increased human-human transmission.''

Level 4 means the virus has mutated until it moves between some people who have been only in brief contact, as a cold does. Right now, Dr. Nabarro said, any human transmission is ''very inefficient.''

Level 6, meaning a pandemic has begun, is defined as ''efficient and sustained'' human transmission.

Ms. Cheng of the W.H.O. said that even if there were more clusters, the alert would remain at Level 3 as long as the virus dies out by itself.

''A lot of this is subjective, a judgment on how efficiently the virus is infecting people,'' she said. ''If it becomes more common, we'd convene a task force to raise the alert level.''

	W.H.O. to Study Bird Flu Deaths in Family


A team of World Health Organization experts has been deployed to help investigate what is being termed a worrisome family cluster of human cases of avian influenza in northern Indonesia, organization officials said yesterday.

''The leading hypothesis'' right now is that the disease spread among family members after extremely close contact with ill relatives, said Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.

But International health officials emphasized that laboratory tests from the family did not suggest that the A(H5N1) bird flu virus had mutated in any way that would allow it to spread among humans more readily, which scientists have said could set off a devastating worldwide pandemic.

While the virus has killed hundreds of millions of birds in the past several years, it is poorly adapted to humans and has only infected 214 people, almost always those who had had close contact with sick birds.

''Certainly this is the largest cluster we have in humans, and that by itself it worrying,'' said Dick Thompson, a W.H.O. official who arrived in Indonesia yesterday to join the seven-member team. ''There's a suggestion of human-to-human transmission, and that is worrying.''

He said United Nations investigators would study the travels of the Indonesian family over the last month to see whether they had visited places like markets that had put them at risk, or whether they might have passed the disease on to others.

People deemed to have serious exposure would be given anti-flu medicines and perhaps placed in quarantine if ill, he said.

He said that it would probably take a while to decide whether human-to-human transmission had occurred, because that determination was largely made by process of elimination, and that the W.H.O. team would have to investigate ''all the other alternatives.''

Scientists have long acknowledged that human-to-human transmission through extremely close contact might be possible. In a very few cases health officials suspect that a person extremely ill with the disease may have passed it to a family member, like a mother and child who shared a bed. But that is different from the kind of spread through casual contact that would occur in an pandemic.

Recent research has demonstrated that one of the reasons avian influenza does not spread easily among humans is that it infects cells deep in the human lungs.

So for transmission to occur, there must be intense and prolonged exposure to someone with a deep cough, doctors suggest. Normal human influenza virus lives in the throat and nose, and so spreads readily from sneezes. No evidence suggests that the A(H5N1) avian influenza virus was poised to acquire that ability.

Some human transmission is suspected in the Indonesian cluster because the family members did not keep birds and were not from a village with a known avian influenza outbreak. But potential routes of exposure are numerous in rural areas of Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, which has been struggling to control the disease.

At least some members of the stricken family sold produce at a market where birds are slaughtered, a health official said, and could have contracted the disease there.

One family member got sick, died and was buried without being tested. She is believed to have infected six relatives, all confirmed to have had bird flu. Five of them died. Before dying, one of the children infected his father, who died Monday.

No cases have been reported in the village outside of the family. Such cases would suggest that the disease had become more easily transmissible.

''There are no cases in health care workers or members of the community -- that is the good news,'' Dr. Gerberding said. She emphasized that even if human-to-human transmission had occurred in the family, it was most likely caused by ''the kind of close contact family members have with loved ones'' who are ill.

Juan Lubroth, a senior veterinarian at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, said his group's investigation had found no ''indication at all that animals are involved in this transmission.'' But he, too, cautioned that poorly regulated markets for live birds still functioned in Indonesia, and the investigation is continuing.

''It has been a difficult situation because of Indonesia's decentralized government system,'' Dr. Lubroth said. ''There is a national strategy but it's too early to say how it's panning out.''

	Missile Contractor Doctored Tests, Ex-Employee Charges


A former senior engineer at TRW, a top military contractor, has charged the company with faking tests and evaluations of a key component for the proposed $27 billion antimissile system and then firing her when she protested.

The engineer, Dr. Nira Schwartz, was on the company's antimissile team in 1995 and 1996 helping design computer programs meant to enable interceptors to distinguish between incoming warheads and decoys. In test after test, the interceptors failed, she has alleged, but her superiors insisted that the technology performed adequately, refused her appeals to tell industrial partners and federal patrons of its shortcomings, and then fired her.

Dr. Schwartz has made her charges in interviews and in newly unsealed documents filed with a federal district court in Los Angeles, where nearly four years ago she sued TRW. She seeks to recover for the government more than a half-billion dollars, some part of which a judge could award her as compensation.

In interviews and court filings, TRW has vigorously denied the charges. But citing the pending litigation, it has refused to address many details of the accusations.

Right or wrong, the investigations surrounding Dr. Schwartz's claims are shedding light on a contentious and secretive program. The Clinton administration has said it will decide this summer whether to proceed with an antimissile system meant to defend against warheads from so-called rogue states. Russia and other countries warn that such a decision could undermine a treaty limiting antimissile defenses that has served as a pillar of arms control.

In 1998 the Pentagon rejected the TRW interceptor as the leading antimissile candidate in favor of a rival design by Raytheon. However, it is still a backup and could win the lead role since the Raytheon design has stumbled in recent flights.

Dr. Schwartz's charges have split the Defense Department. Some top officials defend TRW as innocent, and the Justice Department has so far declined to join her lawsuit. But a three-year inquiry by the Pentagon's Defense Criminal Investigative Service, which ended last August with no action, cited in its final report ''numerous technical discrepancies'' that ''appear to warrant further review.''

Moreover, former TRW employees back Dr. Schwartz. In an affidavit filed in connection with her suit, Roy Danchick, a retired senior engineer at TRW, said he had firsthand knowledge of TRW's ''impermissibly manipulating'' a study of the antimissile technology and ''censoring the test data'' so it appeared more successful than it was.

Dr. Schwartz's allegations center on TRW's certifying to the government that interceptors using its computer programs would succeed more than 95 percent of the time in picking out enemy warheads, even if they were hidden in a confusing blur of decoys in space. In fact, Dr. Schwartz said in court documents, the interceptors could do so only 5 to 15 percent of the time.

Her charges are coming to light now because many secret court filings have been unsealed at her request and she is seeking public support for her case.

Dr. Schwartz, 53, a naturalized United States citizen from Israel, has a Ph.D. in engineering from Tel Aviv University and holds 18 United States patents, including ones involving computerized image analysis and pattern recognition.

TRW hired her to help develop computerized algorithms that are meant to enable an interceptor to differentiate between real and fake warheads by matching memories of threatening images against a rush of incoming sensor data.

Dr. Schwartz said in an interview that in time she had concluded that all the current discrimination technologies were too feeble to work and that at some level the Pentagon and its contractors were in collusion.

''It's not a defense of the United States,'' she said, eyes flashing. ''It's a conspiracy to allow them to milk the government. They are creating for themselves a job for life.''

According to court records, Dr. Schwartz was hired as a senior engineer by TRW on Sept. 5, 1995, joining the company's space group in Redondo Beach, Calif. TRW was allied with Rockwell (later bought by Boeing amid defense consolidations) in a competition to build a ''kill vehicle,'' which would zoom into space atop rockets and smash enemy warheads to pieces. The work for which Dr. Schwartz was hired, enabling the kill vehicle to spot enemy targets, represented the soul of the machine.

''She is almost uniquely qualified to strengthen the interplay'' among TRW specialists pursuing image analysis and object recognition, her boss wrote personnel officials after she was hired.

Among her jobs was to help assess a kill-vehicle program called the Kalman Feature Extractor. From incoming sensor data, the extractor was to find critical characteristics of scanned objects, teasing out familiar ''signatures'' that could separate decoys from warheads.

TRW executives believed the extractor offered a competitive edge over the rival industrial team (then Hughes, later bought by Raytheon), and they told the government it was a potential breakthrough.

Familiar with the extractor from previous research, including that for her patents of 1983 and 1989, Dr. Schwartz proceeded to test it against nearly 200 types of enemy decoys and warheads in computer simulations, using secret intelligence data.

''The moment I analyzed the signatures,'' she said in an interview, ''I saw there was a problem.'' Most of the time, she said, the kill vehicle's extractor program failed to distinguish between warheads and decoys because their identifying signatures differed wildly depending on variables like spin, attitude, temperature, wobble, deployment angle and time of day and year.

''For every RV there was a decoy'' that produced an identical signature, Dr. Schwartz said, referring to a warhead as a reentry vehicle, or RV.

The variations she used in the tests, she added, were not arbitrary but spelled out in the Pentagon's antimissile bible, the 1993 ''Technical Requirements Document.''

The results were roughly the same, Dr. Schwartz said, with the math tool failing about 90 percent of the time, when she tested TRW's less sophisticated method for separating wheat from chaff, known as the baseline algorithm.

In interviews and court documents, Dr. Schwartz said she told her boss and colleagues of her discoveries. ''They said not to worry,'' she recalled. Flight tests of mock objects, she said she was told, would always be arranged so discrimination would be relatively easy.

When she pressed her superiors to tell industrial partners and the military of the shortcomings, especially of the extractor, the purported star of the show, they refused, according to court documents. Days later, in late February 1996, she was fired.

''If you will not notify the U.S. Government,'' she warned TRW in a furious letter after the firing, ''then I will.''

Robert D. Hughes, her former boss, expressed no regrets. In company documents, he told colleagues that Dr. Schwartz had been completely off target, quick with her diatribes yet misreading her own tests and TRW's process of product development. The extractor was not finished but evolving.

''Stating that there is a 'defect' that we should immediately report to the customer makes no sense,'' Mr. Hughes told his boss in a March 1, 1996, letter. ''We continually improve and verify system performance.''

Mr. Hughes added that the extractor ''appears to perform properly under all conditions that have been specified to us'' by the government and fails only when flight environments are ''highly improbable'' and ''appear not to be within our requirements.''

Dr. Schwartz contacted federal investigators, and on April 29, 1996, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles a lawsuit under the false claims act that sought to recover damages for the government. The suit was kept under seal. It alleged that TRW had ''knowingly and falsely certified'' discrimination technology that was ''incapable of performing its intended purpose.''

By June, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service had opened an inquiry out of its  field office in Mission Viejo, Calif. The investigative service, an arm of the Pentagon's inspector general, is a federal law enforcement agency that can make arrests and subpoena documents.

The lead investigator, Samuel W. Reed Jr., interviewed Dr. Schwartz, military experts, TRW officials and a network of informers. The Justice Department monitored the case. Under the law, it could choose to join Dr. Schwartz's lawsuit, which would raise her chances of winning.

Meanwhile, a $100 million test was nearing; it would help determine whether Dr. Schwartz's charges were plausible. For the first time, a kill vehicle under development in the program would be shot into space to see if it could discriminate between a warhead and decoys.

Despite the long work on the extractor,  TRW decided to abandon it and rely on the backup, the baseline algorithm. TRW told the military that the extractor was simply too big for the kill vehicle's computer, but court documents suggest that by then it was widely regarded as a failure.

On June 23, 1997, the mock enemy missile -- containing the cone-shaped target warhead, six balloons and three decoy warheads -- was launched from California and sped southwest. Twenty minutes later, the interceptor was fired from a Pacific atoll, its computer brain ready to try to discern the target warhead. The test was to be a simple flyby, with no effort at interception.

The Pentagon hailed the test publicly as an outstanding success, but privately, analysts were dismayed. Even with all the coaching, the computer brain of the kill vehicle had selected a decoy, Dr. Schwartz and other experts said in interviews.

Undaunted, TRW found good news, as Mr. Danchick, the former senior TRW engineer, later told Pentagon investigators, when data beamed back from the kill vehicle was later reworked. In a postflight analysis meant to mimic the real thing, TRW managers interrupted the analysis to select a more favorable stream of data for the baseline algorithm to digest, Mr. Danchick told the investigators. Then, finally, the program zeroed in on the warhead -- a point hammered home in a vivid company graphic.

This was what Mr. Danchick later called in the affidavit TRW's ''impermissibly manipulating'' test results. Officials at TRW and in the government will not say if the government back then learned of these acts, though the company in a recent statement said it ''categorically denies that it misrepresented or improperly manipulated any flight test data.''

In any event, Mr. Reed, the Pentagon investigator, became convinced that the matter warranted close scrutiny, as he detailed in more than a dozen reports and letters later filed in the court case. He also noted that TRW was the antimissile program's overall system engineer, with responsibilities to ''analyze and validate results'' of all flight tests, and thus had a potential conflict of interest.

By this time, Mr. Reed's talks with military officials had produced a scientific analysis of Dr. Schwartz's charges. Nichols Research of Huntsville, Ala., a regular adviser to the antimissile program, found in December 1997 that TRW's discrimination work was ''no Nobel Prize winner'' but met contract requirements. It added that TRW had failed to answer many questions.

Mr. Reed then asked Pentagon officials for a deeper study, which was done in 1998 and delivered late that year. The five scientists for the study were drawn from a high-level antimissile advisory board with Pentagon ties dating back to the Reagan ''Star Wars'' era.

The new study team found the baseline algorithm ''basically sound'' but questioned some of its purported strengths. For instance, it showed that small changes in planned sensor data greatly lowered the odds of selecting the right target. Importantly, it blessed TRW's manipulating some data from the first flight test, saying a computer program was being developed that, if perfected, would do the same in space automatically.

As for the abandoned extractor, TRW's onetime star, the new team said dismissively that its ''application to discrimination may be limited.''

Though equivocal, that study was enough for the Justice Department. Three years after Dr. Schwartz's initial charge, it declined to join her false-claims litigation.

But it hardly ended the story. In a memorandum dated March 15, Mr. Reed asserted that the Army had falsely reported to the Justice Department that he was against federal intervention. ''This statement has no factual basis,'' he seethed.

Mr. Reed formally closed his investigation of TRW on Aug. 31, 1999, citing numerous ''irregularities'' and ''discrepancies.'' Shortly thereafter, colleagues said, he retired from the Pentagon's police force.

A federal official unconnected to the Pentagon but familiar with the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, faulted the military's two scientific studies of Dr. Schwartz's charges as biased. ''They don't go biting the hand that feeds them,'' he said of the antimissile advisory groups. He added that the studies had enough of the appearance of impartiality to dissuade the Justice Department from entering her case.

Meanwhile, Dr. Schwartz has added to her antimissile criticism. Her investigations had shown that the Pentagon planned to use up to nine decoys in interception flight tests. But when it actually performed the tests last October and this January, each flight had but one decoy balloon. In an interview, she attributed this simplification to the military's belated discovery of fraud and how hard the job actually was.

TRW, though spared a federal assault by the Justice Department's decision, fared poorly in the investigations. In May 1998, its industrial team lost a bid to become the antimissile system's ''lead system integrator,'' a post worth $1.6 billion over three years. Simultaneously, the company also lost its system engineer status. In December 1998, its team lost the competition to build the kill vehicle. The prize was won by Raytheon, a relative newcomer to the field that developed its own discrimination software and is now struggling with problems uncovered in recent flight tests.

Last October, the Pentagon hailed the Raytheon test as an unqualified success. But it later acknowledged that the kill vehicle had initially drifted off course and picked out a decoy balloon rather than the warhead.

In a January test, the interceptor missed the target altogether.

Dr. Schwartz lives with her husband, an aerospace engineer, in a two-bedroom town house in a gated community in Torrance, Calif., and runs computers for a plastics company. After representing herself in her case against TRW for years, Dr. Schwartz recently retained David W. Affeld, a Los Angeles lawyer with a bachelor's degree in physics. She has filed a wrongful termination action against TRW. And she still, despite the ups and downs, wants the government to join her false-claims suit.

Keith Englander, director of system engineering for the Pentagon's antimissile program, echoing TRW, said the two studies had discredited Dr. Schwartz. Any problems with the company's discrimination work, he added, were a normal part of the engineering design process.

He also defended his program against her wider criticisms, saying flight tests were never rigged and results never doctored.

The reduction on interception tests from numerous decoys to just one, Mr. Englander said, was because the government had cut the program's goal from trying to knock out advanced warheads from countries like Russia and China to more primitive ones from rogue states.

''Another objective,'' he added, ''is to walk before we run. When you start, you don't go to the most stressing environment.''

The Pentagon is sharply divided on such issues. Last month in a public report, Philip E. Coyle 3rd, the Defense Department's director of testing and evaluation, faulted the antimissile tests as insufficiently realistic ''to support acquisition decisions.''

	Panel Recommends Ending Satellite Plan


At the urging of its Republican leadership, the House Appropriations Committee is recommending canceling an expensive infrared satellite system that the Pentagon considers vital to missile defense.

The satellites are intended to track ballistic missiles as they soar through the atmosphere, providing data that would help interceptor missiles tell missiles from decoys and  home in on and destroy warheads.

The Pentagon had proposed putting two dozen such satellites, at an estimated cost of $11 billion to $20 billion, into low orbits above the earth over the next two decades to provide continuous surveillance against missile attacks.

But in a report that has yet to be voted on by the full House, the Appropriations Committee contends that the satellite program is over its budget and behind schedule. It also cites an internal Pentagon study that questions the effectiveness of the satellites in discriminating between warheads and decoys.

Noting that ground-based radar might be a less expensive alternative to the satellites, the committee recommended denying the Bush administration's entire request of $385 million for the satellite program in the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. Instead, the committee proposed transferring most of that money to other satellite and radar programs.

''This was not ready to move forward,'' said Jim Specht, a spokesman for Representative Jerry Lewis, a California Republican who is chairman of the Pentagon subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee.

''By taking away the funding, the committee is making clear they need to do more development and testing of this system in order for it to become an integral part of national missile defense,'' Mr. Specht added.

But Pentagon officials said that canceling or sharply cutting the satellite program would be a major setback to the Bush administration's missile defense plan.

''It would degrade the future capability of the overall missile defense program,'' said Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.

''Ground-based systems are limited by the curvature of the earth,'' Colonel Lehner added. ''They don't have the range of a space-based system, which can cover the whole planet.''

Congressional officials said the fate of the satellite program before the full House and in the Senate was unclear. The Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to reduce the program by $96.6 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee has yet to vote on the Pentagon spending bills.

The satellites, known as the space-based infrared system-low, are being developed by two competing teams,  one led by TRW and Raytheon, the other by Spectrum Astro and Northrop Grumman.

The system had its roots in the  Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative, when it was known as Brilliant Eyes. Using infrared sensors, the satellites are intended to locate warheads when they reach the mid-course of their trajectory, sending back to earth data that would help ground-based radars and interceptor rockets to fix on a threatening warhead.

Proponents contend that the satellites would be valuable not just for tracking long-range nuclear-tipped missiles, but also short-range weapons, known as theater missiles, that could be fired at American troops overseas.

''It's an essential component if ballistic missile defenses are to work effectively,'' said Representative John Spratt, a South Carolina Democrat who supports the program. ''Not just for national missile defense, but also theater missile defense.''

Pentagon officials have often cited the infrared satellites in responding to critics who contend that a missile shield would be easily fooled by decoys released alongside warheads in space. By identifying the difference in temperature between a decoy and warhead, the satellites would, in theory, be able to guide an interceptor toward the real target, the Pentagon contends.

Critics of missile defense question whether any system would be effective in picking out decoys. But they concede that a missile defense is likely to be more effective with the infrared satellites than without them.

''The job of the attacker is easier if there is not a S.B.I.R.S.-low system,'' said Lisbeth Gronlund, senior staff scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an arms control group.

But over the years, the satellite program has been repeatedly criticized by Congressional investigators and Pentagon testers.

In a report released in February, the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigative arm, asserted that the satellite program was being rushed and was likely to face technical failures and major cost overruns.

The investigators found, for example, that the Pentagon was proposing to launch the first satellites before critical software had been completed.

''The S.B.I.R.S.-low program is at high risk of not delivering the system on time or at cost or with expected performance,'' the report concluded.

	The Alchemy of OxyContin


Paula is taking me on a driving tour of Man, the tiny West Virginia town where she has spent her entire life. Because I don't know my way around the hollows and gullies and creeks that carve through these hills, Paula is at the wheel. And because Paula isn't a morning person, we've set out on our tour at midnight. It's dark; the only illumination comes from our headlights cutting through the mist that rolls down from the hills.

The tour Paula is leading isn't sanctioned by the local chamber of commerce; there are no stops at Civil War plaques or scenic vistas. It's a pillhead tour: an addict's-eye view of the radical changes that a single prescription drug, called OxyContin, has brought to the town of Man. OxyContin abuse started in remote communities like this one more than two years ago; more recently, it has spread beyond its origins in Appalachia and rural Maine to affect cities and suburbs across the eastern United States. I came to Man to try to understand how America's latest drug problem started, to see its roots and trace how it has spread.

''That's my best friend's trailer right there,'' Paula says, pointing out a comfortable-looking single-wide across the creek. ''She's somebody that you couldn't

look at and know she was an oxy addict. She was a cheerleader in junior high. She's married. You can't just look at somebody and tell.''

A few years ago, Paula says, Man was like any small town in America: you could buy a variety of illegal drugs, as long as you knew the right person to talk to. Pot was big; there was occasionally some cocaine around and a few pills for recreational use. Fads would come and go. But these days, she says, the only drug for sale in Man is OxyContin, a narcotic painkiller that users crush -- to disable its patented time-release mechanism -- and then snort or inject for a powerful and immediate opiate high. Legally, it's sold only by prescription for the treatment of chronic pain. In practice it's available just about everywhere around here, immediately, for cash. The going rate is a dollar a milligram, or $40 for a 40-milligram pill.

Paula is a thoughtful, good-natured 24-year-old with wispy blond hair, serious eyes and faded jeans. She's fidgety; as she drives with one hand, she's rummaging through her handbag with the other, looking for her pack of Marlboro Lights. She finds them, removes one and stabs the dashboard lighter. ''I'll show you some places over here,'' she says, as she turns her car off the main road, over a short bridge and down into a rough indentation that holds a couple dozen trailers and prefab homes. ''This is Green Valley. We just call it the valley. It's a pretty good neighborhood,'' she says, then interrupts herself. ''Well, except that's a dealer there.''

She points to a trailer with a Chevy pickup out front and a light burning inside. I crane my neck to get a look at a real-life drug den, but the tour has already moved on. Paula is pointing out a trailer on the other side of the road: ''That's a small-time dealer there, nothing big,'' she says. Then she points to another one, and then another: ''That's a dealer. . . . That's a small-time dealer. . . . That's a dealer. . . . Her son's a dealer, but I don't know if he lives there. . . . He uses, that boy in there. . . . They use really, really big.''

We're driving slowly around the circular dirt road that is the only path through Green Valley. The neighborhood doesn't feel dangerous -- no graffiti, no pit bulls, no broken bottles lying around. Still, Paula is pointing out criminal activity in every second home, peering through the front windshield and gesturing left and right: ''They used to deal, too, but they don't no more. . . . They deal. . . . There's some dealers up through there, one or two, nothing big. . . . This boy that lives here deals. . . . They deal, in that trailer there.''

The first time Paula did an oxy (as she calls the pills), in the summer of 1999, it didn't do much for her. ''That first 10-milligram pill, I didn't really feel nothing off it,'' she says. ''But the second time I did it, I did two 20's, and I was high.'' She liked the effect. ''When you get that oxy buzz,'' she says, ''it's a great feeling. You're happy. Your body don't hurt. Nothing can bring you down. It's a high to where you don't have to think about nothing. All your troubles go away. You just feel like everything is lifted off your shoulders.''

What Paula calls ''that oxy buzz'' comes from OxyContin's only active ingredient: oxycodone, an opioid, or synthetic opiate, developed in a German laboratory in 1916. Chemically, it is a close relative of every other opium derivative and synthetic: heroin, morphine, codeine, fentanyl, methadone. The narcotic effects that Paula is describing are the exact same ones that have drawn people to opiates for centuries. And just as every opiate does, oxycodone creates a physical dependence in most of its users and a powerful addiction in some of them. ''At first you do them to get high,'' Paula says, ''and then after you're addicted to them you don't do them to get high; you do them to survive. You do them to feel normal.'' At her peak, she says, she was snorting four or five 80-milligram pills a day.

The earliest reported cases of Oxycontin abuse were in rural Maine, rust-belt counties in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio and the Appalachian areas of Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. The problem traveled through these regions, as friends told friends and the word spread from town to town, county to county, up and down the Appalachians. There are a few defining characteristics that the first affected regions share: they're home to large populations of disabled and chronically ill people who are in need of pain relief; they're marked by high unemployment and a lack of economic opportunity; they're remote, far from the network of Interstates and metropolises through which heroin and cocaine travel; and they're areas where prescription drugs have been abused -- though in much smaller numbers -- in the past. ''There's always been a certain degree of prescription drug abuse in this area,'' says Art Van Zee, a physician in Lee County, Va., ''but there's never been anything like this. This is something that is very different and very new, and we don't understand all the reasons why. This is not just people who have long-term substance-abuse problems. In our region this is young teenagers, 13- and 14-year-olds, experimenting with recreational drug use and rapidly becoming addicted. Tens of thousands of opioid addicts are being created out there.''

In Man, Paula said, it was like OxyContin came out of nowhere. One day no one had heard of oxys, and a month later, the pills had become a way of life for hundreds of locals. It became so easy to buy OxyContin in and around Man, Paula said, that until recently, she never really thought about the fact that everyone involved was breaking the law. ''Buying pills never seemed illegal,'' she said. ''It just didn't feel like it was wrong.'' There aren't lookouts involved, or secret passwords or elaborate drop sites: when Paula wants to buy an OxyContin pill, she simply drives to a dealer's house and knocks on the front door in broad daylight. If she knows the dealer well enough, she'll go on in and snort the pill there, just to be neighborly. If not, she'll hand over the cash, put the pill in her pocket and drive away. Sometimes she'll be the only person there; other times, there will be a dozen cars lined up out front.

The dealers have the benefit of a captive market: OxyContin, like any opioid, is very difficult to quit abusing. And given the pill's ubiquity here in Man, and the fact that the nearest rehab clinic is two hours away, this is an unusually hard place to quit using it. Nonetheless, Paula is trying. Six months ago, she and her best friend decided they were going to quit cold turkey. They took a couple of days off work, locked themselves in her friend's trailer and started to detox. ''That was the worst three days of my life,'' Paula said. ''Honestly, I prayed to God to let me die. That's how bad it is. Your stomach hurts, you get really bad headaches, you get diarrhea. You want to throw up. You get really depressed. If you can get past the third day or the fourth day, you're pretty much fine, but most people don't make it.'' Paula and her friend didn't make it: at the end of the third day, they went out and got a pill.

A few months ago, OxyContin abuse was considered a regional problem, labeled ''hillbilly heroin'' and confined to areas far from the nation's population centers. This year, though, abuse of OxyContin has started to move away from its backwoods origins and into metropolitan areas on the East Coast, into the Deep South and parts of the Southwest and into suburban communities throughout the Eastern United States. In Miami-Dade County, there have been 11 overdose deaths so far this year in which oxycodone was the probable cause, according to the county medical examiner. There have been 11 more in Philadelphia, according to the medical examiner there. Police in Bridgeport, Conn., arrested a local doctor in July for prescribing tens of thousands of OxyContin tablets to patients, often, they say, without any medical examination at all. And in the suburbs of Boston, police say more than a dozen pharmacies have been held up by a gang of young men wearing baseball caps and bandannas, looking for OxyContin.

In many ways, the spread of Oxycontin abuse closely resembles another recent drug epidemic. In the early 1990's, the Medellín and Cali cartels controlled cocaine and heroin distribution in the United States. Cocaine was selling well, but there was a marketing problem with heroin: it could only be injected, and many people, even frequent drug abusers, are reluctant to stick needles in their arms.

The Colombians' solution to this problem was to increase the purity of the heroin they were bringing into the United States until it was potent enough to snort. They were then able to use their existing cocaine-trafficking network in the Eastern United States to get heroin onto the street in powder form. Cocaine users, who were used to the idea of buying and snorting a white powder, experimented and became addicted. As their tolerance increased, these new heroin snorters overcame their aversion to needles and soon turned into heroin injectors.

Similarly, there were plenty of oxycodone users in Appalachia before OxyContin came along. Many of the OxyContin addicts I spoke to in Kentucky and West Virginia used to snort or chew a mild oxycodone-based painkiller called Tylox. They said they found the pills somewhat euphoric and not very addictive -- each Tylox contains just 5 milligrams of oxycodone, along with 500 milligrams of acetaminophen. When OxyContin arrived on the scene, in pills containing 20, 40 and 80 milligrams of oxycodone, it marked a jump in purity similar to that of early-90's heroin -- and again, casual users started snorting, and then shooting, a powerful opioid.

Although heroin and OxyContin have a similar unhappy effect on the lives of people addicted to them, there is a critical and simple difference between the two: heroin is illegal; OxyContin, when used as directed, is legal. More than that: the pill is government-approved. It is made by Purdue Pharma, a successful and well-regarded pharmaceutical company headquartered in Stamford, Conn. It is prescribed to a million patients for the treatment of chronic pain, and it is closely regulated at every stage of its manufacture and distribution by the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

This fact has meant a major conceptual shift for law-enforcement officials, who are used to combating narcotics produced by international drug lords, not international corporations. Terry Woodworth, the deputy director of the D.E.A.'s office of diversion control, says the spread of OxyContin has posed a challenge to the D.E.A.'s traditional methods: ''Instead of using the normal law-enforcement techniques -- like going to the source and attempting to eradicate or destroy the criminal organization producing the drug and immobilize its distribution networks and seize all its assets -- you have a very different situation in a legitimate industry, in that your manufacture and distribution is legal.''

Scott Walker, the director of Layne House, a drug treatment facility in Prestonsburg, Ky., puts it more concisely: ''You don't have the Coast Guard chasing OxyContin ships,'' he says. ''This isn't something you can stop at the border. It's growing from within.''

Part of what makes the spread of OxyContin abuse so difficult to track, let alone to stop, is that the drug moves not physically but conceptually. When crack cocaine spread from the big cities on either coast toward the center of the country, it traveled gradually, along Interstates, city by city. OxyContin abuse pops up suddenly, in unexpected locations: Kenai, Alaska; Tucson; West Palm Beach, Fla. At the Gateway Rehabilitation Center in Aliquippa, Pa., a suburb of Pittsburgh, Jay, a recovering OxyContin addict and a former small-time dealer, offered an explanation for OxyContin's sudden geographical shifts. ''It's the idea that passes on,'' he told me. ''That's how it spreads. There aren't mules running the drug across the country. It's dealt by word of mouth. I call a friend in Colorado and explain it to him: 'Hey, I've got this crazy pill, an OC 80, an OC 40. You've got to go to the doctor and get it. Tell him your back hurts.'''

Jay is 26, a college graduate and former nurse. He started doing oxys in 1999, and his consumption quickly rose to 240 milligrams a day. He was clean when we met and trying to stay that way. But when he talked about the drug's potential as a small business, he couldn't help getting excited. ''I could go to California or Las Vegas and say, 'Hey, I was getting OC's prescribed to me in Pennsylvania; I'm going to get them in Las Vegas,''' he said. ''And then if I wanted to sell them, I could sell them there. I'd start out and sell them for 10 bucks apiece. Get people hooked on them, then sell them for 50 bucks apiece. It's experienced word of mouth. I've experienced the drug, therefore I know how to describe it to you.''

Unlike heroin, Jay explained, OxyContin doesn't require investment or muscle or manpower to move across the country. OxyContin abuse is a a contagious idea -- a meme, if you will. Because OxyContin, the medicine, is readily available in pharmacies everywhere, all it takes to bring OxyContin, the drug, to a new place is a persuasive talker like Jay. A powerful recreational narcotic can now travel halfway across the country in the course of a phone call.

In order to understand the particular dilemma of OxyContin, you need to understand the long-fought war among doctors over pain and addiction. For centuries, opium and its derivatives have been considered a double-edged sword -- the most effective painkiller on earth and also the most addictive substance. For most of the 20th century, opiates were considered too dangerous to use in all but the most critical pain treatments. The assumption was that their medical use would inevitably lead to addiction. In the late 1980's, for the first time, public and medical opinion began to swing decisively in the other direction. Patient advocates and pharmaceutical companies, bolstered by studies showing that there were vast numbers of cancer patients whose pain was being undertreated, encouraged the medical community to rethink its approach to opioids, especially in the management of cancer pain. Their campaign was persuasive. Between 1990 and 1994, morphine consumption in the United States rose by 75 percent, and in 1994, the Department of Health and Human Services issued new clinical guidelines encouraging the use of opioids in the treatment of cancer pain.

Purdue Pharma was a leading player in the pro-opioid campaign. The company contributed generously to patient-advocacy organizations, including the American Pain Foundation, the National Foundation for the Treatment of Pain and the American Chronic Pain Association, and underwrote dozens of scientific studies on the effectiveness of opioids in the treatment of pain. In 1985, the company began marketing MS Contin, a time-release morphine pill that was used to treat cancer pain. As attitudes on opioids shifted, Purdue began to promote MS Contin for noncancer pain as well.

Dr. Russell Portenoy is chairman of pain medicine and palliative care at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, and the co-author of a groundbreaking 1986 study that supported the long-term use of opioids to treat noncancer pain. ''Between 1986 and 1997, within the community of pain specialists, there was increasing attention on the role of opioids,'' Portenoy says, ''but there was relatively little diffusion of that idea to family doctors and other nonspecialists.'' That began to change, Portenoy says, with the F.D.A.'s approval of OxyContin in 1995. ''There was a sea change that occurred with the release of this drug,'' Portenoy says. For the first time, general practitioners began to prescribe strong, long-acting opioids to treat chronic noncancer pain. Portenoy says the change was due to four factors that came together at about the same time. ''The reasons were partly cultural -- the attitudes of the medical and regulatory communities had been gradually shifting for a decade. They were partly medical -- studies had been coming out showing that patients with low back pain, chronic headaches and neuropathic pain might benefit from long-term opioid therapy. They were partly pharmacological -- OxyContin made it easier and more convenient for patients to receive long-term opioid therapy. And they were finally related to marketing, because Purdue Pharma was the first company to advertise an opioid pill to general practitioners in mainstream medical journals.''

In addition to those doctor-directed ads in magazines like The Journal of the American Medical Association, the company began an innovative indirect-marketing campaign just before OxyContin's release. Because of F.D.A. regulations on the marketing of narcotics, the company was unable to use direct-to-consumer advertising, as other pharmaceutical companies were beginning to do for antidepressants and prescription allergy medications. So Purdue decided to concentrate on what they call ''nonbranded education.'' Just as Nike advertises the concept of sports instead of shoes, so Purdue would market the concept of pain relief to consumers, but not OxyContin. In 1994, the company launched Partners Against Pain, a public-education program that at first concentrated on cancer pain and later expanded to include other forms of long-term pain. Through videos, patient pain journals and an elaborate Web site, Purdue promoted three ideas to doctors and patients: that pain was much more widespread than had previously been thought; that it was treatable; and that in many cases it could, and should, be treated with opioids. Partners Against Pain didn't promote OxyContin specifically; the company's marketers knew that simply expanding the total market would also increase their bottom line.

OxyContin was seen by many doctors as the solution to the long rift between pain specialists and addiction specialists. Purdue Pharma believed that OxyContin's time-release function would mean a much lower risk of addiction than other opioid medications. According to a principle known as the ''rate hypothesis,'' the rate at which an opioid enters the brain determines its euphoric effect, and also its addiction potential. This is why injecting a narcotic produces a more powerful high, and addiction risk, than snorting it or swallowing it. Because OxyContin, taken whole, provides a steady flow of oxycodone over an extended period, the high it produces is diminished, as is the risk of addiction.

Before OxyContin, narcotic painkillers were prescribed mostly by oncologists and pain specialists. Purdue believed that OxyContin's time-release safeguards made it appropriate for use by a much broader array of medical professionals. The company began promoting OxyContin to family doctors and local pharmacists nationwide through a network of hundreds of field reps who emphasized, in their office visits, the idea that OxyContin presented a lower addiction risk than other opioid medicines.

Over the next few years, sales of OxyContin exploded. OxyContin prescriptions have more or less doubled in number each year since its release; the company's revenues from the pill jumped to $1.14 billion in 2000 from $55 million in 1996. Last year, doctors wrote more than six and a half million OxyContin prescriptions, and OxyContin ranked as the 18th best-selling prescription drug in the country (as measured by retail sales) and the No. 1 opioid painkiller. The company grew along with its main product's sales; between 1998 and 2000, the Purdue work force expanded to nearly 3,000 employees from 1,600.

Purdue's attempt to expand the opioid marketplace beyond cancer patients was also remarkably successful. Five years ago, cancer patients were still the main market for long-acting opioids, but oncologists accounted for only 3 percent of the OxyContin prescribed last year. The largest single group of OxyContin prescribers is now family physicians, who account for 21 percent of the total.

According to Portenoy, this change in the number and kinds of doctors prescribing OxyContin is fundamentally linked to the spread of OxyContin abuse. ''It's not the drug, per se,'' Portenoy says. ''It's rapidly expanding access, plus the reality of doctors prescribing it who may not have the skill set required to prescribe it responsibly.''

Purdue's field reps were the first wave of OxyContin apostles, spreading word of the pill's effectiveness door to door -- doctor by doctor, pharmacist by pharmacist. But Purdue's officially sanctioned word-of-mouth marketing campaign was followed by another, unsanctioned one. This time the news was that the miracle pill had an Achilles' heel, that its time-release matrix could be eliminated completely in a matter of seconds by the simple act of crushing the pill with a spoon, a lighter, even a thumbnail, and that the resulting powder, when snorted or mixed with water and injected, produced a very potent high. The apostles this time were not Purdue's field reps but casual drug abusers throughout the Eastern United States. And just like Purdue's, their marketing campaign was enormously successful.

In a steel-mill suburb northwest of Pittsburgh, the leader of the second wave of OxyContin apostles was Curt, a young man who in 1998, at the age of 23, found himself kicked out of the Air Force and living back in his hometown. He worked the midnight shift running cranes at the mill, and he dealt a little marijuana during the day. He was part of a ''drug community,'' as he calls it, 20 or so people who worked together, hung out together, went to parties and concerts and smoked a lot of pot. Every couple of months someone would land a prescription for Percocet or Vicodin, and they'd sell the pills to friends for $5 apiece, a cheap and mild high.

In April 1999, someone in his circle was prescribed OxyContin. Curt assumed that it was just like any other pain pill. ''Everybody thought at first that they were like a Percocet,'' Curt says. ''Nobody understood how many milligrams were really in these things. People were selling them like an expensive Percocet'' -- for $10, in other words, instead of $5 -- and swallowing them whole. At a party, Curt figured out the trick of crushing the pill and snorting the powder, and he quickly spread the word. ''I showed a lot of people,'' Curt says. ''At first they were like, 'You're crazy.' But then they'd do it, and that would be it. People tell me now, Yeah, you're the one who showed me how to snort this thing.''

Oxys quickly became very popular in Curt's circle of friends, and Curt found a comfortable niche for himself between supply and demand. ''I knew people all over the county that were getting prescriptions,'' he says. ''They'd call me and say, I'm getting OC's now and I want to get rid of them. They knew there was money there, but they didn't know who to sell to. They usually gave me a heck of a deal. I'd get them all for maybe $10'' per 40-milligram pill. ''I'd sell them for $20, so for every one I sold, I made one. And then I'd give them their money and the next month I'd get their scrip again.'' At that rate, he could make $900 off a 90-pill bottle. But he wasn't in it for the profit; he was in it for the pills. ''I didn't need money,'' he explains. ''I worked at the mill. I was always doing it just for the free drugs.''

Before long, he had 10 people giving him their pills to sell, mostly women in their 30's and 40's on welfare or disability. (Patients on Medicaid pay just a dollar for a $250 OxyContin prescription.) ''It's so weird the people that got into this,'' Curt says. ''Some of them were innocent mothers. I had one that was in her 60's. She never did drugs. She'd sell every last one of her pills, and it would pay for all her other medication.'' Curt would keep careful track of which day of the month each of his suppliers filled her prescription. ''A lot of times I would drive them to the pharmacy,'' he says. ''I'd always get a couple of pills for that.''

One of the most valuable -and closely guarded -- resources in the local OxyContin economy was a doctor who was willing to write an OxyContin prescription without asking too many questions. ''It's a slow process, breaking a doctor in,'' Curt explains. ''You've got to know how to work him. I'd say: 'I can't take the Vicodins and the Percocets because they're hurting my stomach. Do they have anything that's, like, time released?' The doctor goes, 'Oh, you know what, they've got this new stuff called OxyContin.' And I'd say: 'Oh, yeah? Wow, how's that work?''' Some local doctors, Curt says, knew exactly what was going on, but they needed the business. One started handing out monthlong OxyContin prescriptions every two weeks.

On the demand end, Curt had between 25 and 50 steady customers. ''I had a cell phone at that time, so I was doing a lot of driving,'' he says. ''People would gather at their houses, and they'd bring all their friends over, 10 of them that'd use it. They'd all gather when they knew I was coming, because they wanted the pill immediately.''

Curt has been in recovery for a few months now; since he got out of rehab, he's been cut off from almost all his old friends, and he fills his spare time fixing up his sister's house, fishing and reading up on psychology, which he plans to begin studying this fall. He's a man of boundless energy and focus, and he has taken to the 12-step process with an unusual intensity; in his first 60 days clean, he told me, he attended 138 Narcotics Anonymous meetings. That same energy served him well back in his oxy days, when he was cutting steel at the mill all night and driving around making pickups and deliveries all day. The pills themselves, he says, helped him keep going. ''I could go get two hours of sleep, wake up, do a pill and continue on from there,'' he says.

It was only a couple of months after OxyContin arrived in town that Curt and most of his customers realized they were addicted. At first, they were happy just to take a pill whenever one was around, for fun, but soon they found themselves experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms if they didn't have a pill every day. Everyone's tolerance built up quickly -- one week they were able to get by on a 20 a day, the next week they'd need a 40, and a couple of weeks later, it had to be an 80. ''No one knew what was going on,'' Curt says. ''These are a bunch of pot smokers, drinkers, just mellow people. This drug just took us by storm. A whole community, at least a hundred people I know around here. They're all into the addiction. These are guys I used to smoke pot with and drink beer with in the woods. I grew up with them all, having parties and that. And now there's not one of them -- not one of them -- that don't use pills.''

Purdue Pharma wasn't aware of significant problems with OxyContin abuse until April 2000, when a front-page article in The Bangor Daily News, claiming that OxyContin ''is quickly becoming the recreational drug of choice in Maine,'' landed on the desk of Purdue's senior medical director, Dr. J. David Haddox. In the summer of 2000, the company formed a response team, made up of medical personnel, public relations specialists and two of the company's top executives, which has guided the company's OxyContin campaign ever since.

It's fair to say that in public relations terms, Purdue's reaction to the OxyContin problem has been less than successful. As recently as six months ago, the company had a considerable supply of good will in the media, the government and the affected communities; it is now facing 12 separate potential class-action suits from former patients, as well as one from the attorney general of West Virginia; formerly sympathetic community leaders in Appalachia and Maine have grown increasingly skeptical of the company's approach; and in separate Congressional testimony, Attorney General John Ashcroft called OxyContin a ''very, very dangerous drug,'' and Donnie Marshall, then head of the D.E.A., said in May that unless he received ''more cooperation'' from Purdue, he was ''seriously considering rolling back the quotas that D.E.A. sets . . . to the 1996 level,'' which would have meant a 95 percent cut in production.

Purdue's P.R. problems seem rooted in the company's deep-seated belief in the inherent safety of and public need for its product. It is an article of faith for the company that illegal traffic in its drug is the work of ''bad guys'' and ''professionals,'' in Haddox's words. In fact, Purdue says that its internal data indicate that the levels of OxyContin abuse in the country are no greater than expected. ''We have had increased numbers in the last year or so,'' I was told by Robert Reder, Purdue's vice president of medical affairs and worldwide drug safety, ''but our estimation is that they're commensurate with the distribution of the drug.'' The abuse situation, according to Reder's numbers, is normal. (Government statistics indicate that as of 1999, 221,000 Americans had abused OxyContin.) The real victims, the company says, are their ''legitimate patients,'' who would be denied OxyContin if its distribution were restricted.

In March, Purdue announced a 10-point plan to combat OxyContin abuse. The plan includes tamper-resistant prescription pads for doctors, antidiversion brochures and educational seminars for doctors and pharmacists in affected areas, an initiative to combat smuggling of OxyContin from Mexico and Canada and a donation of $100,000 to a Virginia group for a study of prescription-monitoring programs. To Purdue, the plan is generous and well focused; to people in the communities where abuse is widespread, it seems like a way for the company to avoid the real problem. I spoke several times this spring and summer to Debbie Trent, a professional counselor in Gilbert, W. Va., who runs the local antidrug community group called STOP (Strong Through Our Plan). In our first conversation, she was scrupulously cautious and polite when she spoke about Purdue Pharma, saying, ''I don't want STOP to be seen as fighting OxyContin.'' During STOP's first few months, Haddox addressed her group twice.

When we spoke in April, though, Trent told me that she had come to believe that the company's 10-point plan was addressing the wrong problems -- prescription fraud and international smuggling, for example, when what Gilbert really needed was a way to get immediate treatment for its many addicts. ''I read about the tamper-proof prescription pads and I think, Give me a break!'' she said. ''That seems like such a little thing. It seems so minute in comparison to the scope of the problem. It's almost intentionally missing the point. Rather than prescription pads, I would like to see something done in rehab, something where they're making an effort to help these folks get better.''

Similar sentiments were expressed in Maine in July, when Purdue announced its latest solution to the OxyContin problem: a $100,000 grant to start a ''mini-M.B.A.'' program in high schools. This fall, Purdue will send 20 teachers from some of the most affected counties in Appalachia and Maine to New York for training by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship. When they return to their schools, they will teach students how to formulate a business plan and invest in the stock market. The idea is to ''provide these kids with a sense of hope,'' according to a Purdue spokesperson. A Maine school administrator was quoted in The Boston Globe asking why the company ''wouldn't have come up here and asked us what we want''; if anyone had, she said, she would have asked for money for the treatment of addicts rather than entrepreneurial training.

Again and again, Purdue has apparently been blindsided by criticism. At a news conference in Alabama attended by parents whose teenage children had died from OxyContin overdoses, Gov. Don Siegelman interrupted a Purdue doctor who was going point by point through Purdue's 10-point plan. ''I find this very offensive, and I want you to stop,'' he said as the doctor stood open-mouthed in front of the television cameras. ''We've had enough public relations and enough sugar-coating of this issue and quite frankly, as governor, I am fed up.'' In March, Haddox had what he thought was a cordial and cooperative meeting with Attorney General Darrell V. McGraw of West Virginia to discuss the company's plan to combat drug abuse. Less than three months later, McGraw filed a lawsuit against Purdue, charging the company with ''highly coercive and inappropriate tactics to attempt to get physicians and pharmacists to prescribe OxyContin and to fill prescriptions for OxyContin, often when it was not called for,'' and seeking millions of dollars in compensation for state medical costs.

In the meantime, the lack of co-ordination between Purdue and the government agencies that regulate it has had serious repercussions in affected communities, as local police, small-town mayors and individual doctors and pharmacies have been forced to make up their own policies on the fly. Six states -- Florida, Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Ohio and South Carolina -- have introduced regulations making it harder for Medicaid recipients to receive OxyContin. After the recent spate of pharmacy robberies near Boston, dozens of drug stores in Massachusetts pulled OxyContin from their shelves -- only to be ordered by the state pharmacy board to begin carrying the drug again. In the small town of Pulaski, Va., the police have instituted a program in which patients picking up OxyContin prescriptions from local pharmacies must give their fingerprints, a development that has alarmed civil liberties advocates. Doctors in many states, sometimes fearing reprisals from the D.E.A., have refused to prescribe OxyContin even to patients clearly in need.

Purdue's executives see the company as an unwitting victim of criminal activity -- not unlike Johnson &amp; Johnson in 1982, when seven people were killed by Extra-Strength Tylenol tablets that had been laced with cyanide. The company's critics prefer to compare Purdue to tobacco companies and handgun manufacturers, who are increasingly likely to be found liable for deaths caused by their products. Clearly, the company failed to anticipate the growing chorus of public sentiment against it. And as OxyContin incidents move closer to Washington and New York, pressure may increase on the D.E.A. and the F.D.A. to take regulatory action against Purdue.

When I returned to the Gateway rehabilitation Center outside Pittsburgh earlier this month, I got a clearer sense of the way in which OxyContin is taking hold in urban and suburban America. I also learned about an unexpected secondary effect of OxyContin abuse: in cities like Pittsburgh, the crackdown on OxyContin is resulting in a sharp rise in heroin abuse.

I sat for an afternoon in a glassed-in conference room, looking out on Gateway's parking lot and groomed grounds, and talked with Andy and B., two addicts and former low-level dealers. Before trying OxyContin, they had used their share of recreational drugs, but they didn't consider themselves part of a hard-core drug community. Aside from the track marks on his arms, B., 21, looked like every disaffected college kid in America. He was a professional sloucher, dressed in an orange T-shirt, Army shorts and sneakers, with a mop of brown hair. Andy wore a sparse goatee, a hooded Ecko sweatshirt and a baseball cap with a Japanese character on it. I asked him what it meant, and he said he didn't know.

B. began using OxyContin in 1998, when a friend told him about the pills. He soon started dealing to support his habit, buying pills from a dozen or so people and then selling them from his apartment to friends and friends of friends. His sources were all legitimate pain patients, sick with cancer, carpal tunnel syndrome, lupus or chronic back problems. But, as B. explained, they would often supplement their OxyContin prescriptions with something weaker and cheaper, like Vicodin, then sell the OxyContin and struggle through the month on Vicodin. ''Some of them were old sick ladies who've never done drugs,'' B. said. ''They didn't understand what oxy can do to people. They just knew they were getting $20 for each pill -- $1,800 a month off something they can do without. They just wanted that money.''

Andy laughed. ''Old people are supposed to keep young people off drugs,'' he said.

B. described for me the casual feel of his drug deals. For the first several months that he was selling OxyContin, he said, everything was friendly when he'd go to pick up pills from his suppliers. ''Most of them would say, 'Hi, honey, come on in.' You go into their house and sit down and have something to drink and talk for a while and see how their family's doing, and they see how mine's doing. They were nice people. I don't think they think of themselves as drug dealers.'' Nonetheless, B. said, his suppliers kept most of the profits; he'd generally buy their pills for $20 apiece and then sell them for $25.

About six months ago, B. said, as the police and news media began to sound the alarm about OxyContin abuse, local doctors grew anxious. Many switched their patients to harder-to-abuse fentanyl patches and morphine, and B. lost most of his connections. The supply dried up, prices rose and people started ripping each other off.

A friend told him that shooting heroin was just like shooting OxyContin, only cheaper. He'd never imagined that he might take heroin, but the expense of OxyContin was killing him. ''I was spending a hundred bucks a day on oxy,'' B. said. ''That's why I switched to heroin. You get really high off two bags, which is 30 bucks a day. That's a big savings.''

Andy agreed. It took him only a month and a half to go from using OxyContin for the first time to shooting heroin, he said. ''I've always said that I'd never ever touch heroin. But then oxys came along and that's the same thing, just cleaner. And that got me into shooting dope. If I'd never touched OxyContin, I wouldn't have done heroin.''

In Pittsburgh and its suburbs, Andy and B.'s stories aren't unique. Gateway's doctors report a sharp increase in admissions of young heroin addicts who started out on OxyContin. ''Ninety percent of my friends that were addicted to oxys are now addicted to heroin,'' B. said. ''I know probably 30 or 40 heroin IV drug users now because of OxyContin.''

OxyContin entered the lives of casual drug users as a Trojan horse, disguised as something it is not. It has never become a popular drug among existing heroin or crack addicts, who already have a cheaper and at least as intoxicating mechanism for getting high. OxyContin does the most damage when it enters a community of casual drug users -- Curt's pot smokers and beer drinkers -- who think of pain pills as just another interesting diversion for a Saturday night. In networks like Curt's or Paula's, before OxyContin, no one ever did heroin or crack; those were seen as an entirely different category of drug: something that will take over your life.

When you hold it in your hand, an OxyContin pill doesn't seem any different than a Tylox or a Percocet or any of the mild narcotic preparations that have for years seeped out of the pharmaceutical pipeline and into the lives of casual drug users. What B. and Andy and Paula and Curt failed to realize is that despite appearances, OxyContin actually belongs on the other side of the drug divide; it might look like a casual Saturday-night drug, but it's a take-over-your-life drug. Rehab centers across the country are filling up with young people who discovered that fact too late.

To Art Van Zee, the doctor who has seen his small community in western Virginia ''devastated'' by OxyContin abuse, the answer to the crisis is to take OxyContin off the market. Van Zee is circulating a petition asking the F.D.A. and Purdue to withdraw the pill until a safer formulation can be found. ''The bottom line is, there's much more harm being created by this drug being available than good,'' he says. ''There are very good medicines available that are equally effective. We can certainly meet people's pain needs without OxyContin.''

But for many people, ''drug communities'' like Curt's are not worthy of a whole lot of official sympathy or regulatory concern -- especially not when their interests are considered next to those of patients in pain, who are using OxyContin the way it is meant to be used and whose lives have been improved as a result. For doctors who have seen their patients transformed by OxyContin, there is something mystifying, even infuriating, about the suggestion that it should be withdrawn or even restricted, just because a bunch of kids in Kentucky didn't know what they were snorting.

''There is no question that increasing opioid consumption for legitimate medical purposes is going to lead to some increase in the rates of addiction,'' Portenoy of Beth Israel says. ''But the fact is, the trade-off is worth it. At the moment, the attitude is that if one housewife in Alabama becomes addicted, then the drug must be pulled and the company shut down. But we're talking about millions of people whose lives can be brought back from total disability by the proper use of opioids. Any actions taken by law enforcement or the regulatory community that increase the stigma associated with these drugs, or increase the fear of physicians in prescribing these drugs, is going to exacerbate an already terrible condition and hurt patients.''

The 10th point in Purdue Pharma's 10-point plan to reduce OxyContin abuse is reformulation. The company says that it is spending millions of dollars to create a new version of OxyContin, or perhaps a whole new medication, that would have all the benefits of OxyContin and none of its dangers. Of all the initiatives under way, this is the one that has received the most attention and created the most hope in Appalachia and other affected areas.

In some interviews, Purdue's representatives sound downright enthusiastic about this idea. Earlier this month, they put a price tag -- $50 million -- on the project for the first time. But when pressed, Haddox admits that what Purdue's scientists are looking for is a ''holy grail,'' a drug that will activate the receptors in the brain that control pain relief and leave alone those that control euphoria. And this isn't a new initiative, it turns out, but one that the company has been working on for many years. Scientists and doctors as far back as Hippocrates have tried to find a way to separate the benefits of opiates from their dangers.

There are often suggestions from Purdue that this reformulation may take ''a few years''; it's also entirely possible that it will never happen. Opioids, including OxyContin, may remain the double-edged sword they have always been. And regulators may simply decide to accept a certain amount of unintentional damage in the treatment of pain, and leave local police chiefs and drug counselors -- as well as individual addicts -- to find solutions to the OxyContin problem on their own.

	Doctor or Drug Pusher


Ronald McIver is a prisoner in a medium-security federal compound in Butner, N.C. He is 63 years old, of medium height and overweight, with a white Santa Claus beard, white hair and a calm, direct and intelligent manner. He is serving 30 years for drug trafficking, and so will likely live there the rest of his life. McIver (pronounced mi-KEE-ver) has not been convicted of drug trafficking in the classic sense. He is a doctor who for years treated patients suffering from chronic pain. At the Pain Therapy Center, his small storefront office not far from Main Street in Greenwood, S.C., he cracked backs, gave trigger-point injections and put patients through physical therapy. He administered ultrasound and gravity-inversion therapy and devised exercise regimens. And he wrote prescriptions for high doses of opioid drugs like OxyContin.

McIver was a particularly aggressive pain doctor. Pain can be measured only by how patients say they feel: on a scale from 0 to 10, a report of 0 signifies the absence of pain; 10 is unbearable pain. Many pain doctors will try to reduce a patient's pain to the level of 5. McIver tried for a 2. He prescribed more, and sooner, than most doctors.

Some of his patients sold their pills. Some abused them. One man, Larry Shealy, died with high doses of opioids that McIver had prescribed him in his bloodstream. In April 2005, McIver was convicted in federal court of one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and eight counts of distribution. (He was also acquitted of six counts of distribution.) The jury also found that Shealy was killed by the drugs McIver prescribed. McIver is serving concurrent sentences of 20 years for distribution and 30 years for dispensing drugs that resulted in Shealy's death. His appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court were rejected.

McIver's case is not simply the story of a narcotics conviction. It has enormous relevance to the lives of the one in five adult Americans who, according to a 2005 survey by Stanford University Medical Center, ABC News and USA Today, reported they suffered from chronic pain -- pain lasting for several months or longer. According to a 2003 study in The Journal of the American Medical Association, pain costs American workers more than $61 billion a year in lost productive time -- and that doesn't include medical bills.

Contrary to the old saw, pain kills. A body in pain produces high levels of hormones that cause stress to the heart and lungs. Pain can cause blood pressure to spike, leading to heart attacks and strokes. Pain can also consume so much of the body's energy that the immune system degrades. Severe chronic pain sometimes leads to suicide. There are, of course, many ways to treat pain: some pain sufferers respond well to surgery, physical therapy, ultrasound, acupuncture, trigger-point injections, meditation or over-the-counter painkillers like Advil (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen). But for many people in severe chronic pain, an opioid (an opiumlike compound) like OxyContin, Dilaudid, Vicodin, Percocet, oxycodone, methadone or morphine is the only thing that allows them to get out of bed. Yet most doctors prescribe opioids conservatively, and many patients and their families are just as cautious as their doctors. Men, especially, will simply tough it out, reasoning that pain is better than addiction.

It's a false choice. Virtually everyone who takes opioids will become physically dependent on them, which means that withdrawal symptoms like nausea and sweats can occur if usage ends abruptly. But tapering off gradually allows most people to avoid those symptoms, and physical dependence is not the same thing as addiction. Addiction -- which is defined by cravings, loss of control and a psychological compulsion to take a drug even when it is harmful -- occurs in patients with a predisposition (biological or otherwise) to become addicted. At the very least, these include just below 10 percent of Americans, the number estimated by the United States Department of Health and Human Services to have active substance-abuse problems. Even a predisposition to addiction, however, doesn't mean a patient will become addicted to opioids. Vast numbers do not. Pain patients without prior abuse problems most likely run little risk. ''Someone who has never abused alcohol or other drugs would be extremely unlikely to become addicted to opioid pain medicines, particularly if he or she is older,'' says Russell K. Portenoy, chairman of pain medicine and palliative care at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York and a leading authority on the treatment of pain.

The other popular misconception is that a high dose of opioids is always a dangerous dose. Even many doctors assume it; but they are nonetheless incorrect. It is true that high doses can cause respiratory failure in people who are not already taking the drugs. But that same high dose will not cause respiratory failure in someone whose drug levels have been increased gradually over time, a process called titration. For individuals who are properly titrated and monitored, there is no ceiling on opioid dosage. In this sense, high-dose prescription opioids can be safer than taking high doses of aspirin, Tylenol or Advil, which cause organ damage in high doses, regardless of how those doses are administered. (Every year, an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 Americans die from gastrointestinal bleeding associated with drugs like ibuprofen or aspirin, according to a paper published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology.)

Still, doctors who put patients on long-term high-dose opioids must be very careful. They must monitor the patients often to ensure that the drugs are being used correctly and that side effects like constipation and mental cloudiness are not too severe. Doctors should also not automatically assume that if small doses aren't working, that high doses will -- opioids don't help everyone. And research indicates that in some cases, high doses of opioids can lose their effectiveness and that some patients are better off if they take drug ''holidays'' or alternate between different medicines. Pain doctors also concede that more studies are needed to determine the safety of long-term opioid use.

But with careful treatment, many patients whose opioid levels are increased gradually can function well on high doses for years. ''Dose alone says nothing about proper medical practice,'' Portenoy says. ''Very few patients require doses that exceed even 200 milligrams of OxyContin on a daily basis. Having said this, pain specialists are very familiar with a subpopulation of patients who require higher doses to gain effect. I myself have several patients who take more than 1,000 milligrams of OxyContin or its equivalent every day. One is a high-functioning executive who is pain-free most of the time, and the others have a level of pain control that allows a reasonable quality of life.''

All modern pain-management textbooks advocate ''titration to effect'' -- in other words, in cases where opioids are helping, gradually increasing the dosage until either the pain is acceptably controlled or the side effects begin to outweigh the pain-relief benefits. But the vast majority of doctors don't practice what the textbooks counsel. In part, this is because of the stigma associated with high-dose opioids, the fear that patients will become addicted and the fact that careful monitoring is very time-consuming. And most doctors have received virtually no training in medical school about managing pain: many hold the same misconceptions about addiction and dosage as the general public.

And even pain specialists can be conservative. Sean E. Greenwood died in August at age 50 of a cerebral hemorrhage that his wife, Siobhan Reynolds, attributes to untreated pain. Greenwood was seeing various pain specialists. What makes his undertreatment especially remarkable is that he and his wife founded the Pain Relief Network, an advocacy group that has been the most vocal opponent of prosecutions of doctors and financed part of the legal defense of many pain doctors. ''Here I am -- I know everyone, and even I couldn't get him care that didn't first regard him as a potential criminal,'' Reynolds said.

According to the pharmaceutical research company IMS Health, prescriptions for opioids have risen over the past few years. They are used now more than ever before. Yet study after study has concluded that pain is still radically undertreated. The Stanford University Medical Center survey found that only 50 percent of chronic-pain sufferers who had spoken to a doctor about their pain got sufficient relief. According to the American Pain Society, an advocacy group, fewer than half of cancer patients in pain get adequate pain relief.

Several states are now preparing new opioid-dosing guidelines that may inadvertently worsen undertreatment. This year, the state of Washington advised nonspecialist doctors that daily opioid doses should not exceed the equivalent of 120 milligrams of oral morphine daily -- for oxycodone or OxyContin, that's just 80 milligrams per day -- without the patient's also consulting a pain specialist. Along with the guidelines, officials published a statewide directory of such specialists. It contains 12 names. ''There are just not enough pain specialists,'' says Scott M. Fishman, chief of pain medicine at the University of California at Davis and a past president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine. And the guidelines may keep nonspecialists from prescribing higher doses. ''Many doctors will assume that if the state of Washington suggests this level of care, then it is unacceptable to proceed otherwise,'' Fishman says.

In addition to medical considerations real or imagined, there is another deterrent to opioid use: fear. According to the D.E.A., 71 doctors were arrested last year for crimes related to ''diversion'' -- the leakage of prescription medicine into illegal drug markets. The D.E.A. also opened 735 investigations of doctors, and an investigation alone can be enough to put a doctor out of business, as doctors can lose their licenses and practices and have their homes, offices and cars seized even if no federal criminal charges are ever filed. Both figures -- arrests and investigations -- have risen steadily over the last few years.

Opioid drugs have been used to treat pain for decades, mostly for acute postsurgical pain or the pain of cancer patients. But in January 1996, Purdue Pharma helped increase the use of these drugs by introducing OxyContin -- oxycodone with a time-release mechanism. Oncologists and pain doctors were the principal prescribers of opioids. But Purdue introduced the drug with an aggressive marketing campaign promoting OxyContin to general practitioners and the idea of opioid pain relief to doctors and consumers. The product's time-release mechanism, Purdue claimed, allowed steadier pain relief and deterred abuse.

Many pain sufferers found that OxyContin gave them better relief than they ever had before. But Purdue misrepresented the drug's potential for abuse. Last month, the company and three of its executives pleaded guilty to federal charges that they misled doctors and patients. The company agreed to pay $600 million in fines; and the executives, a total of $34.5 million. The pill's time-release mechanism turned out to be easily circumvented by crushing the pill and snorting or injecting the resulting powder. By the late 1990s, OxyContin abuse was devastating small towns throughout Appalachia and rural New England. Pharmaceuticals, mainly opioids, are still widely abused -- now more so than any illegal drug except marijuana. In 2005, according to the government's National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 6.4 million Americans, many of them teenagers, had abused pharmaceuticals recently. Most got the drug from friends or family -- often, in the case of teenagers, from their parents' medicine cabinets.

At the time the OxyContin epidemic emerged, the D.E.A. had far more experience seizing illegal drugs like cocaine and heroin. According to Mark Caverly, the head of the liaison and policy section for the D.E.A.'s Office of Diversion Control, the OxyContin epidemic, however, required the agency to step up its antidiversion efforts. In 2001 the D.E.A. established the OxyContin Action Plan. The D.E.A. dispatched investigators to the most troubled states and trained local law-enforcement officials.

The basis of the physician-patient relationship is trust. Trust is especially valued by pain patients, who often have long experience of being treated like criminals or hysterics. But when prescribing opioids, a physician's trust is easily abused. Pain doctors dispense drugs with a high street value that are attractive to addicts. All pain doctors encounter scammers; some doctors estimate that as many as 20 percent of their patients are selling their medicine or are addicted to opioids or other drugs. Experts are virtually unanimous in agreeing that even addicts who are suffering pain can be successfully treated with opioids. Indeed, opioids can be lifesaving for addicts -- witness the methadone maintenance therapy given to heroin addicts. But treating addicts requires extra care.

Identifying the scammers is especially tricky because there is no objective test for pain -- it doesn't show up on an X-ray. In one British study, half the respondents who complained of lower-back pain had normal M.R.I.'s. Conversely, a third of those with no pain showed disk degeneration on their M.R.I.'s. The study suggested there could be a profound disconnection between what an M.R.I. sees and what a patient feels.

There are red flags that indicate possible abuse or diversion: patients who drive long distances to see the doctor, or ask for specific drugs by name, or claim to need more and more of them. But people with real pain also occasionally do these things. The doctor's dilemma is how to stop the diverters without condemning other patients to suffer unnecessarily, since a drug diverter and a legitimate patient can look very much alike. The dishonest prescriber and the honest one can also look alike. Society has a parallel dilemma: how to stop drug-dealing doctors without discouraging real ones and worsening America's undertreatment of pain.

In July 2002, an insurance agent was sifting through records in Columbia, S.C., and paused at the file of one Larry Shealy. Shealy was getting OxyContin from a doctor named Ronald McIver -- a lot of it. ''The amounts were incredible; it jumped out in my face,'' the agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told me. ''He was either selling them or taking so much he couldn't live.'' The agent did two things. He recommended to Shealy's employers that they exclude OxyContin coverage from their health insurance plan -- which they did. And he called the D.E.A. Two days later, a D.E.A. agent showed up in the insurance agent's office with an administrative subpoena to collect Shealy's file.

McIver wanted to be a doctor all his life, two of his daughters told me. But he taught and traveled for years before he finally enrolled at Michigan State University to become a D.O., or doctor of osteopathy, a more holistic alternative to a traditional medical education. (Osteopaths can do everything that traditional M.D.'s can do, including prescribe opioids.) He began practicing pain medicine in the late 1980s. He had a practice in Florence, S.C., which ended when he declared bankruptcy in 2000. He moved to Greenwood to start over, establishing his new office in a storefront next to a chiropractor.

McIver was, by the account of his patients, an unusual doctor in the age of the 10-minute managed-care visit. He usually saw about 6 to 12 patients each day. One patient I spoke with -- who never got high-dose opioids -- said that his first visit with McIver lasted four hours, and in subsequent visits he spent an hour or more doing various therapies. Many patients said their visits lasted an hour. Patients taking opioids had to sign a pain contract and bring their pills in at each visit to be counted.

Many doctors take little interest in the administrative side of their practices, but McIver's neglect was epic. To save money, he employed mostly family. His wife, Carolyn, whose only medical training was from her husband, served as his assistant, giving shots and administering therapies. ''His doctor's office did not resemble my family's doctor's office,'' said Sgt. Bobby Grogan, who was the investigator on the case for the Greenwood County Sheriff. While McIver's treatment rooms were normal, his and his wife's offices -- off limits to patients -- were a mess, according to pictures presented at McIver's trial by Adam Roberson, the D.E.A.'s principal investigator. Used syringes, for example, overflowed their storage box. ''His patient records were manila envelopes stuffed with receipts,'' Grogan told me.

When I interviewed him in prison recently, McIver told me that his records were complete but scattered. He said that he and his wife, distracted by a series of family tragedies, had employed a series of temporary receptionists who had botched the filing. He and his wife were trying to piece them together. ''The records were probably half in the office and half at home for me to work on at night,'' he said. ''I kept a box in the back of the car I worked on while Carolyn drove.''

Leslie Smith first came to see McIver in the fall of 2001. Smith was in his mid-40s and lived in Chapin, a small town near Columbia, a 60-mile drive from Greenwood. He filled out a medical-history form and told McIver that his wrists hurt so badly that he was getting only three or four hours' sleep a night. He also said that a previous doctor helped him by prescribing OxyContin, and he mentioned the name of a doctor he said referred him. McIver examined Smith's wrists. Smith walked out with an opioid prescription and an appointment to come back the next week.

Smith's wrists did not hurt him, as he testified at McIver's trial. He was addicted to OxyContin and Dilaudid. He complained of wrist pain because it was plausible: he had injured one wrist previously, requiring an operation that left scars, and he had arthritis in the other. Until June 2002, Smith kept getting prescriptions. What he didn't inject himself he sold to pay for more drugs, he testified.

Smith saw McIver every few weeks. He testified that he had track marks on his arm at the time but always wore long sleeves to cover them. He said McIver never saw them. McIver put him on an electric nerve stimulator every visit for 15 or 30 minutes on each hand and did osteopathic manipulations. He prescribed exercises. Smith bought a nerve-stimulator machine to use at home and told McIver it was helping. At McIver's request he filled out a pain chart and reported that his pain rated a 5 or 6 upon awakening, reached 7 during the day and occasionally hit 9. ''I answered all the questions exactly like I thought he'd want to hear them answered,'' Smith testified. At one point McIver found a syringe in Smith's pocket. Smith told McIver that he was going fishing later that day and that he used the syringe as part of his fishing equipment. That apparently satisfied McIver, who testified that his grandfather kept syringes in his tackle box to pump air into his bait.

Smith filled some of his prescriptions at the Hawthorne Pharmacy in West Columbia. There, Addison Livingston, the pharmacist, got suspicious. He noticed that Smith sometimes came in with other patients of McIver's, despite the fact that McIver worked nearly two hours' drive away. The patients obviously knew each other and would pick up large opioid prescriptions, paying cash and asking for brand-name drugs. Livingston called McIver, who confirmed he had written the prescriptions. At one point, McIver told Livingston that he, too, was suspicious, and that he had sent a letter about Smith to the state's Bureau of Drug Control.

In February 2002, McIver wrote to Larry McElrath, a B.D.C. inspector, who read the letter at the trial. ''Dear Larry,'' it read, ''There are several people out of the Columbia/Chapin area who have aroused my curiosity about their use and possible misuse of medications. Some are referred by [another doctor] and seem legitimate. . . . They all pay cash despite some of them having insurance with prescription cards. . . . When they are in the office, they sometimes make a show of not knowing each other. . . . The situation is made complicated by the fact that each has some real pathology with objective findings that would justify the use of opiates if their pains are as bad as they say. I have given them the benefit of the doubt, but I'm becoming less inclined to do so. I would appreciate it if you could make some discrete inquiries and let me know whether my concerns are justified. . . . I certainly don't want to refuse help to someone who needs it. On the other hand, I want even less to be implicated in diversion or other improprieties.'' He listed their names and Social Security numbers.

McElrath did nothing with the letter. ''It's incumbent upon the physician to have a trust with his patients,'' McElrath testified at the trial. ''Here there was nothing that I could assume or conclude that any crimes had been committed.''

Smith was the most damning of the several patients who testified against McIver. (Smith and the other patients mentioned here did not agree to be interviewed for this article, as they are suing McIver for alleged overprescription of addictive drugs. Such suits often prosper after successful criminal convictions, as civil suits are easier to win.) Smith had a confederate in Seth Boyer, who lived in Chapin and followed a similar pattern in his dealings with McIver: he exaggerated pains in his foot, never provided records from a previous doctor and had needle tracks that he later testified McIver never saw. At one point, Boyer told McIver that he had spilled a bottle of liquid OxyFast, another opioid. (In reality, Boyer had injected it.) McIver wrote him a prescription for a replacement -- apparently a violation of his standard pain-medication contract, which had a ''no early refills'' stipulation.

But McIver ended up discharging Boyer in June 2002, when Boyer altered a prescription so he could fill it three days early. He wrote McIver three pleading letters of protest, to no avail. ''I was looking for an excuse to discharge them, and with Seth I found it,'' McIver told me. ''I needed more than suspicion. With Les, he never actually did anything that allowed me to say, 'O.K., here's that concrete piece of evidence.' ''

McIver may have felt he needed more proof, but medically he probably had enough. Pain specialists told me that doctors can stop prescribing a drug whenever the risks outweigh the benefits, which includes the risk of abuse.

Another drug-dealing patient of McIver's was Kyle Barnes. She testified that she suffered from fibromyalgia, a chronic-pain syndrome, but exaggerated her pain to get higher levels of OxyContin and Roxicodone. She was addicted to those drugs before she began seeing McIver in July 2001. She also brought no medical records and drove three hours to each appointment. She got prescriptions on her second visit, during which McIver also did osteopathic manipulations and massage.

Barnes was in real pain. McIver did several different therapies at each visit. He set up an appointment for her at a sleep clinic, sent her for X-rays and put a cast on her wrist. He knew she had trouble paying for her medicines, and he contacted Purdue Pharma to see if she qualified for reduced-price drugs. She kept claiming the drugs were not helping enough and was soon taking 16 times the dose of OxyContin she took when she first saw him. One tip-off in her case should have been that she paid thousands of dollars a month in cash for her prescriptions, even though she was on Medicaid. She told McIver that her father and boyfriend were helping her buy them, which she later testified was partly true. But most of her income came from selling some of the drugs he prescribed, she testified. In December 2003, McIver told her that he would stop treating her unless she took a drug screen. She did nothing. Three weeks later he told her again. She never returned.

Another patient whose story was particularly troubling was Barbee Brown. Brown was not a drug seeker but a genuine pain patient seeking relief from Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. McIver gave her very high doses of OxyContin right away, before she produced any records from other doctors. This was especially disturbing, because she had been addicted to crack cocaine for three months in the year before she came to him.

Brown saw McIver at least twice a week for six weeks. He did a thorough physical exam and took a complete history. He used many different kinds of therapies. But he also started her -- someone who had never taken opioids -- on 40-milligram pills of OxyContin and allowed her to control her own dosing schedule. ''As long as you are not having side effects, do not be afraid to take the doses you need to get out of pain,'' he wrote to her. It was the same advice he gave many patients. ''The number of milligrams does not matter. What matters is the number on the 0-to-10 scale.''

The medicine helped. Brown testified that she ranked her pain at 9 or 10 when she first got to McIver. After seeing him, it dropped to a 4. Her pain diary, which appears to be sincere, had various passages giving thanks that she met McIver. Brown did not become addicted. But allowing an opioid-naïve recovering crack addict to start on high-dose pills and control her own dosage, and telling her that her dosage didn't matter, seems reckless.

McIver's 30-year sentence was the result of the death of Larry Shealy, a 56-year-old man who suffered intense back and knee pain, in addition to many other health problems. He first came to see McIver in February 2002, with full referrals and records. He was on OxyContin before seeing McIver but complained that his pain was still terrible, so McIver doubled his dose. This allowed Shealy to go back to work in an auto body shop.

Shealy was not a careful patient. A month after he started with McIver, he took 15 OxyContin tablets in one day instead of the 6 he was prescribed. He was not harmed, but McIver testified that he asked Shealy to bring his family in so he could explain the dosing to them. At one point, McIver tried to taper down the OxyContin and replace it with methadone, but Shealy complained that the methadone made him drowsy. Shealy's son, David, an auto mechanic, testified that the OxyContin pain relief also came at a price. He said he felt his father was overmedicated -- often sleepy. Once, his father backed his truck into a tree.

Shealy died in his sleep early on the morning of May 29, 2003. He had OxyContin pills in his stomach, and his bloodstream contained alprazolam -- Xanax -- as well. The pathologist at McIver's trial testified that the levels of drugs were consistent with the prescriptions McIver had been writing -- the high levels that so alarmed the insurance agent. Shealy was taking five 80-milligram tablets of OxyContin every 12 hours, plus up to six 30-milligram tablets of Roxicodone every 4 hours for breakthrough pain, plus as much as 2 milligrams of alprazolam every 8 hours. The prosecution's toxicologist, Demi Garvin, concluded that the OxyContin and Roxicodone caused Shealy's death by respiratory depression. The pathologist testified that she looked up this dosage and found it to be a fatal level.

But there is reason for doubt. According to Shealy's prescriptions, he had been taking the same dosage for at least two months, and possibly much longer. Pain specialists say that respiratory depression is extremely unlikely when dosage is consistent. In her testimony, Garvin agreed that what would be a toxic level in an opioid-naïve patient would be safe for someone titrated up properly. But she said she could not conclude he had been properly titrated, in part because she had not seen his medical records. Garvin declined to talk about the Shealy case with me because she is a witness for the Shealy family in their planned civil suit against McIver. But in a deposition for that lawsuit, she appeared to back away from blaming the OxyContin. She described her view as: ''Hey, there's a red flag here. This can certainly be your cause of death, but you need to go further in exploring whether or not it is.''

There was something else that might have caused Shealy's death: he suffered from advanced congestive heart failure. The pathologist testified that he had 90 percent blockage in one coronary artery and 50 percent in another, and a greatly enlarged heart and other organs. He had a scar on the back wall of his heart that indicated he at one time suffered a heart attack. Opioids do not worsen heart disease and would likely have helped, because pain causes stress to the heart.

The testimonies of the patients Smith, Boyer and Barnes were the parts of the trial that most directly addressed the question of whether McIver intentionally wrote prescriptions for a nonmedical purpose. This is the relevant legal test for the statute under which he was prosecuted. Several Supreme Court and district court cases have made it clear that under the Controlled Substances Act, a doctor is guilty of a crime if he intentionally acts as a drug pusher.

The judge in the McIver case, Henry F. Floyd, told the jurors that bad prescribing is the standard for malpractice, a civil matter. ''That is not what we are talking about,'' he said. ''We're not talking about this physician acting better or worse than other physicians.'' If McIver was a bad doctor -- but still a doctor, with intent to treat patients -- he was innocent. ''If you find that a defendant acted in good faith in dispensing the drugs charged in this indictment, then you must find that defendant not guilty,'' Floyd said. But Floyd also told the jury to take bad doctoring into account in deciding McIver's intent.

This instruction -- that bad doctoring does not prove intent but could be considered when weighing his intent -- is subtle and potentially extremely confusing. It apparently confused the jurors. I spoke to two jurors, who told me their own views and characterized the jury discussion. The overwhelming factor, they said, was that McIver prescribed too much -- the very red flag that alerted the insurance agent and set the case in motion.

The jurors I spoke with said that by far the most important testimony came from Steven Storick, a pain-management doctor in Columbia and the government's expert witness. Reviewing the records of patient after patient, Storick consistently testified that there were too many drugs. ''This amount of medication is just extremely high in a situation like this,'' he said of one patient. This is ''excessive,'' he said of another. ''That's just an extremely high dose of drug,'' he said of a third. Storick, who declined to be interviewed for this article, testified that if he had a patient who exhibited no objective evidence of pain, he would not prescribe opioids. He would not have titrated patients as rapidly as McIver did or given them discretion. He disagreed with McIver's position that a doctor should try to bring a patient's chronic pain down to a level of 2. He would stop titrating when a patient reached 5 out of 10.

The jurors took Storick's caution to heart, in part, they told me, because it resonated with their own experience with opioids and fears of addiction. I asked Jo Handy, a tall, elegant woman who is now 39 and a real estate agent outside Greenville, why McIver was convicted. ''It was the excessive prescriptions,'' she said in an interview in her office. ''Excessive, and the number of them. I've been on some pain medication. But along with some other jurors we were, like, 'No -- it's too much.' ''

Handy said she knew McIver's treatment was excessive because Storick said so, and because of her own experience. ''Thirty counts is normal,'' she said. ''He was giving 60 or 90. A few of us had been on prescribed medicine. I had female issues. You as a person know not to take so much of that medication. If you were, you had a motive. Me, I still have a whole bottle left.''

Christopher Poore, another juror, agreed that what swayed the jury was the volume of drugs prescribed. ''The jury kept going back to the expert testimony of the prosecution's expert,'' he told me when I met him in Anderson, a town 40 minutes from Greenwood. ''It was beyond. It was too much.'' What should McIver have done, I asked, if he wanted to avoid jail? ''He should have followed the convention more of what people are doing with pain medicine -- not giving so much,'' Poore said.

Poore, who is 40 and runs his family's heating and cooling business, described himself as the juror most skeptical of the prosecution's case. ''There was another guy on the jury who said his sister-in-law had been taking pain pills and she had gotten addicted,'' Poore said. ''He said I was taking up for McIver. I said, No, I'm taking up for you and me and anyone else who's on trial. I wanted to see rules, that this guy broke the rule. I never saw a rule he broke.''

In the end Poore voted to convict. As is always the case, the jurors were dismissed before McIver was sentenced. Poore told me he supposed McIver was in prison. When I said McIver was serving 30 years, he looked shocked.

Interviews with jurors and the judge's sentencing decision indicated that photos of the messy conditions in McIver's and Carolyn's private offices also contributed to the impression that he was not a real doctor. Surprisingly, McIver's contacts with law enforcement -- the letter about Smith and the others was one of several -- helped the prosecution's case. ''He called an officer about a patient,'' John P. Flannery II, McIver's appellate lawyer, explained to me. ''There is no response. He gets zero. He took their silence as a sign everything was O.K. They take that as knowledge of drug dealing.'' It mattered: the Fourth Circuit's opinion rejecting McIver's appeal said, ''That Appellant knew or suspected his patients of drug abuse is reflected by the fact that he wrote to state authorities to express concern that his patients might be selling their medication.''

I asked Grogan, the local diversion investigator on the case, why he didn't follow up on McIver's suspicions. ''I'm a cop, not a doctor,'' Grogan said. ''I can't say to prescribe medication or not. How do I know he's not trying to fish me for information?''

''He doesn't have to call us to cut someone off,'' Mike Frederick, the chief deputy at the sheriff's office, told me. ''This is no different than when regular illegal drug dealers will very often call us about other drug dealers. He did it most likely because he thought that person was a risk.''

I had assumed that McIver's use of many different types of therapies would help his case, by showing he was not running a classic pill mill. But it may have hurt. During the appeal, the prosecutor William Lucius argued that the other treatments represented the profits of drug diversion. He addicted patients with high doses of opioids, Lucius contended, ''so they would continue to come back to him'' and ''he could charge them for the treatments he gave.''

How typical is McIver's case? On the D.E.A.'s Web site the agency lists some of the doctors who have been prosecuted, and their crimes. There are some strikingly obvious and egregious cases of shady dealings: a doctor who wrote prescriptions in a gas station for a person who wasn't present; one who sold blank prescription forms; one who dispensed drugs to people who then shared them with him.

But not every doctor's intent to deal drugs is as clear. McIver was a crusader for high-dose opioids, credulous with patients and sloppy with documentation -- a combination unwise in the extreme. But some of his patients said he was the only doctor who ever brought them relief. Prosecutors never brought any evidence that he intended to write prescriptions to be abused or sold. They never accused him of profiting from his patients' diversion except in collecting office fees. His patients who diverted or abused their opioids all testified they got their prescriptions by consistently lying to him. Nor is it convincing that his prescriptions killed Larry Shealy.

No one has analyzed the various prosecutions of pain doctors, so it is hard to determine how many of them look like McIver's. The D.E.A.'s list is incomplete. There have been many cases like McIver's, and most of these cases are not listed on the D.E.A.'s Web site. (One possible reason for this omission is that some of these cases are still being appealed.) And many cases that do appear on the list detail only vague crimes: convictions for prescribing ''beyond the bounds of acceptable medical practice'' or ''dispensing controlled substances . . . with no legitimate medical purpose'' -- which is how the agency will most likely describe the McIver case if it ever includes the case on the list.

The D.E.A. claims that it is not criminalizing bad medical decisions. For a prosecutable case, Caverly, the D.E.A. officer, told me: ''I need there to be no connection of the drug with a legitimate medical condition. I need the doctor to have prescribed the drug in exchange for an illegal drug, or sex, or just sold the prescription or wrote prescriptions for patients they have never seen, or made up a name.''

I read this statement to Jennifer Bolen, a former federal prosecutor in drug-diversion cases who trained other prosecutors and now advises doctors on the law. ''That's a good goal,'' she said. ''I don't think they have yet reached that goal.'' McIver's case had no such broken connection, and in many cases the government has not produced testimony of intent to push drugs, providing evidence only of negligence or recklessness. In 2002, Bolen was one of the authors of a Justice Department document intended as part of a basic guide to prosecuting drug-diversion cases. The document, in the form of a reference card, dispenses with any need for a broken connection. It suggests that prosecutors need not prove a doctor had bad motives, that to be within the law a doctor had to prescribe ''in strict compliance with generally accepted medical guidelines'' and that doing an abbreviated medical history or physical examination is ''probative'' of lack of a legitimate medical purpose. The reference card was on the Justice Department's Web site but was pulled, according to the Pain Relief Network, which provided the card to me. Bolen told me: ''I have no problem saying that if the card was all there was, it was not acceptable. But it isn't all there was.'' She described the card as one piece of a more thorough training, but added that many prosecutors followed its theories.

Prosecutors are in essence pressing jurors to decide whether an extra 40 milligrams every four hours or a failure to X-ray is enough to send a doctor to prison for the rest of his life. One doctor, Frank Fisher, was arrested on charges that included the death of a patient taking opioids -- who died as a passenger in a car accident. A Florida doctor, James Graves, is serving 63 years for charges including manslaughter after four patients overdosed on OxyContin he prescribed -- all either crushed and injected their OxyContin or mixed it with alcohol or other drugs. ''A lot of doctors are looking for safe harbor,'' Caverly said. ''They want to know as long as they do A, B, C, D or E, they're O.K.''

The D.E.A. once thought that this was not an unreasonable desire. A few years ago, it worked with pain doctors to develop a set of frequently asked questions that set out what doctors needed to do to stay within the law. The FAQ recommended, for example, that doctors should do urine tests and discuss a patient's treatment with family and friends. In October 2004, the FAQ were erased from the agency's Web site. One reason was that one of their authors, who is a doctor, was about to use the list to testify on behalf of William Hurwitz, a pain doctor in McLean, Va. (Hurwitz was convicted on 50 counts of drug trafficking in 2004. His conviction was overturned, and he was recently retried and convicted on 16 lesser counts. He is awaiting sentencing.)

Caverly acknowledged the Hurwitz trial was one reason the FAQ were pulled, but said there were other reasons. He said such a checkoff list could tie the D.E.A.'s hands. ''Some doctor's going to pull that list of dos or don'ts out and say: 'See, I'm O.K. I did these 10.' But there's a new wrinkle there -- an 11th one the doctor didn't do,'' he said. Most important, he went on to say, the FAQ had stepped over the line to insert the D.E.A. into issues of medical practice. ''We have to stay in our lane,'' he said. ''Those definitions are the professional community's -- not the D.E.A.'s.''

In a perfect world, such reasoning would make sense. But the agency is defining issues of medical practice in dramatic fashion -- by jailing doctors who step over the line. It would not seem to be bothering, however, to draw the line first.

The dilemma of preventing diversion without discouraging pain care is part of a larger problem: pain is discussed amid a swirl of ignorance and myth. Howard Heit, a pain and addiction specialist in Fairfax, Va., told me: ''If we take the fact that 10 percent of the population has the disease of addiction, and if we say that pain is the most common presentation to a doctor's office, please tell me why the interface of pain and addiction is not part of the core curriculum of health care training in the United States?'' Will Rowe, the executive director of the American Pain Foundation, notes that ''pain education is still barely on the radar in most medical schools.''

The public also needs education. Misconception reigns: that addiction is inevitable, that pain is harmless, that suffering has redemptive power, that pain medicine is for sissies, that sufferers are just faking. Many law-enforcement officers are as in the dark as the general public. Very few cities and only one state police force have officers who specialize in prescription-drug cases. Charles Cichon, executive director of the National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators (Naddi), says that Naddi offers just about the only training on prescription drugs and reaches only a small percentage of those who end up investigating diversion. I asked if, absent Naddi training, officers would understand such basics as the whether there is a ceiling dose for opioids. ''Probably not,'' he said.

There is another factor that might encourage overzealous prosecution: Local police can use these cases to finance further investigations. A doctor's possessions can be seized as drug profits, and as much as 80 percent can go back to the local police.

There are ways to prevent diversion without imprisoning doctors who have shown no illegal intent. They are increasingly used -- but state authorities and doctors need to push even harder. The majority of states, South Carolina among them, do not yet have prescription monitoring -- a central registry of prescriptions, which could help catch people getting opioids from several different doctors and pharmacies. Doctors should use more urine and blood tests, including screens that can tell quantities of drug present.

Last year, state medical boards took 473 actions against doctors for misdeeds involving prescribing controlled substances. In many cases, their licenses were pulled. Physicians can also lose their D.E.A. registration, and with it the right to prescribe controlled substances. A few dozen do every year, although there is considerable overlap with medical-board actions. Washington is the first state to recommend that only pain specialists handle high-dose opioids; other states are likely to follow.

But such guidelines are futile while there is one pain specialist for, at the very least, every several thousand chronic-pain sufferers nationwide. And even though pain is an exciting new specialty, doctors are not flocking to it. The Federation of State Medical Boards calls ''fear among physicians that they will be investigated, or even arrested, for prescribing controlled substances for pain'' one of the two most important barriers to pain treatment, alongside lack of understanding. Various surveys of physicians have shown that this fear is widespread. ''The bottom line is, doctors say they don't need this,'' said Heit. ''They're in a health care system that wants them to see a patient every 10 to 15 minutes. They don't have time to take a complete history about whether the patient has been addicted. The fear is very real and palpable that if they prescribe Schedule II opioids they will come under the scrutiny of the D.E.A., and they don't need this aggravation.''

Proper pain management will always take time, but the D.E.A. can at least ensure that honest doctors need not fear prison. It should use the standard it claims to follow: for a criminal prosecution to occur, a doctor must have broken the link between the opioid and the medical condition. If the evidence is of recklessness alone, then it should be a case for a state medical board, the D.E.A.'s registration examiners or a civil malpractice jury.

Undoubtedly, such a limit will allow a small group of pill-mill doctors to escape prison. But America lives with freeing suspects whose possible crimes are discovered through warrantless searches or torture -- and unlike other suspects, doctors who lose their licenses are as incapacitated as those behind bars. For cases without the broken connection, prosecution is too blunt an instrument. It runs too high a risk of condemning innocent physicians to prison and discourages the practice of a medical specialty desperately needed by millions of Americans.

Pain patients are the collateral victims here. It is worth remembering that the vast majority of McIver's patients were not people who abused or sold their medicines. One of those who didn't was a man named Ben, a tall, heavy man in his 50s who lives about 45 minutes from Greenwood. (He asked that his last name not be used because of the stigma still attached to taking opioid drugs.) Ben was once a mail carrier and a farmer and cattle rancher. But years of pushing 800-pound bales of hay wore out his back. In 2001 he had an operation to fuse the bottom three vertebrae. The few Vicodin his neurosurgeon prescribed did not control his pain. ''I never had enough to get me through the night,'' he said. ''He wasn't going to go any further than Vicodin -- and he was doing me a favor by doing that, because his other partners wouldn't have done as much as he did.'' His neurosurgeon recommended he find a pain doctor. He started seeing McIver. The first examination, Ben said over coffee in a local Waffle House, was ''extremely thorough -- he had me crying. I hardly ever got out of there in less than two hours -- he would be on top of me popping my back.''

And he got opioids. With his typical imprudence, McIver told Ben: ''You don't worry about it, take whatever you need to be pain-free, if it takes 2 pills or 10 pills. If you're taking too much and slurring your words, you know to back off. Use some common sense.'' At McIver's request, Ben kept a diary of what he took and how much. He reached a top dosage of five 80-milligram pills of OxyContin four times a day -- more opioids than Shealy was taking at the time of his death. ''I never felt high,'' he said. ''They helped my pain. I could get out and work, use the bulldozer. I was working a 250-head cattle herd. I was doing everything relatively pain-free because of the drugs. They gave me my life back.''

When McIver was closed down, Ben was lucky enough to have a family physician he knew well who took over his case. But the new doctor took a very different approach. Ben now gets three 80-milligram pills of OxyContin a day, plus some breakthrough Roxicodone and 800 milligrams of Advil every four to six hours. ''That's it and I'm very, very lucky to have it,'' he said. ''My doctor is afraid they will say it's over the limit. I now get about three hours' sleep a night. I can stand for 30 minutes, maybe.'' He can no longer handle ranching and has sold his cattle. He considers himself retired.

With Ben's permission I talked to his current doctor, who said Ben was a good patient but had been taking way too much. ''I thought Ben made an error,'' he said. ''He had been taking five or six times the recommended dosage. There are well-recognized levels, and you don't step across the line. You may have to live with some pain.''

Opioids have immense power -- both to harm and to heal. They can be life-destroying, but high doses allowed Ben to work, to be with his family, to be who he is. In its prosecutions of pain doctors, the government fails to recognize the duality of these drugs. Ben's wife told me: ''When Ben first went to Dr. McIver and filled out the form on what he used to be able to do and what he could do now, he cried. McIver said to him, 'I'm going to get you back to doing what you used to do.' And he did.''

Correction:  June 19, 2007, Tuesday  An article in The Magazine on Sunday about Dr. Ronald McIver, who is imprisoned for drug trafficking, gave an erroneous account of the trial testimony of one of his patients, Leslie Smith. And a correction in this space on Sunday again referred incorrectly to that testimony. The only point Mr. Smith made in his testimony was that he acknowledged injecting drugs prescribed by Dr. McIver. Mr. Smith never raised the issue of whether he himself sold any drugs that were left over to buy other drugs. And he never referred to Dr. McIver in the context of the leftover drugs -- either that Dr. McIver sold them or did not sell them.

	A Marvel Of Science, Hawking Turns 60


There is no crying in physics, where even the best of friends can call each other's work rubbish, and the most beloved theories are coolly thrown out when experiments contradict them.

But there was emotion tonight in the high-ceilinged hall of Gonville and Caius College here when a butler opened a door and a Marilyn Monroe impersonator slithered in, wearing a pink dress and singing ''I Want to Be Loved by You'' in a whispery voice to Dr. Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge University cosmologist and best-selling author. Dr. Hawking was lolling in a wheelchair, his face split by a huge grin, while some 200 hard-core physicists, their families and friends roared and cheered with laughter, and then joined in singing ''Happy Birthday.''

''Marilyn and I go way back,'' Dr. Hawking said in the android voice of his computerized voice synthesizer, alluding to a scene on the television show ''Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' in which a space warp causes Monroe to appear on his knee.

In his nearly 40 years as a working physicist, Dr. Hawking has led his colleagues in the exploration of black holes -- the gravitational traps that swallow everything, even light -- as well as theories about the origin of the universe, but one of his more astonishing achievements may simply be that he has survived.

Today, 39 years after he was given a death sentence, a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, Dr. Hawking turned 60, a landmark age for a scientist, and one that outstrips by decades the life expectancy for most people with the condition. Accordingly, his colleagues and students, an all-star cast of physicists, have gathered here for four days of workshops and parties. The week will be capped by a day of public lectures, including one by Dr. Hawking himself.

The 60th birthday is an event ''which most of us would, 35 years ago, have laid astronomical odds against witnessing at all, let alone with sustained achievements to celebrate,'' said Dr. Martin Rees, a cosmologist at Cambridge University and Britain's Astronomer Royal, who has known Dr. Hawking since the early 1960's.

In a memoir on his Web site, Dr. Hawking recalls dreaming after his diagnosis that he was going to be executed. But after watching a young boy in a nearby hospital bed die of leukemia, he decided that he himself was not so bad off, yet. He went on to marry and have three children while his career took off and black holes became all the rage.

His most important work came in 1974, physicists say, when he discovered that black holes are not really black but could radiate their mass-energy away and explode. That notion is now at the center of efforts to unite Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the gravity that shapes the cosmos, with the quantum chaos that lives inside it.

For years, the whir of Dr. Hawking's wheelchair, creeping down an aisle of a darkened auditorium, has invested even the dreariest astrophysical gatherings with a gladiatorial drama. His latest book, ''The Universe in a Nutshell,'' like a predecessor, ''A Brief History of Time,'' has climbed the best-seller lists.

Not everyone has been star struck. In 1999, his former wife, Jane Hawking, published a tell-all memoir, ''Music to Move the Stars,'' which described the disintegration of their relationship under the pressures of fame and disability. Dr. Hawking left her in 1990 and later married his nurse, Elaine Mason.

Dr. Hawking's colleagues explain his ability to frustrate grim predictions by pointing to his iron constitution and iron will.

''He is a person of such will, such intellectual strength,'' said Dr. Andrei Linde, a Stanford physicist who met Dr. Hawking in Moscow in the late 1970's. ''It all meshes together.''

That determination transcends science, said Dr. Linde, who recalled Dr. Hawking speeding dangerously down Dr. Linde's steep driveway during a visit to California once.

Dr. Hawking himself almost didn't make his own party. On the Friday after Christmas, according to his friends, he lost control of his new Quantum Jazzy wheelchair and crashed into a wall. The wheelchair toppled and the fragile physicist fell, banging his head and breaking a femur. He was taken to the hospital, where a metal plate was installed, Dr. Rees said.

Apprised of this event, Dr. Linde said: ''He's consistent. Exactly what I told you.''

Sunday night, at the symposium's opening reception, the guest of honor was there, sporting a bruise. Since a tracheotomy in 1985, Dr. Hawking has spoken only via his computer.

Dr. Hawking turned to the front of the crowd and clicked a control button. ''I'm so pleased to see you all,'' he said. ''It is wonderful that nearly everybody who was invited was able to come. It shows there are no boundaries in theoretical physics or in friendship.''

	Peering Through the Gates of Time


It's all come down to this.

In one corner is Dr. John Archibald Wheeler, 90, professor emeritus of physics at Princeton and the University of Texas, armed with a battery of hearing aids, fistfuls of colored chalk, unfailing courtesy, a poet's flair for metaphor, an indomitable sense of duty and the company of a ghost army of great thinkers.

In the other is a ''great smoky dragon,'' which is how Dr. Wheeler refers sometimes to one of the supreme mysteries of nature. That is the ability, according to the quantum mechanic laws that govern subatomic affairs, of a particle like an electron to exist in a murky state of possibility -- to be anywhere, everywhere or nowhere at all -- until clicked into substantiality by a laboratory detector or an eyeball.

Dr. Wheeler suspects that this quantum uncertainty, as it is more commonly known, is the key to understanding why anything exists at all, how something, the universe with its laws, can come from nothing. Or as he likes to put it in the phrase that he has adopted as his mantra: ''How come the quantum? How come existence?''

Standing by the window in his third-floor office in Princeton's Jadwin Hall recently, Dr. Wheeler pointed out at the budding trees and the green domes of the astronomy building in the distance. ''We're all hypnotized into thinking there's something out there,'' he said.

Twice a week he takes a bus from his retirement home in nearby Hightstown to sit here under portraits of Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr, the twin poles of his scientific life, and confront the dragonlike ephemerality of the world, dictating his thoughts to his secretary, Emily Bennett.

''The time left for me on earth is limited,'' he wrote recently. ''And the creation question is so formidable that I can hardly hope to answer it in the time left to me. But each Tuesday and Thursday I will put down the best response that I can, imagining that I am under torture.''

He is under no illusions about who will win the confrontation. A heart attack last year has taken its toll, and he acknowledges that his thoughts are fragmentary, ideas for ideas, as he likes to put it, and not for his present-day colleagues but for the generations of colleagues down the line.

It's what he has been doing his whole life. Dr. Wheeler helped explain nuclear fission with Bohr, argued quantum theory with Einstein, helped build the atomic and hydrogen bombs and pioneered the study of what he later dubbed black holes. Along the way, he indulged his taste for fireworks and mischief and became the hippest poet physicist of his generation, using metaphor as effectively as calculus to capture the imaginations of his students and colleagues and to send them, minds blazing, to the barricades to confront nature.

The phrases Dr. Wheeler has coined constitute a kind of vapor trail marking the path of the aspirations of physics in the last few decades: black hole, quantum foam, law without law, to name a few.

''A major piece of him is that he is a visionary,'' said Dr. Kip Thorne, a  physics professor at California Institute of Technology who was Dr. Wheeler's graduate student at Princeton. ''He tries to see farther over the horizon than most people by way of his physical intuition.''

''He brought the fun back into physics,'' said Dr. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania who has recently collaborated with Dr. Wheeler, ticking off the reasons scientists love him. Physicists, he said, are usually reluctant to talk about Really Big Questions, like the why of existence, for fear of being branded flaky.

''He taught us not to be afraid,'' Dr. Tegmark said.

It is a season of celebration for Dr. Wheeler and of reaping the harvest from generations of seeds of inspiration. The Battelle Memorial Institution of Columbus, Ohio, has donated $3 million to endow a physics chair in Dr. Wheeler's name at Princeton, which celebrated his birthday with one-day symposium last July, and plans a larger event.

This weekend the Really Big Questions that Dr. Wheeler loves will be on the table when prominent scientists gather at a conference center here in his honor for a symposium modestly titled ''Science and Ultimate Reality'' sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation and the Peter Gruber Foundation Cosmology Prize.

The Philosopher King  Bohr Conversations Leave Indelible Mark

Dr. Wheeler once compared himself to Daniel Boone, who, the story goes, felt compelled to move on to new territory every time someone moved within a mile of him. It was in nuclear physics, the science of the buzzing dense cores of atoms, that he first made his mark. Born July 9, 1911, in Jacksonville, Fla., the oldest child in a family of librarians, he earned his Ph.D. in physics from Johns Hopkins at age 21.

A year later, after becoming engaged to an old acquaintance, Janette Hegner, after only three dates -- they have been married 67 years and have three children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren -- Dr. Wheeler took a boat to Copenhagen. There, Bohr was presiding over a small research institute and serving as the philosopher king of a revolution that had shaken physics and common sense to the marrow in the previous decade.

The cornerstone of that revolution was the uncertainty principle, propounded by Werner Heisenberg in 1927, which seemed to put fundamental limits on what could be known about nature, declaring, for example, that it was impossible, even in theory, to know both the velocity and position of a subatomic particle. Knowing one destroyed the ability to measure the other.

As a result, until observed, subatomic particles and events existed in a sort of cloud of possibility, a smoky dragon. In some sense no particle or other phenomenon was real, Bohr said, until it was an observed phenomenon.

The year spent in Copenhagen watching Bohr wrestle with the paradoxes of the quantum world was the beginning of a lifelong relationship that left an indelible mark.

''You can talk about people like Buddha, Jesus, Moses, Confucius, but the thing that convinced me that such people existed were the conversations with Bohr,'' Dr. Wheeler later said.

In January 1939 when Bohr arrived for a visit in the United States, Dr. Wheeler, a young Princeton professor, met the boat.

Within a few weeks the two had sketched out a theory of how nuclear fission, recently discovered in Germany, worked. In their model the nucleus is like a liquid drop that starts vibrating when a neutron hits it, elongating into a peanut shape that then snaps in two, shooting out energy and particles.

Dr. Wheeler was later swept up in the Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb. But he still blames himself for a two-year delay between the time in 1939 that Einstein wrote a letter urging President Franklin D. Roosevelt to start a bomb project and when it got going. Had the war ended two years earlier, he says, millions of lives might have been saved, including that of a younger brother, Joe, who died fighting in Italy, but knew enough about what was going on in physics to have sent his older brother a card in 1944, saying simply, ''Hurry up!''

Dr. Wheeler interrupted a sabbatical in Paris in 1950 to come back to the United States and help Dr. Edward Teller develop a hydrogen bomb. For his pains Dr. Wheeler was once officially reprimanded by President Dwight D. Eisenhower for losing a classified document on a train, but he was later honored by President Lyndon B. Johnson in a White House ceremony.

Gates of Time  Paradoxical Visions Of Cosmic Dead End

Back in academia, Dr. Wheeler found himself being lured away from nuclear physics by the theories of another Princeton resident, Einstein. The two occasionally talked about quantum theory, which Einstein found abhorrently random, but what intrigued Dr. Wheeler was Einstein's theory of relativity.

Gravity, according to Einstein's vision, was just the geometry of space-time, warped or ''curved'' in the presence of matter or energy, the way a mattress sags under a hefty sleeper.

The part that interested Dr. Wheeler most was an apocalyptic prediction contained within the equations: matter, say in a dead star, could collapse into a heap so dense that light could not even escape from it, eventually squeezing itself out of existence. At the center, space would be infinitely curved, and as Dr. Wheeler likes to say, ''smoke pours out of the computer.'' Space, time and even the laws of physics themselves would break down at this cosmic dead end, called a singularity.

Dr. Wheeler made it his mission to alert the rest of his colleagues to the paradoxical vision of physics predicting its own demise. Dr. Wheeler made Princeton the center of research in general relativity, a field that had been moribund because of its remoteness from laboratory experiment, in the United States.

''He rejuvenated general relativity,'' said Dr. Freeman Dyson, a theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study, across town in Princeton.

It was not until 1967, at a conference in New York City, that Dr. Wheeler, adopting a suggestion shouted from the audience, hit upon the name ''black hole'' to dramatize this dire possibility for a star and for physics.

The black hole ''teaches us that space can be crumpled like a piece of paper into an infinitesimal dot, that time can be extinguished like a blown-out flame, and that the laws of physics that we regard as 'sacred,' as immutable, are anything but,'' he later said in his 1998 autobiography, ''Geons, Black Holes &amp; Quantum Foam: A Life in Physics,'' written with Dr. Kenneth Ford, a former student and the retired director of the American Institute of Physics.

Moreover, Dr. Wheeler preached, the breakdown of physics could not be sealed away in a distant dead star. He pointed out that even space and time had to pay their dues to the uncertainty principle. When viewed on very small scales or in the compressed throes of the Big Bang, what looked so smooth and continuous, like an ocean from an airplane, would become discontinuous, dissolving like a dry sand castle into a mess of unconnected points and worm holes that Dr. Wheeler dubbed ''quantum foam.''

In a sense, black holes, or ''gates of time,'' as he later called them, were everywhere, under our fingernails, courtesy of the uncertainty principle, and thus so was the issue of where the laws of physics came from.

By the 1970's Dr. Wheeler was ready to move on. Faced with mandatory retirement from teaching at Princeton, he moved to the University of Texas, where he turned to the very small, that is to say, the quantum, with the energy and eloquence that he had once lavished on black holes.

''Relativity is exciting but it's not surprising, it's not peculiar,'' he once told Dr. Ford. ''Quantum theory remains a mystery; it's a greater challenge for the 21st century.''

One idea that he and his Texas colleagues investigated was the notion that the universe is a giant computer and that quantum theory can somehow be derived from information theory, the logic of bits and bytes.

The work goes on, and will be one of the main items of discussion in Princeton this weekend.

It From Bit  Einstein's Words Are Set in Stone

Told that he had to slow down after bypass surgery, Dr. Wheeler moved to a retirement home near Princeton in 1986.

On his way to lunch recently Dr. Wheeler took a visitor on a detour through the old brick building once known as Fine Hall, now Jones Hall, pointing out the offices that he, Einstein and Bohr had occupied in 1939.

Across the hall was a lounge with rows of windows, leather couches and a fireplace with an inscription from Einstein on the mantelpiece. ''Raffiniert ist der Herr Gott, aber Boshaft ist er nicht,'' Dr. Wheeler said, reading. Then he translated, roughly, ''God is clever, but he's not malicious.''

Asked if he agreed, Dr. Wheeler nodded, then pumped his fist in affirmation.

Back in his office Dr. Wheeler busied himself at the blackboard with a diagram that is emblematic of quantum weirdness, and of his hope for constructing the universe and its laws ''higgledy-piggledy,'' as he likes to call it, out of nothing.

It is called double slit experiment. In it an electron or any other particle flies toward a screen with a pair of slits. Past the screen is a physicist with a choice of two experiments. One will show that the electron was a particle and passed through one or another slit; the other will show that it was a wave and passed through both slits, producing an interference pattern. The electron will turn out to be one or the other depending on the experimenter's choice.

That was weird enough, but in 1978 Dr. Wheeler pointed out that the experimenter could wait until after the electron would have passed the slits before deciding which detector to employ and thus whether it had been a particle or wave. In effect, in this ''delayed choice'' experiment, the physicists would be participating in creating the past.

In a 1993 paper Dr. Wheeler likened such a particle to a ''great smoky dragon,'' whose tail was at the entrance slits of the chamber and its teeth at the detector, but in between -- before it had been ''registered'' in some detector as a phenomenon -- was just a cloud, smoky probability.

Perhaps the past itself is such a smoky dragon awaiting our perception.

He wonders if the delayed choice experiment is a prescription for how the universe can be built up from information, as in a cosmic game of 20 questions, a series of yes-no decisions resulting from billions upon billions of quantum observations. It's a concept that has gone by many names over the last few decades from ''genesis by observership'' to ''participatory universe'' to the current fashion, ''it from bit.''

Typically there is a diagram, a cartoon actually, which consists of a giant U with an eyeball on top of one stem looking back at the other. The skinny unadorned end of the U is the Big Bang, he explained, tracing his finger along the loop.

''The model of the universe starts out all skinny and then gets bigger,'' he said. ''Finally it gives rise to life and the mind and the power to observe, and by the act of observation of those first days, we give reality to those first days.''

An excerpt dated Jan. 29, 2002, from Dr. Wheeler's journal reads: ''No space, no time, no gravity, no electromagnetism, no particles. Nothing. We are back where Plato, Aristotle and Parmenides struggled with the great questions: How Come the Universe, How Come Us, How Come Anything? But happily also we have around the answer to these questions. That's us.''

It's a gaudy notion even for an adventurer like Dr. Wheeler.

But as Dr. Thorne pointed out, Dr. Wheeler's track record with crazy ideas is surprisingly good. One such idea had led to a Nobel Prize for Dr. Wheeler's graduate student Dr. Richard Feynman, the noted Caltech physicist. Dr. Thorne recalled Dr. Feynman's telling him once, ''Some people think Wheeler's gotten crazy in his later years, but he's always been crazy.''

	Coffee as a Health Drink? Studies Find Some Benefits


Coffee is not usually thought of as health food, but a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink. Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious ailments, including diabetes, heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver.

Among them is a systematic review of studies published last year in The Journal of the American Medical Association, which concluded that habitual coffee consumption was consistently associated with a lower risk of Type 2 diabetes. Exactly why is not known, but the authors offered several explanations.

Coffee contains antioxidants that help control the cell damage that can contribute to the development of the disease. It is also a source of chlorogenic acid, which has been shown in animal experiments to reduce glucose concentrations.

Caffeine, perhaps coffee's most famous component, seems to have little to do with it; studies that looked at decaffeinated coffee alone found the same degree of risk reduction.

Larger quantities of coffee seem to be especially helpful in diabetes prevention. In a report that combined statistical data from many studies, researchers found that people who drank four to six cups of coffee a day had a 28 percent reduced risk compared with people who drank two or fewer. Those who drank more than six had a 35 percent risk reduction.

Some studies show that cardiovascular risk also decreases with coffee consumption. Using data on more than 27,000 women ages 55 to 69 in the Iowa Women's Health Study who were followed for 15 years, Norwegian researchers found that women who drank one to three cups a day reduced their risk of cardiovascular disease by 24 percent compared with those drinking no coffee at all.

But as the quantity increased, the benefit decreased. At more than six cups a day, the risk was not significantly reduced. Still, after controlling for age, smoking and alcohol consumption, women who drank one to five cups a day -- caffeinated or decaffeinated -- reduced their risk of death from all causes during the study by 15 to 19 percent compared with those who drank none.

The findings, which appeared in May in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, suggest that antioxidants in coffee may dampen inflammation, reducing the risk of disorders related to it, like cardiovascular disease. Several compounds in coffee may contribute to its antioxidant capacity, including phenols, volatile aroma compounds and oxazoles that are efficiently absorbed.

In another analysis, published in July in the same journal, researchers found that a typical serving of coffee contains more antioxidants than typical servings of grape juice, blueberries, raspberries and oranges.

''We were surprised to learn that coffee quantitatively is the major contributor of antioxidants in the diet both in Norway and in the U.S.A.,'' said Rune Blomhoff, the senior author of both studies and a professor of nutrition at the University of Oslo.

These same anti-inflammatory properties may explain why coffee appears to decrease the risk of alcohol-related cirrhosis and liver cancer. This effect was first observed in 1992. Recent studies, published in June in The Archives of Internal Medicine, confirmed the finding.

Still, some experts believe that coffee drinking, and particularly caffeine consumption, can have negative health consequences. A study published in January in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology, for example, suggests that the amount of caffeine in two cups of coffee significantly decreases blood flow to the heart, particularly during exercise at high altitude.

Rob van Dam, a Harvard scientist and the lead author of The Journal of the American Medical Association review, acknowledged that caffeine could increase blood pressure and slightly increase levels of the amino acid homocysteine, possibly raising the risk for heart disease.

''I wouldn't advise people to increase their consumption of coffee in order to lower their risk of disease,'' Dr. van Dam said, ''but the evidence is that for most people without specific conditions, coffee is not detrimental to health. If people enjoy drinking it, it's comforting to know that they don't have to be afraid of negative health effects.''

	You Are Also What You Drink


What worries you most? Decaying teeth, thinning bones, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, cancer, obesity? Whatever tops your list, you may be surprised to know that all of these health problems are linked to the beverages you drink -- or don't drink.

Last year, with the support of the Unilever Health Institute in the Netherlands (Unilever owns Lipton Tea), a panel of experts on nutrition and health published a ''Beverage Guidance System'' in hopes of getting people to stop drinking their calories when those calories contribute little or nothing to their health and may actually detract from it.

The panel, led by Barry M. Popkin, a nutrition professor at the University of North Carolina, was distressed by the burgeoning waistlines of Americans and the contribution that popular beverages make to weight problems. But the experts also reviewed 146 published reports to find the best evidence for the effects of various beverages on nearly all of the above health problems. I looked into a few others, and what follows is a summary of what we all found.

At the head of the list of preferred drinks is -- you guessed it -- water. No calories, no hazards, only benefits. But the panel expressed concern about bottled water fortified with nutrients, saying that consumers may think they don't need to eat certain nutritious foods, which contain substances like fiber and phytochemicals lacking in these waters. (You can just imagine what the panel would have to say about vitamin-fortified sodas, which Coca-Cola and Pepsi plan to introduce in the coming months.)

Sweet Liquid Calories

About 21 percent of calories consumed by Americans over the age of 2 come from beverages, predominantly soft drinks and fruit drinks with added sugars, the panel said in its report. There has been a huge increase in sugar-sweetened drinks in recent decades, primarily at the expense of milk, which has clear nutritional benefits. The calories from these sugary drinks account for half the rise in caloric intake by Americans since the late 1970s.

Not only has the number of servings of these drinks risen, but serving size has ballooned, as well, with some retail outlets offering 32 ounces and free refills.

Add the current passion for smoothies and sweetened coffee drinks (there are 240 calories in a 16-ounce Starbucks Caffe Mocha without the whipped cream), and you can see why people are drinking themselves into XXXL sizes.

But calories from sweet drinks are not the only problem. The other matter cited by the panel, in its report in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, is that beverages have ''weak satiety properties'' -- they do little or nothing to curb your appetite -- and people do not compensate for the calories they drink by eating less.

Furthermore, some soft drinks contribute to other health problems. The American Academy of General Dentistry says that noncola carbonated beverages and canned (sweetened) iced tea harm tooth enamel, especially when consumed apart from meals. And a study of 2,500 adults in Framingham, Mass., linked cola consumption (regular and diet) to the thinning of hip bones in women.

If you must drink something sweet, the panel suggested a no-calorie beverage like diet soda prepared with an approved sweetener, though the experts recognized a lack of long-term safety data and the possibility that these drinks ''condition'' people to prefer sweetness.

Fruit juices are also a sweet alternative, although not nearly as good as whole fruits, which are better at satisfying hunger.

Coffee, Tea and Caffeine

Here the news is better. Several good studies have linked regular coffee consumption to a reduced risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and, in men and in women who have not taken postmenopausal hormones, Parkinson's disease.

Most studies have not linked a high intake of either coffee or caffeine to heart disease, even though caffeinated coffee raises blood pressure somewhat and boiled unfiltered coffee (French-pressed and espresso) raises harmful LDL and total cholesterol levels.

Caffeine itself is not thought to be a problem for health or water balance in the body, up to 400 milligrams a day (the amount in about 30 ounces of brewed coffee). But pregnant women should limit their intake because more than 300 milligrams a day might increase the risk of miscarriage and low birth weight, the panel said.

Mice prone to an Alzheimer's-like disease were protected by drinking water spiked with caffeine equivalent to what people get from five cups of coffee a day. And a study of more than 600 men suggested that drinking three cups of coffee a day protects against age-related memory and thinking deficits.

For tea, the evidence on health benefits is mixed and sometimes conflicting. Tea lowers cancer risk in experimental animals, but the effects in people are unknown. It may benefit bone density and help prevent kidney stones and tooth decay. And four or five cups of black tea daily helps arteries expand and thus may improve blood flow to the heart.

Alcohol

Alcohol is a classic case of ''a little may be better than none but a lot is worse than a little.'' Moderate consumption -- one drink a day for women and two for men -- has been linked in many large, long-term studies to lower mortality rates, especially from heart attacks and strokes, and may also lower the risk of Type 2 diabetes and gallstones. The panel found no convincing evidence that one form of alcohol, including red wine, was better than another.

But alcohol even at moderate intakes raises the risk of birth defects and breast cancer, possibly because it interferes with folate, an essential B vitamin. And heavy alcohol consumption is associated with several lethal cancers, cirrhosis of the liver, hemorrhagic stroke, hypertension, dementia and some forms of heart disease.

Dairy and Soy Drinks

Here my reading of the evidence differs slightly from that of the panel, which rated low-fat and skim milk third, below water and coffee and tea, as a preferred drink and said dairy drinks were not essential to a healthy diet. The panel acknowledged the benefits of milk for bone density, while noting that unless people continue to drink it, the benefit to bones of the calcium and vitamin D in milk is not maintained.

Other essential nutrients in milk include magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, vitamin A, riboflavin, folate and protein -- about eight grams in an eight-ounce glass. A 10-year study of overweight individuals found that milk drinkers were less likely to develop metabolic syndrome, a constellation of coronary risk factors that includes hypertension and low levels of protective HDLs. To me, this says you may never outgrow your need for milk.

The panel emphasized the need for children and teenagers to drink more milk and fewer calorically sweetened beverages.

''Fortified soy milk is a good alternative for individuals who prefer not to consume cow milk,'' the panel said, but cautioned that soy milk cannot be legally fortified with vitamin D and provides only 75 percent of the calcium the body obtains from cow's milk.

PERSONAL HEALTH

Correction:  March 31, 2007, Saturday  The Personal Health column in Science Times on Tuesday about healthful beverages included incorrect information from the Beverage Guidance Panel about soy milk. It can indeed be legally fortified with vitamin D.

	Despite Lacking Latest Virus, Flu Vaccine Is Thought to Work


The influenza vaccine now being given was not developed to protect against a strain of the virus that has surfaced in this country this fall, but the government is optimistic that this year's vaccine will stave off outbreaks, a top federal health official said yesterday.

The reason is that animal studies suggest that the strains of virus included in the vaccine are close enough to the new one that the vaccine will still protect, said the official, Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.

Still, she warned, the United States could face a severe epidemic this year, given that the flu season began unusually early and has hit Texas and Colorado particularly hard.

''It's a little too early to say whether or not this portends the worst flu season we have had in a long time,'' Dr. Gerberding said in a telephone news conference. Her agency is responsible for tracking and controlling influenza and other infectious diseases.

She said she was ''sounding the alarm'' to urge more people to get flu shots to ''nip this problem in the bud.'' The center does not know how many people have received flu shots this season. ''People have the impression we are doing better this year than last year, but we do not have the data to back that up at this point in time,'' she said.

The flu vaccine includes three strains of influenza virus, but was not designed to protect against a new one that has appeared in a number of countries over the last year. It is known as the Fujian strain, a variant of the Panama strain that is included in the current vaccine. Both are categorized as H3N2 strains that have been linked to higher rates of serious illness requiring admission to a hospital and to death, Dr. Gerberding said.

Each year, influenza causes 114,000 hospital admissions and 36,000 deaths.

The influenza virus mutates frequently. Health officials change the strains of virus put in the flu vaccine each year as they try to keep up with mutations. But matching strains in the vaccine with those circulating among humans during a flu season is a notoriously unpredictable exercise.

The World Health Organization committee that makes the recommendations for the flu vaccine knew about the Fujian strain in February, said Dr. Klaus Stöhr, an influenza expert at the organization. But Dr. Stöhr said in a recent interview that the committee decided not to include the Fujian strain because scientists could not make it pure enough in time for a human vaccine.

The flu vaccine is prepared in eggs. Decisions about the components of the vaccine have to be made months in advance in part because manufacturers and farmers need to know how many eggs to prepare in anticipation of demand.

Influenza typically occurs during the winter in each hemisphere, and the vaccines are prepared at different times. The vaccine being prepared for use in the Southern Hemisphere will include the Fujian strain, Dr. Stöhr said.

''There may be less than optimal protection against H3N2'' in the Northern Hemisphere, ''but no vaccine failure has been reported'' there, he said. ''So there is no reason to discourage people from getting vaccinated.''

Dr. Gerberding said it was common for the circulating influenza to gradually change genetically -- known as ''drift'' -- as it spread to infect more people.

Tests at the center found that 84 percent of the 55 strains of influenza virus isolated this fall are the Fujian strain, Dr. Gerberding said. But she emphasized that protection could still occur even without a perfect match.

Dr. Gerberding said that an earlier than usual onset of the flu had occurred in some European countries but that ''this is not a pandemic.''

	AVIAN FLU VACCINE CALLED EFFECTIVE IN HUMAN TESTING


Government scientists say they have successfully tested in people a vaccine that they believe can protect against the strain of avian influenza that is spreading in birds through Asia and Russia.

Health officials have been racing to develop a vaccine because they worry that if that strain mutated and combined with a human influenza virus to create a new virus, it could spread rapidly through the world. (The vaccine cannot lead to such a situation because it is made from killed virus.)

Tens of millions of birds have died from infection with the virus and culling to prevent the spread of the virus. About 100 people have been infected, and about 50 have died from this strain of the avian influenza virus, called A(H5N1). So far there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission, but that is what health officials fear, because it could cause a pandemic. And that fear has driven the intense research to develop a vaccine.

The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, said that although the vaccine that had undergone preliminary tests could be used on an emergency basis if a pandemic developed, it would still be several months before that vaccine was tested further and, if licensed, offered to the public.

''It's good news,'' Dr. Fauci said. ''We have a vaccine.''

But he cautioned: ''We don't have all the vaccine we need to meet the possible demand. The critical issue now is, can we make enough vaccine, given the well-known inability of the vaccine industry to make enough vaccine?''

An earlier human vaccine against the A(H5N1) avian influenza virus was prepared after it first appeared in the world, in Hong Kong in 1997. That vaccine was never fully developed or used, and the strain has mutated since then.

In interviews over recent days, Dr. Fauci has said that tests so far had shown that the new vaccine produced a strong immune response among the small group of healthy adults under age 65 who volunteered to receive it, although the doses needed were higher than in the standard influenza vaccine offered each year. The vaccine, developed with genetic engineering techniques, is intended to protect against infection, not to treat those who are sick.

Further tests are expected to be conducted among two groups -- people 65 and older, and children -- over the next several months. Dr. Fauci expressed confidence that they would confirm the success of the first tests and answer remaining scientific questions.

Because the vaccine is made in chicken eggs, ''a potential major stumbling block'' to successful mass production is the number of eggs farmers can supply manufacturers, Dr. Fauci said.

If manufacturers can overcome such hurdles, the new vaccine could go far in averting a possible pandemic of human influenza, Dr. Fauci said.

Only a small number of human cases of A(H5N1) influenza have been found. Although a few cases may have been transmitted from person to person in Asia, the A(H5N1) strain has not garnered enough strength to spread widely among humans anywhere.

As of Friday night, according to the World Health Organization in Geneva, the avian strain has killed 57 of the 112 people it has been known to infect in four countries. They are Cambodia (4 cases), Indonesia (one case), Thailand (17 cases) and Vietnam (90 cases).

The additional tests are needed in part to determine the optimal dose of vaccine; how many shots people will need for protection; and whether adding another ingredient called an adjuvant to the vaccine could raise the potency of lower doses, stretching the number of people that could be protected. Even when these tests are completed, more time will be needed before the Food and Drug Administration can license the human vaccine and before policy makers determine when and how it should be administered.

Government researchers and others developed the vaccine, which is produced by Sanofi-Pasteur, a French vaccine company that is now part of Aventis. The government could decide to release the product under emergency conditions if an A(H5N1) influenza pandemic struck before the testing process was completed.

Although cautioning that the vaccine had not been fully tested, Dr. Fauci said that the initial test findings had given the federal government enough confidence to start the process of adding millions more doses of the vaccine to the 2 million it had bought. The present supply is stored in bulk form, and ''we cannot put it in vials until we find out what the right dose is,'' Dr. Fauci said.

The manufacturer needs to know the dose and regimen to determine how much more vaccine it can produce and make available to the United States and other customers.

Scientists had to test the human avian influenza vaccine on volunteers because the A(H5N1) strain differed in significant ways from the conventional strains that cause human influenza.

Also, the influenza shots that are offered each year are derived from the human strains that are circulating most widely at the time experts choose the components of the next vaccine. Human influenza viruses mutate enough each year to force changes in the standard vaccines. Such vaccines produce a broader and stronger immunity because recipients build up an immunity to influenza from repeated immunizations and exposure to the influenza virus.

In a sense, the standard annual influenza shots are booster doses. But the A(H5N1) vaccine is a primary immunization because, having had no exposure to that virus, people lack any immunity to the avian strain.

The United States is thought to be the only country that has produced a human vaccine against the A(H5N1) influenza strain. Australia, Canada, France and Japan are among countries where scientists are trying to develop human avian influenza vaccines, according to the World Health Organization.

Dr. Fauci's institute also contracted with the Chiron Corporation, which is based in Emeryville, Calif. to make another A(H5N1) vaccine. But tests of the Chiron vaccine have not started because of delays related to prior contamination found in Chiron's plants.

Dr. Fauci said his institute had 8,000 doses of the Chiron human A(H5N1) vaccine and hoped to start testing it in volunteers in late fall. The tests will follow the same steps taken with the Sanofi-Pasteur vaccine, he said.

	Study Finds H.I.V. Infection Is High for Young Gay Men


The first large-scale study of H.I.V. infection among young gay men in New York City has found that large numbers have become infected with the virus in the last two years, with the levels of infection among young black men exceeding those among whites and Hispanic men.

The results of the Young Men's Survey, conducted by the New York City Health Department and the New York City Blood Center, indicated that 12 percent of their sample of 15-  to 22-year-old men who have sex with men are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.

Interviews with 545 men who have sex with men were conducted last year in dance clubs, businesses and street locations throughout the city. The survey, which was financed by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is one of a series in nine urban areas throughout the country. Though the surveys began in 1994, New York City participated for the first time last year.

The study found that 46 percent of the respondents reported that they had unprotected anal sex within the last six months, placing them at high risk for acquiring and transmitting H.I.V. Young black men were most heavily affected. Eighteen percent of young African-American men and 16 percent of gay men of mixed race in the survey were H.I.V. positive, while the infection rates were 9 percent among young Hispanic men and 3 percent among young white men, according to the Health Department.

''It certainly is a cause for concern,'' Dr. Mary Ann Chiasson, the assistant commissioner of Disease Intervention Research at the city's Health Department, said of the findings. ''It tells us exactly what kind of high-risk behavior this particular group of men is engaging in. It allows us to focus prevention where prevention is needed the most.''

Dr. Chiasson said yesterday that the study did not answer the question of whether high-risk behavior was on the rise among young gay men in New York City. She said the study was specifically intended to look at the prevalence of H.I.V. infection and current behavior of this particular group of young men, instead of changes in their behavior over time.

The study's results were announced at the recent Sixth Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Chicago.

Researchers said the racial and ethnic disparities in H.I.V. infection levels reflected nationwide trends.

The H.I.V. infection rate among the young men who previously had a sexually transmitted disease was 23 percent, while it was 10 percent among those without such a history.

Two-thirds of those participating in the survey reported that they had also had sex with women.

In San Francisco, similar behavioral surveys among men who have sex with men indicate that there have been increases in unsafe sexual behavior and rectal gonorrhea from 1994 to 1997, according to a weekly report published last month by the Centers for Disease Control.

In the New York City survey, about a third of the 15-  to 18-year-olds had had a partner who was older than 30 in the six months prior to participating in the study, while about 45 percent of the 19-  to 22-year-olds had partners older than 30.

''It's more likely that older men are H.I.V. infected than younger men so they may be at a higher risk of transmitting H.I.V.,'' Dr. Chiasson said. ''You see this pattern in sexually transmitted diseases, particularly in young women who are more likely to have older partners.''

Public health officials and advocates for people with AIDS said the survey pointed to the need for more prevention efforts in New York City, which has been one of the hardest-hit cities in the country since the early days of the epidemic.

Dr. Joshua Lipsman, the new executive director of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the nation's largest AIDS service agency, said community groups could not manage without help from government at all levels.

	Study in 6 Cities Finds H.I.V. In 30% of Young Black Gays


Thirty percent of young gay black men are infected with the AIDS virus, according to a study of six large cities in the United States, federal researchers said here today.

The study, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1998 through 2000 in Baltimore, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and Seattle, found that gay black men in their 20's had the highest H.I.V. infection rate of any group in that age range.

The study found that among young gay men, 15 percent of Hispanics, 7 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 3 percent of Asian-Americans, are infected with the virus. Over all, the study found that 12.3 percent of gay and bisexual men from 23 to 29 were infected with H.I.V., the AIDS virus.

''The rates are strikingly high and worrisome,'' Dr. Robert Janssen, a co-author of the study, said in an interview. ''We have not been putting adequate resources into gay men of color. And we definitely need to bolster our efforts in reaching them.''

The study also found that gay and bisexual men in their 20's of all races were engaging in behavior that put them at high risk for AIDS, said federal researchers who presented the findings at the Eighth Annual Retrovirus Meeting here today.

A total of 46 percent of participants said they had had unprotected anal intercourse in the preceding six months. Officials at the centers called the figure ''alarming'' because the men grew up and went to school in an era when widespread publicity and prevention efforts were directed at AIDS. Many older gay men became infected before AIDS was recognized. The disease was first detected in 1981 when the men in the new study were 3 to 9 years old.

A similar study by the centers from 1994 to 1998 found that 7 percent of 15-  to 22-year-old gay and bisexual men were infected by H.I.V., Dr. Janssen said. That study found that 14 percent of the blacks were infected, 7 percent of the Hispanics and 3 percent of the non-Hispanic whites. In recent years, about 40,000 Americans have become newly infected each year, with blacks accounting for slightly more than half of the new cases. At the height of the epidemic in the early 1980's, there were more than 150,000 new infections annually.

But because the newer and earlier studies focused on different age groups, there was no way to determine whether the percentage of new infections in each group was rising, Dr. Janssen said in an interview.

However, a number of other studies have shown small but significant increases in rates of gonorrhea, syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections. Epidemiologists use such infections as behavior markers for the risk of new H.I.V. infections in a community because of a strong correlation of H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted diseases among infected individuals. Also, sexually transmitted infections can make it easier for H.I.V. to enter the body.

Health officials also expressed concern that of the 293 infected men in the study, only 29 percent knew they were infected. Fewer than one-fourth were receiving medical care or anti-H.I.V. therapy.

Health officials suspect that a substantial proportion of current H.I.V. transmission is from people who do not know they are infected.

San Francisco, which used a recently developed test to detect recent H.I.V. infections, is the only city in the nation that has reported an increase in infections among gay and bisexual men in recent years. The test is available only for research purposes. But Dr. Janssen expressed hope that it could be used more broadly later this year.

Although there is no direct evidence of rising H.I.V. numbers among gay and bisexual men in other areas of the country, the new and earlier studies raise suspicions that such an increase may be occurring, Dr. Janssen said.

In the six cities study, epidemiologists surveyed more than 2,400 men at bars and other places frequented by young gay men and conducted extensive interviews.

The prevalence of infection ranged from a low of 4.7 percent in Seattle to 18 percent in Dallas, and there was a high level of risky sexual behavior in all six cities.

Gay men remain the largest group of people with AIDS, accounting for about 40 percent of AIDS cases and new infections reported in recent years. Women make up 30 percent.

	Rotavirus Drugs Deemed Safe and Effective


Two new vaccines against rotavirus, the leading known cause of deaths from diarrhea among infants around the world, have proved safe and effective in two of the largest clinical trials in the history of medicine.

Studies of the two vaccines, one made by Merck and one by GlaxoSmithKline, are to be published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. Each trial enrolled more than 60,000 infants, in part to avoid the fate that befell the last licensed rotavirus vaccine, which was withdrawn seven years ago after it was blamed for dangerous bowel obstructions in 1 in 10,000 children.

''The results to date are very optimistic, very promising,'' said Dr. Samuel L. Katz, a professor of pediatrics at Duke University and former chairman of the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. ''The real test will be in the global health arena, and if they are as safe and effective as they seem to be, they'll be remarkably helpful.''

The two companies said they were taking their vaccines to rich and poor countries, but with different strategies: the Glaxo vaccine is already in use in Brazil, the Philippines and other developing countries, and it is close to licensing in Europe, but the company has not yet applied to sell it in the United States. The Merck vaccine may be available here as early as spring; then the company will seek licenses in Europe and in some poor countries. Merck and Glaxo say they are starting clinical trials in very poor countries in Africa and Asia.

Globally, rotavirus kills as many as 600,000 children a year -- about half as many as malaria kills -- and the World Health Organization has eagerly sought a vaccine.

Nearly all children everywhere catch the virus by age 5, and most cases are mild. But severe cases can erupt into a combination of watery diarrhea and constant vomiting that leads to severe dehydration. Better diets and intravenous rehydration nearly always save children in the West, and only about 20 children a year die of rotavirus infections in the United States. But about 100,000 die of it in India each year, and 1,000 in Mexico.

Even in the United States, the virus sends 55,000 infants to the hospital each year. Dr. Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and one of the developers of the Merck vaccine, said rotavirus symptoms were among the most common causes of admissions to his hospital in winter. He described an infant he knew of who had developed the virus overnight and collapsed into semi-consciousness the next day as her mother was stuck in a traffic jam trying to reach a suburban Philadelphia hospital. The child's veins were so shrunken that a surgeon had to be called to get an intravenous line into a neck vein. ''In Botswana, that child would have died,'' Dr. Offit said.

In 1999, Wyeth pulled its rotavirus vaccine, Rotashield, from the American market after it was blamed for very rare cases of intussusception, in which a section of the gut collapses into itself like a telescope. A child with it may begin screaming in pain and may develop persistent vomiting and produce black stools.

A later National Institutes of Health study argued that Rotashield might not have been responsible -- intussusception can happen spontaneously for unknown reasons -- but by then the damage had been done. Once the vaccine was ruled unsafe for Americans, it was politically impossible to offer it in poor countries, even though it might have saved hundreds of thousands of lives while possibly being to blame for a handful of deaths.

That history was responsible for creating such large clinical trials.

Glaxo's vaccine, called Rotarix, and Merck's, called Rotateq, showed low intussusception rates and no difference between children who got the vaccine and those who got a placebo.

Also, both are oral vaccines using weakened live virus, like the polio vaccine used in poor countries. Such vaccines are easier to use than vaccines requiring needles and may give longer immunity.

Glaxo tested its vaccine on children from poor and middle-income families in Latin America, while Merck's trial was conducted largely in wealthy countries, including the United States and Finland, though it included children in Jamaica and Mexico. The Glaxo vaccine prevented severe rotavirus disease in 85 percent of children while the Merck vaccine prevented it in 98 percent.

But the two vaccines may be equally effective, said Dr. Roger I. Glass, a vaccine specialist at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who compared the studies. That is because the two defined ''severe'' slightly differently and because the two test populations were different -- the poorer children in the Glaxo trial were presumably more likely to be malnourished and to have other competing viruses in their intestines, he said.

In what he called ''a particularly exciting finding of great importance to public health,'' both vaccines substantially reduced hospitalization for all diarrheas. That suggests that rotavirus may cause more illness than had been realized -- most diarrhea victims, even in the United States, are never tested to find the cause -- so a vaccine may do much more good than doctors had hoped.

Each vaccine has advantages and disadvantages, specialists said.

Glaxo's is made from a weakened human strain, and is delivered in two doses. Merck's is a bovine strain with bits of genetic material from five human ones. It takes three doses. As a result, the Glaxo vaccine will presumably be cheaper and easier for poor countries.

Global prices are still being negotiated. Brazil offers the vaccine free to all children, so Glaxo sells to the Brazilian government for $15 for the two doses. It sells to the private sector in Mexico for $100 and expects to sell it in Europe for more than $100, Jean Stéphenne, president of Glaxo's vaccine division, said. Prices are ''a function of the G.D.P. of different countries,'' he said, and higher for private doctors than to public clinics. If an agency like the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization that buys for poor countries puts in large enough orders, Mr. Stéphenne said, it might get a price as low as or lower than Brazil's.

Dr. Glass of the disease control centers said the emergence of two effective vaccines was ''wonderful.''

''I've been working on rotavirus for 25 years,'' he said. ''Everyone gets excited about SARS or Ebola or Marburg, but they haven't killed half a million people in a decade, and this is a disease that kills half a million a year.''

	New Vaccine Said to Offer Hope Against Deadly Bacterium


A new vaccine tested in West Africa could save the lives of thousands of poor rural children who die each year from bacterial infections, a team of scientists reported yesterday.

The vaccine is a strengthened version of Prevnar, which has been given widely to American infants since 2000 and prevents rare but serious infections with the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterium.

In the third world, the same germ is a major killer, and the new vaccine, tested in Gambia, ''exceeded our expectations,'' said Dr. Orin Levine, head of the pneumonia vaccine program at the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, which backed the trial.

The results are to be published today in The Lancet, a British medical publication.

''No one expected so big a reduction in pneumonia, hospitalization and mortality,'' Dr. Levine said. ''Most people don't know it, but pneumococcal disease kills more people every year than malaria. In this trial, we prevented one death for every 200 children we vaccinated. That's a whopping public-health contribution.''

Susan McKinney, an immunization expert at the United States Agency for International Development, which spends hundreds of millions of dollars on vaccines for poor countries, said her agency was ''delighted'' with the trial. ''The impact this vaccine could have in developing countries is fantastic,'' she said.

How cheaply it can be made remains to be seen, but experts were optimistic yesterday that poor countries would eventually get regular supplies.

Lisa Jacobs, a spokeswoman for the alliance, known as GAVI, said: ''This is exactly the kind of opportunity GAVI is looking for. I can't say definitely that GAVI will fund this -- the board has to make that decision. But given that this data is so promising, we'll definitely look at this.''

The alliance was created in 2000 as a partnership of donor governments, private foundations, the World Health Organization and drug companies to make vaccines broadly available at low cost. It has received $1.5 billion from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, $300 million from the United States and hundreds of millions more from other donors.

In the United States, Prevnar, made by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals of Collegeville, Pa., costs about $250 for a course of four shots -- far more than poor countries can afford or donors will pay.

Natalie deVane, a Wyeth spokeswoman, said the company was negotiating a price for standard Prevnar with the Gambian government and would work with GAVI in the future on the strengthened vaccine.

It is common, several experts said, for vaccine makers to sell at high prices in the West to recoup their research costs, then offer the products at bargain prices in poor countries.

For example, said Dr. Levine, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University Medical school, a vaccine used in poor countries that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B and haemophilus influenza B in one shot is purchased by the Global Alliance for $3.65 a dose, a fraction of what similar shots cost in the West.

The vaccine tested in Gambia, made up especially by Wyeth for the trial, had antigens against nine strains of the bacterium. Prevnar has antigens against seven strains. Ms. deVane said Wyeth was now making one with antigens against 13 strains.

It is being tested for safety and for its ability to provoke an immune response, but presumably will not require another $30 million clinical trial in 17,000 children, like the one in Gambia.

Dr. Paul A. Offit, chief of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, who was not connected to the study, said the vaccine's 77 percent success rate at preventing diseases caused by the type of bacteria in the vaccine was ''excellent.''

There are 90 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, he said, but the majority of infections are caused by a few strains. Prevnar was approved in the United States after it was tested on 38,000 children in northern California.

But vaccines that work in the West often do not work in poor countries with open sewers, tropical heat and urban crowding. In Africa, for example, it can take 10 doses of polio vaccine to achieve the same immunity that three doses will give in the United States because there are so many similar viruses in the African environment that can attach themselves to the same cell receptors as the vaccine.

The chief author of the study, Dr. Felicity Cutts, a professor of epidemiology at Britain's Medical Research Council, said the fact that the vaccine had cut deaths among Gambian children by 16 percent was ''a nice and unexpected result.''

Correction:  March 30, 2005, Wednesday  An article on Friday about a large clinical trial that found the vaccine Prevnar to be effective against deadly bacterial infections among children in West Africa misstated an affiliation for Dr. Orin Levine, executive director of the pneumonia vaccine program at the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization. He is a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, not the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

	Is Chemistry Destiny?


Over the past several weeks, I've found I can change the conversation at any social gathering by mentioning Louann Brizendine's book, ''The Female Brain.'' Brizendine is a neuropsychiatrist and the founder of the Women's and Teen Girls' Mood and Hormone Clinic in San Francisco. She's written a breezy -- maybe too breezy -- summary of hundreds of studies on the neurological differences between men and women.

All human beings, she writes, start out with a brain that looks female. But around the eighth week in the womb, testosterone surges through male brains, killing cells in some regions (communications) and growing cells in others (sex and aggression).

By the time they are three months old, girls are, on average, much better at making eye contact with other people and picking up information from faces. During play, girls look back at their mothers, on average, 10 to 20 times more than boys, to check for emotional signals. Girls can also, on average, hear a broader range of sounds in the human voice, and can better discern changes in tone.

Later, girls are much more likely to use sentences that begin with ''Let's '' while playing: Let's do this or Let's do that. They are more likely to take turns. Brizendine argues that of course culture and environment powerfully shape behavior, but brain structure and chemistry incline girls to pursue certain goals: ''To forge connection, to create community, and to organize and orchestrate a girl's world so that she's at the center of it.''

During adolescence, the female brain is washed in estrogen. Female teenagers, in general, experience an intense desire for social connection, which releases near-orgasmic rushes of oxytocin in the brain. They are, on average, more sensitive to stress (by age 15, girls are twice as likely to suffer from depression). The male brain, meanwhile, is producing 10 times more testosterone than the female brain, meaning the male sex drive is, on average, much greater.

Brizendine then describes waves of hormonal activity as women age. Female brains vary with the seasons of life much more than male brains. During menopause, for example, estrogen levels drop. Personalities can change as some women derive less pleasure from nurturing and more from independence. Women initiate 65 percent of divorces after age 50.

These sorts of stark sex differences were once highly controversial, and not fit for polite conversation. And some feminists still argue that talking about biological differences between the sexes is akin to talking about biological differences between the races. But Brizendine's feminist bona fides are unquestionable. And in my mostly liberal urban circle -- and among this book's reviewers -- almost everybody takes big biological differences as a matter of course.

Without too much debate or even awareness, there has been a gigantic shift in how people think human behavior is formed.

Consider all the theories put forward to explain personality. Freud argued that early family experiences relating to defecation and genital stimulation created unconscious states that influenced behavior through life. In the 1950's, the common view was that humans begin as nearly blank slates and that behavior is learned through stimulus and response. Over the ages, thinkers have argued that humans are divided between passion and reason, or between the angelic and the demonic.

But now the prevailing view is that brain patterns were established during the millenniums when humans were hunters and gatherers, and we live with the consequences.

Now, it is generally believed, our behavior is powerfully influenced by genes and hormones. Our temperaments are shaped by whether we happened to be born with the right mix of chemicals.

Consciousness has come to be seen as this relatively weak driver, riding atop an organ, the brain, it scarcely understands. When we read that male voles with longer vasopressin genes are more likely to remain monogamous, it seems plausible that so fundamental a quality could be tied to some discrete bit of biology.

This shift in how we see human behavior is bound to have huge effects. Freudianism encouraged people to think about destroying inhibitions. This new understanding both validates ancient stereotypes about the sexes, and fuzzes up moral judgments about human responsibility (biology inclines individuals toward certain virtues and vices).

Once radicals dreamed of new ways of living, but now happiness seems to consist of living in harmony with the patterns that nature and evolution laid down long, long ago.

	The He Hormone


It has a slightly golden hue, suspended in an oily substance and injected in a needle about half as thick as a telephone wire. I have never been able to jab it suddenly in my hip muscle, as the doctor told me to. Instead, after swabbing a small patch of my rump down with rubbing alcohol, I push the needle in slowly until all three inches of it are submerged. Then I squeeze the liquid in carefully, as the muscle often spasms to absorb it. My skin sticks a little to the syringe as I pull it out, and then an odd mix of oil and blackish blood usually trickles down my hip.

I am so used to it now that the novelty has worn off. But every now and again the weirdness returns. The chemical I am putting in myself is synthetic testosterone: a substance that has become such a metaphor for manhood that it is almost possible to forget that it has a physical reality. Twenty years ago, as it surged through my pubescent body, it deepened my voice, grew hair on my face and chest, strengthened my limbs, made me a man. So what, I wonder, is it doing to me now?

There are few things more challenging to the question of what the difference between men and women really is than to see the difference injected into your hip. Men and women differ biologically mainly because men produce 10 to 20 times as much testosterone as most women do, and this chemical, no one seriously disputes, profoundly affects physique, behavior, mood and self-understanding. To be sure, because human beings are also deeply socialized, the impact of this difference is refracted through the prism of our own history and culture. But biology, it is all too easy to forget, is at the root of this process. As more people use testosterone medically, as more use testosterone-based steroids in sports and recreation and as more research explores the behavioral effects of this chemical, the clearer the power of that biology is. It affects every aspect of our society, from high divorce rates and adolescent male violence to the exploding cults of bodybuilding and professional wrestling. It helps explain, perhaps better than any other single factor, why inequalities between men and women remain so frustratingly resilient in public and private life. This summer, when an easy-to-apply testosterone gel hits the market, and when more people experience the power of this chemical in their own bodies, its social importance, once merely implicit, may get even harder to ignore.

My own encounter with testosterone came about for a simple medical reason. I am H.I.V.-positive, and two years ago, after a period of extreme fatigue and weight loss, I had my testosterone levels checked. It turned out that my body was producing far less testosterone than it should have been at my age. No one quite knows why, but this is common among men with long-term H.I.V. The usual treatment is regular injection of artificial testosterone, which is when I experienced my first manhood supplement.

At that point I weighed around 165 pounds. I now weigh 185 pounds. My collar size went from a 15 to a 17 1/2 in a few months; my chest went from 40 to 44. My appetite in every sense of that word expanded beyond measure. Going from napping two hours a day, I now rarely sleep in the daytime and have enough energy for daily workouts and a hefty work schedule. I can squat more than 400 pounds. Depression, once a regular feature of my life, is now a distant memory. I feel better able to recover from life's curveballs, more persistent, more alive. These are the long-term effects. They are almost as striking as the short-term ones.

Because the testosterone is injected every two weeks, and it quickly leaves the bloodstream, I can actually feel its power on almost a daily basis. Within hours, and at most a day, I feel a deep surge of energy. It is less edgy than a double espresso, but just as powerful. My attention span shortens. In the two or three days after my shot, I find it harder to concentrate on writing and feel the need to exercise more. My wit is quicker, my mind faster, but my judgment is more impulsive. It is not unlike the kind of rush I get before talking in front of a large audience, or going on a first date, or getting on an airplane, but it suffuses me in a less abrupt and more consistent way. In a word, I feel braced. For what? It scarcely seems to matter.

And then after a few days, as the testosterone peaks and starts to decline, the feeling alters a little. I find myself less reserved than usual, and more garrulous. The same energy is there, but it seems less directed toward action than toward interaction, less toward pride than toward lust. The odd thing is that, however much experience I have with it, this lust peak still takes me unawares. It is not like feeling hungry, a feeling you recognize and satiate. It creeps up on you. It is only a few days later that I look back and realize that I spent hours of the recent past socializing in a bar or checking out every potential date who came vaguely over my horizon. You realize more acutely than before that lust is a chemical. It comes; it goes. It waxes; it wanes. You are not helpless in front of it, but you are certainly not fully in control.

Then there's anger. I have always tended to bury or redirect my rage. I once thought this an inescapable part of my personality. It turns out I was wrong. Late last year, mere hours after a T shot, my dog ran off the leash to forage for a chicken bone left in my local park. The more I chased her, the more she ran. By the time I retrieved her, the bone had been consumed, and I gave her a sharp tap on her rear end. ''Don't smack your dog!'' yelled a burly guy a few yards away. What I found myself yelling back at him is not printable in this magazine, but I have never used that language in public before, let alone bellow it at the top of my voice. He shouted back, and within seconds I was actually close to hitting him. He backed down and slunk off. I strutted home, chest puffed up, contrite beagle dragged sheepishly behind me. It wasn't until half an hour later that I realized I had been a complete jerk and had nearly gotten into the first public brawl of my life. I vowed to inject my testosterone at night in the future.

That was an extreme example, but other, milder ones come to mind: losing my temper in a petty argument; innumerable traffic confrontations; even the occasional slightly too prickly column or e-mail flame-out. No doubt my previous awareness of the mythology of testosterone had subtly primed me for these feelings of irritation and impatience. But when I place them in the larger context of my new testosterone-associated energy, and of what we know about what testosterone tends to do to people, then it seems plausible enough to ascribe some of this increased edginess and self-confidence to that biweekly encounter with a syringe full of manhood.

Testosterone, oddly enough, is a chemical closely related to cholesterol. It was first isolated by a Dutch scientist in 1935 from mice testicles and successfully synthesized by the German biologist Adolf Butenandt. Although testosterone is often thought of as the definition of maleness, both men and women produce it. Men produce it in their testicles; women produce it in their ovaries and adrenal glands. The male body converts some testosterone to estradiol, a female hormone, and the female body has receptors for testosterone, just as the male body does. That's why women who want to change their sex are injected with testosterone and develop male characteristics, like deeper voices, facial hair and even baldness. The central biological difference between adult men and women, then, is not that men have testosterone and women don't. It's that men produce much, much more of it than women do. An average woman has 40 to 60 nanograms of testosterone in a deciliter of blood plasma. An average man has 300 to 1,000 nanograms per deciliter.

Testosterone's effects start early -- really early. At conception, every embryo is female and unless hormonally altered will remain so. You need testosterone to turn a fetus with a Y chromosome into a real boy, to masculinize his brain and body. Men experience a flood of testosterone twice in their lives: in the womb about six weeks after conception and at puberty. The first fetal burst primes the brain and the body, endowing male fetuses with the instinctual knowledge of how to respond to later testosterone surges. The second, more familiar adolescent rush -- squeaky voices, facial hair and all -- completes the process. Without testosterone, humans would always revert to the default sex, which is female. The Book of Genesis is therefore exactly wrong. It isn't women who are made out of men. It is men who are made out of women. Testosterone, to stretch the metaphor, is Eve's rib.

The effect of testosterone is systemic. It engenders both the brain and the body. Apart from the obvious genital distinction, other differences between men's and women's bodies reflect this: body hair, the ratio of muscle to fat, upper-body strength and so on. But testosterone leads to behavioral differences as well. Since it is unethical to experiment with human embryos by altering hormonal balances, much of the evidence for this idea is based on research conducted on animals. A Stanford research group, for example, as reported in Deborah Blum's book ''Sex on the Brain,'' injected newborn female rats with testosterone. Not only did the female rats develop penises from their clitorises, but they also appeared fully aware of how to use them, trying to have sex with other females with merry abandon. Male rats who had their testosterone blocked after birth, on the other hand, saw their penises wither or disappear entirely and presented themselves to the female rats in a passive, receptive way. Other scientists, theorizing that it was testosterone that enabled male zebra finches to sing, injected mute female finches with testosterone. Sure enough, the females sang. Species in which the female is typically more aggressive, like hyenas in female-run clans, show higher levels of testosterone among the females than among the males. Female sea snipes, which impregnate the males, and leave them to stay home and rear the young, have higher testosterone levels than their mates. Typical ''male'' behavior, in other words, corresponds to testosterone levels, whether exhibited by chromosomal males or females.

Does this apply to humans? The evidence certainly suggests that it does, though much of the ''proof'' is inferred from accidents. Pregnant women who were injected with progesterone (chemically similar to testosterone) in the 1950's to avoid miscarriage had daughters who later reported markedly tomboyish childhoods. Ditto girls born with a disorder that causes their adrenal glands to produce a hormone like testosterone rather than the more common cortisol. The moving story, chronicled in John Colapinto's book ''As Nature Made Him,'' of David Reimer, who as an infant was surgically altered after a botched circumcision to become a girl, suggests how long-lasting the effect of fetal testosterone can be. Despite a ruthless attempt to socialize David as a girl, and to give him the correct hormonal treatment to develop as one, his behavioral and psychological makeup was still ineradicably male. Eventually, with the help of more testosterone, he became a full man again. Female-to-male transsexuals report a similar transformation when injected with testosterone. One, Susan/Drew Seidman, described her experience in The Village Voice last November. ''My sex-drive went through the roof,'' Seidman recalled. ''I felt like I had to have sex once a day or I would die. . . . I was into porn as a girl, but now I'm really into porn.'' For Seidman, becoming a man was not merely physical. Thanks to testosterone, it was also psychological. ''I'm not sure I can tell you what makes a man a man,'' Seidman averred. ''But I know it's not a penis.''

The behavioral traits associated with testosterone are largely the cliche-ridden ones you might expect. The Big T correlates with energy, self-confidence, competitiveness, tenacity, strength and sexual drive. When you talk to men in testosterone therapy, several themes recur. ''People talk about extremes,'' one man in his late 30's told me. ''But that's not what testosterone does for me. It makes me think more clearly. It makes me think more positively. It's my Saint Johnswort.'' A man in his 20's said: ''Usually, I cycle up the hill to my apartment in 12th gear. In the days after my shot, I ride it easily in 16th.'' A 40-year-old executive who took testosterone for bodybuilding purposes told me: ''I walk into a business meeting now and I just exude self-confidence. I know there are lots of other reasons for this, but my company has just exploded since my treatment. I'm on a roll. I feel capable of almost anything.''

When you hear comments like these, it's no big surprise that strutting peacocks with their extravagant tails and bright colors are supercharged with testosterone and that mousy little male sparrows aren't. ''It turned my life around,'' another man said. ''I felt stronger -- and not just in a physical sense. It was a deep sense of being strong, almost spiritually strong.'' Testosterone's antidepressive power is only marginally understood. It doesn't act in the precise way other antidepressants do, and it probably helps alleviate gloominess primarily by propelling people into greater activity and restlessness, giving them less time to think and reflect. (This may be one reason women tend to suffer more from depression than men.) Like other drugs, T can also lose potency if overused. Men who inject excessive amounts may see their own production collapse and experience shrinkage of their testicles and liver damage.

Individual effects obviously vary, and a person's internal makeup is affected by countless other factors -- physical, psychological and external. But in this complex human engine, testosterone is gasoline. It revs you up. A 1997 study took testosterone samples from 125 men and 128 women and selected the 12 with the lowest levels of testosterone and the 15 with the highest. They gave them beepers, asked them to keep diaries and paged them 20 times over a four-day period to check on their actions, feelings, thoughts and whereabouts. The differences were striking. High-testosterone people ''experienced more arousal and tension than those low in testosterone,'' according to the study. ''They spent more time thinking, especially about concrete problems in the immediate present. They wanted to get things done and felt frustrated when they could not. They mentioned friends more than family or lovers.''

Unlike Popeye's spinach, however, testosterone is also, in humans at least, a relatively subtle agent. It is not some kind of on-off switch by which men are constantly turned on and women off. For one thing, we all start out with different base-line levels. Some women may have remarkably high genetic T levels, some men remarkably low, although the male-female differential is so great that no single woman's T level can exceed any single man's, unless she, or he, has some kind of significant hormonal imbalance. For another, and this is where the social and political ramifications get complicated, testosterone is highly susceptible to environment. T levels can rise and fall depending on external circumstances -- short term and long term. Testosterone is usually elevated in response to confrontational situations -- a street fight, a marital spat, a presidential debate -- or in highly charged sexual environments, like a strip bar or a pornographic Web site. It can also be raised permanently in continuously combative environments, like war, although it can also be suddenly lowered by stress.

Because testosterone levels can be measured in saliva as well as in blood, researchers like Alan Booth, Allan Mazur, Richard Udry and particularly James M. Dabbs, whose book ''Heroes, Rogues and Lovers'' will be out this fall, have compiled quite a database on these variations. A certain amount of caution is advisable in interpreting the results of these studies. There is some doubt about the validity of onetime samples to gauge underlying testosterone levels. And most of the studies of the psychological effects of testosterone take place in culturally saturated environments, so that the difference between cause and effect is often extremely hard to disentangle. Nevertheless, the sheer number and scale of the studies, especially in the last decade or so, and the strong behavioral correlations with high testosterone, suggest some conclusions about the social importance of testosterone that are increasingly hard to gainsay.

Testosterone is clearly correlated in both men and women with psychological dominance, confident physicality and high self-esteem. In most combative, competitive environments, especially physical ones, the person with the most T wins. Put any two men in a room together and the one with more testosterone will tend to dominate the interaction. Working women have higher levels of testosterone than women who stay at home, and the daughters of working women have higher levels of testosterone than the daughters of housewives. A 1996 study found that in lesbian couples in which one partner assumes the male, or ''butch,'' role and another assumes the female, or ''femme,'' role, the ''butch'' woman has higher levels of testosterone than the ''femme'' woman. In naval medical tests, midshipmen have been shown to have higher average levels of testosterone than plebes. Actors tend to have more testosterone than ministers, according to a 1990 study. Among 700 male prison inmates in a 1995 study, those with the highest T levels tended to be those most likely to be in trouble with the prison authorities and to engage in unprovoked violence. This is true among women as well as among men, according to a 1997 study of 87 female inmates in a maximum security prison. Although high testosterone levels often correlate with dominance in interpersonal relationships, it does not guarantee more social power. Testosterone levels are higher among blue-collar workers, for example, than among white-collar workers, according to a study of more than 4,000 former military personnel conducted in 1992. A 1998 study found that trial lawyers -- with their habituation to combat, conflict and swagger -- have higher levels of T than other lawyers.

The salient question, of course, is, How much of this difference in aggression and dominance is related to environment? Are trial lawyers naturally more testosteroned, and does that lead them into their profession? Or does the experience of the courtroom raise their levels? Do working women have naturally higher T levels, or does the prestige of work and power elevate their testosterone? Because of the limits of researching such a question, it is hard to tell beyond a reasonable doubt. But the social context clearly matters. It is even possible to tell who has won a tennis match not by watching the game, but by monitoring testosterone-filled saliva samples throughout. Testosterone levels rise for both players before the match. The winner of any single game sees his T production rise; the loser sees it fall. The ultimate winner experiences a postgame testosterone surge, while the loser sees a collapse. This is true even for people watching sports matches. A 1998 study found that fans backing the winning side in a college basketball game and a World Cup soccer match saw their testosterone levels rise; fans rooting for the losing teams in both games saw their own T levels fall. There is, it seems, such a thing as vicarious testosterone.

One theory to explain this sensitivity to environment is that testosterone was originally favored in human evolution to enable success-

ful hunting and combat. It kicks in, like adrenaline, in anticipation of combat, mental or physical, and helps you prevail. But a testosterone crash can be a killer too. Toward the end of my two-week cycle, I can almost feel my spirits dragging. In the event of a just-lost battle, as Matt Ridley points out in his book ''The Red Queen,'' there's a good reason for this to occur. If you lose a contest with prey or a rival, it makes sense not to pick another fight immediately. So your body wisely prompts you to withdraw, filling your brain with depression and self-doubt. But if you have made a successful kill or defeated a treacherous enemy, your hormones goad you into further conquest. And people wonder why professional football players get into postgame sexual escapades and violence. Or why successful businessmen and politicians often push their sexual luck.

Similarly, testosterone levels may respond to more long-term stimuli. Studies have shown that inner-city youths, often exposed to danger in high-crime neighborhoods, may generate higher testosterone levels than unthreatened, secluded suburbanites. And so high T levels may not merely be responses to a violent environment; they may subsequently add to it in what becomes an increasingly violent, sexualized cycle. (It may be no accident that testosterone-soaked ghettos foster both high levels of crime and high levels of illegitimacy.) In the same way, declines in violence and crime may allow T levels to drop among young inner-city males, generating a virtuous trend of further reductions in crime and birth rates. This may help to explain why crime can decline precipitously, rather than drift down slowly, over time. Studies have also shown that men in long-term marriages see their testosterone levels progressively fall and their sex drives subsequently decline. It is as if their wives successfully tame them, reducing their sexual energy to a level where it is more unlikely to seek extramarital outlets. A 1993 study showed that single men tended to have higher levels of testosterone than married men and that men with high levels of testosterone turned out to be more likely to have had a failed marriage. Of course, if you start out with higher T levels, you may be more likely to fail at marriage, stay in the sexual marketplace, see your testosterone increase in response to this and so on.

None of this means, as the scientists always caution, that testosterone is directly linked to romantic failure or violence. No study has found a simple correlation, for example, between testosterone levels and crime. But there may be a complex correlation. The male-prisoner study, for example, found no general above-normal testosterone levels among inmates. But murderers and armed robbers had higher testosterone levels than mere car thieves and burglars. Why is this not surprising? One of the most remarkable, but least commented on, social statistics available is the sex differential in crime. For decades, arrest rates have shown that an overwhelmingly disproportionate number of arrestees are male. Although the sex differential has narrowed since the chivalrous 1930's, when the male-female arrest ratio was 12 to 1, it remains almost 4 to 1, a close echo of the testosterone differential between men and women. In violent crime, men make up an even bigger proportion. In 1998, 89 percent of murders in the United States, for example, were committed by men. Of course, there's a nature-nurture issue here as well, and the fact that the sex differential in crime has decreased over this century suggests that environment has played a part. Yet despite the enormous social changes of the last century, the differential is still 4 to 1, which suggests that underlying attributes may also have a great deal to do with it.

This, then, is what it comes down to: testosterone is a facilitator of risk -- physical, criminal, personal. Without the influence of testosterone, the cost of these risks might seem to far outweigh the benefits. But with testosterone charging through the brain, caution is thrown to the wind. The influence of testosterone may not always lead to raw physical confrontation. In men with many options it may influence the decision to invest money in a dubious enterprise, jump into an ill-advised sexual affair or tell an egregiously big whopper. At the time, all these decisions may make some sort of testosteroned sense. The White House, anyone?

The effects of testosterone are not secret; neither is the fact that men have far more if it than women. But why? As we have seen, testosterone is not synonymous with gender; in some species, it is the female who has most of it. The relatively new science of evolutionary psychology offers perhaps the best explanation for why that's not the case in humans. For neo-Darwinians, the aggressive and sexual aspects of testosterone are related to the division of labor among hunter-gatherers in our ancient but formative evolutionary past. This division -- men in general hunted, women in general gathered -- favored differing levels of testosterone. Women need some testosterone -- for self-defense, occasional risk-taking, strength -- but not as much as men. Men use it to increase their potential to defeat rivals, respond to physical threats in strange environments, maximize their physical attractiveness, prompt them to spread their genes as widely as possible and defend their home if necessary.

But the picture, as most good evolutionary psychologists point out, is more complex than this. Men who are excessively testosteroned are not that attractive to most women. Although they have the genes that turn women on -- strong jaws and pronounced cheekbones, for example, are correlated with high testosterone -- they can also be precisely the unstable, highly sexed creatures that childbearing, stability-seeking women want to avoid. There are two ways, evolutionary psychologists hazard, that women have successfully squared this particular circle. One is to marry the sweet class nerd and have an affair with the college quarterback: that way you get the good genes, the good sex and the stable home. The other is to find a man with variable T levels, who can be both stable and nurturing when you want him to be and yet

become a muscle-bound, bristly gladiator when the need arises. The latter strategy, as Emma Bovary realized, is sadly more easily said than done.

So over millennia, men with high but variable levels of testosterone were the ones most favored by women and therefore most likely to produce offspring, and eventually us. Most men today are highly testosteroned, but not rigidly so. We don't have to live at all times with the T levels required to face down a woolly mammoth or bed half the village's young women. We can adjust so that our testosterone levels make us more suitable for co-parenting or for simply sticking around our mates when the sexual spark has dimmed. Indeed, one researcher, John Wingfield, has found a suggestive correlation in bird species between adjustable testosterone levels and males that have an active role to play in rearing their young. Male birds with consistently high testosterone levels tend to be worse fathers; males with variable levels are better dads. So there's hope for the new man yet.

From the point of view of men, after all, constantly high testosterone is a real problem, as any 15-year-old boy trying to concentrate on his homework will tell you. I missed one deadline on this article because it came three days after a testosterone shot and I couldn't bring myself to sit still long enough. And from a purely genetic point of view, men don't merely have an interest in impregnating as many women as possible; they also have an interest in seeing that their offspring are brought up successfully and their genes perpetuated. So for the male, the conflict between sex and love is resolved, as it is for the female, by a compromise between the short-term thrill of promiscuity and the long-term rewards of nurturing children. Just as the female does, he optimizes his genetic outcome by a stable marriage and occasional extramarital affairs. He is just more likely to have these affairs than a woman. Testosterone is both cause and effect of this difference.

And the difference is a real one. This is so obvious a point that we sometimes miss it. But without that difference, it would be hard to justify separate sports leagues for men and women, just as it would be hard not to suspect judicial bias behind the fact that of the 98 people executed last year in the United States, 100 percent came from a group that composes a little less than 50 percent of the population; that is, men. When the discrepancy is racial, we wring our hands. That it is sexual raises no red flags. Similarly, it is not surprising that 55 percent of everyone arrested in 1998 was under the age of 25 -- the years when male testosterone levels are at their natural peak.

It is also controversial yet undeniable that elevating testosterone levels can be extremely beneficial for physical and mental performance. It depends, of course, on what you're performing in. If your job is to whack home runs, capture criminals or play the market, then testosterone is a huge advantage. If you're a professional conciliator, office manager or teacher, it is probably a handicap. Major League Baseball was embarrassed that Mark McGwire's 1998 season home-run record might have been influenced by his use of androstenedione, a legal supplement that helps increase the body's own production of testosterone. But its own study into andro's effects concluded that regular use of it clearly raises T levels and so improves muscle mass and physical strength, without serious side effects. Testosterone also accelerates the rate of recovery from physical injury. Does this help make sense of McGwire's achievement? More testosterone obviously didn't give him the skill to hit 70 home runs, but it almost certainly contributed to the physical and mental endurance that helped him do so.

Since most men have at least 10 times as much T as most women, it therefore makes sense not to have coed baseball leagues. Equally, it makes sense that women will be underrepresented in a high-testosterone environment like military combat or construction. When the skills required are more cerebral or more endurance-related, the male-female gap may shrink, or even reverse itself. But otherwise, gender inequality in these fields is primarily not a function of sexism, merely of common sense. This is a highly controversial position, but it really shouldn't be. Even more unsettling is the racial gap in testosterone. Several solid studies, published in publications like Journal of the National Cancer Institute, show that black men have on average 3 to 19 percent more testosterone than white men. This is something to consider when we're told that black men dominate certain sports because of white racism or economic class rather than black skill. This reality may, of course, feed stereotypes about blacks being physical but not intellectual. But there's no evidence of any trade-off between the two. To say that someone is physically gifted is to say nothing about his mental abilities, as even N.F.L. die-hards have come to realize. Indeed, as Jon Entine points out in his new book, ''Taboo,'' even the position of quarterback, which requires a deft mix of mental and physical strength and was once predominantly white, has slowly become less white as talent has been rewarded. The percentage of blacks among N.F.L. quarterbacks is now twice the percentage of blacks in the population as a whole.

But fears of natural difference still haunt the debate about gender equality. Many feminists have made tenacious arguments about the lack of any substantive physical or mental differences between men and women as if the political equality of the sexes depended on it. But to rest the equality of women on the physical and psychological equivalence of the sexes is to rest it on sand. In the end, testosterone bites. This year, for

example, Toys ''R'' Us announced it was planning to redesign its toy stores to group products most likely to be bought by the same types of consumers: in marketing jargon, ''logical adjacencies.'' The results? Almost total gender separation. ''Girl's World'' would feature Easy-Bake Ovens and Barbies; ''Boy's World,'' trucks and action figures. Though Toys ''R'' Us denied that there was any agenda behind this -- its market research showed that gender differences start as young as 2 years old -- such a public out-cry ensued that the store canceled its plans. Meanwhile, Fox Family Channels is about to introduce two new, separate cable channels for boys and

girls, boyzChannel and girlzChannel, to attract advertisers and consumers more efficiently. Fox executives told The Wall Street Journal that their move is simply a reflection of what Nielsen-related research tells them about the viewing habits of boys and girls: that, ''in general terms, girls are more interested in entertainment that is relationship-oriented,'' while boys are ''more action-oriented.'' T anyone? After more than two decades of relentless legal, cultural and ideological attempts to negate sexual difference between boys and girls, the market has turned around and shown that very little, after all, has changed.

Advocates of a purely environmental origin for this difference between the sexes counter that gender socialization begins very early and is picked up by subtle inferences from parental interaction and peer pressure, before being reinforced by the collective culture at large. Most parents observing toddlers choosing their own toys and play patterns can best judge for themselves how true this is. But as Matt Ridley has pointed out, there is also physiological evidence of very early mental differences between the sexes, most of it to the advantage of girls. Ninety-five percent of all hyperactive kids are boys; four times as many boys are dyslexic and learning-disabled as girls. There is a greater distinction between the right and left brain among boys than girls, and worse linguistic skills. In general, boys are better at spatial and abstract tasks, girls at communication. These are generalizations, of course. There are many, many boys who are great linguists and model students, and vice versa. Some boys even prefer, when left to their own devices, to play with dolls as well as trucks. But we are talking of generalities here, and the influence of womb-given testosterone on those generalities is undeniable.

Some of that influence is a handicap. We are so used to associating testosterone with strength, masculinity and patriarchal violence that it is easy to ignore that it also makes men weaker in some respects than women. It doesn't correlate with economic power: in fact, as we have seen, blue-collar workers have more of it than white-collar workers. It gets men into trouble. For reasons no one seems to understand, testosterone may also be an immune suppressant. High levels of it can correspond, as recent studies have shown, not only with baldness but also with heart disease and a greater susceptibility to

infectious diseases. Higher levels of prostate cancer among blacks, some researchers believe, may well be related to blacks' higher testosterone levels. The aggression it can foster and the risks it encourages lead men into situations that often wound or kill them. And higher levels of testosterone-driven promiscuity make men more prone to sexually transmitted diseases. This is one reason that men live shorter lives on average than women. There is something, in other words, tragic about testosterone. It can lead to a certain kind of male glory; it may lead to valor or boldness or impulsive romanticism. But it also presages a uniquely male kind of doom. The cockerel with the brightest comb is often the most attractive and the most testosteroned, but it is also the most vulnerable to parasites. It is as if it has sacrificed quantity of life for intensity of experience, and this trade-off is a deeply male one.

So it is perhaps unsurprising that those professions in which this trade-off is most pronounced -- the military, contact sports, hazardous exploration, venture capitalism, politics, gambling -- tend to be disproportionately male. Politics is undoubtedly the most controversial because it is such a critical arena for the dispersal of power. But consider for a moment how politics is conducted in our society. It is saturated with combat, ego, conflict and risk. An entire career can be lost in a single gaffe or an unexpected shift in the national mood. This ego-driven roulette is almost as highly biased toward the testosteroned as wrestling. So it makes some sense that after almost a century of electorates made up by as many women as men, the number of female politicians remains pathetically small in most Western democracies. This may not be endemic to politics; it may have more to do with the way our culture constructs politics. And it is not to say that women are not good at government. Those qualities associated with low testosterone -- patience, risk aversion, empathy -- can all lead to excellent governance. They are just lousy qualities in the crapshoot of electoral politics.

If you care about sexual equality, this is obviously a challenge, but it need not be as depressing as it sounds. The sports world offers one way out. Men and women do not compete directly against one another; they have separate tournaments and leagues. Their different styles of physical excellence can be appreciated in different ways. At some basic level, of course, men will always be better than women in many of these contests. Men run faster and throw harder. Women could compensate for this by injecting testosterone, but if they took enough to be truly competitive, they would become men, which would somewhat defeat the purpose.

The harder cases are in those areas in which physical strength is important but not always crucial, like military combat or manual labor. And here the compromise is more likely to be access but inequality in numbers. Finance? Business? Here, where the testosterone-driven differences may well be more subtly psychological, and where men may dominate by discrimination rather than merit, is the trickiest arena. Testosterone-induced impatience may lead to poor decision-making, but low-testosterone risk aversion may lead to an inability to seize business opportunities. Perhaps it is safest to say that unequal numbers of men and women in these spheres is not prima facie evidence of sexism. We should do everything we can to ensure equal access, but it is foolish to insist that numerical inequality is always a function of bias rather than biology. This doesn't mean we shouldn't worry about individual cases of injustice; just that we shouldn't be shocked if gender inequality endures. And we should recognize that affirmative action for women (and men) in all arenas is an inherently utopian project.

Then there is the medical option. A modest solution might be to give more women access to testosterone to improve their sex drives, aggression and risk affinity and to help redress their disadvantages in those areas as compared with men. This is already done for severely depressed women, or women with hormonal imbalances, or those lacking an adequate sex drive, especially after menopause. Why not for women who simply want to rev up their will to power? Its use needs to be carefully monitored because it can also lead to side effects, like greater susceptibility to cancer, but that's what doctors are there for. And since older men also suffer a slow drop-off in T levels, there's no reason they should be cold-shouldered either. If the natural disadvantages of gender should be countered, why not the natural disadvantages of age? In some ways, this is already happening. Among the most common drugs now available through Internet doctors and pharmacies, along with Viagra and Prozac, is testosterone. This summer, with the arrival of AndroGel, the testosterone gel created as a medical treatment for those four to five million men who suffer from low levels of testosterone, recreational demand may soar.

Or try this thought experiment: what if parents committed to

gender equity opted to counteract the effect of testosterone on boys in the womb by complementing it with injections of artificial female hormones? That way, structural gender difference could be eradicated from the beginning. Such a policy would lead to ''men and women with normal bodies but identical feminine brains,'' Matt Ridley posits. ''War, rape, boxing, car racing, pornography and hamburgers and beer would soon be distant memories. A feminist paradise would have arrived.'' Today's conservative cultural critics might also be enraptured. Promiscuity would doubtless decline, fatherhood improve, crime drop, virtue spread. Even gay men might start behaving like lesbians, fleeing the gym and marrying for life. This is a fantasy, of course, but our increasing control and understanding of the scientific origins of our behavior, even of our culture, is fast making those fantasies things we will have to actively choose to forgo.

But fantasies also tell us something. After a feminist century, we may be in need of a new understanding of masculinity. The concepts of manliness, of gentlemanly behavior, of chivalry have been debunked. The New Age bonding of the men's movement has been outlived. What our increasing knowledge of testosterone suggests is a core understanding of what it is to be a man, for better and worse. It is about the ability to risk for good and bad; to act, to strut, to dare, to seize. It is about a kind of energy we often rue but would surely miss. It is about the foolishness that can lead to courage or destruction, the beauty that can be strength or vanity. To imagine a world without it is to see more clearly how our world is inseparable from it and how our current political pieties are too easily threatened by its reality.

And as our economy becomes less physical and more cerebral, as women slowly supplant men in many industries, as income inequalities grow and more highly testosteroned blue-collar men find themselves shunted to one side, we will have to find new ways of channeling what nature has bequeathed us. I don't think it's an accident that in the last decade there has been a growing focus on a muscular male physique in our popular culture, a boom in crass men's magazines, an explosion in violent computer games or a professional wrestler who has become governor. These are indications of a cultural displacement, of a world in which the power of testosterone is ignored or attacked, with the result that it re-emerges in cruder and less social forms. Our main task in the gender wars of the new century may not be how to bring women fully into our society, but how to keep men from seceding from it, how to reroute testosterone for constructive ends, rather than ignore it for political point-making.

For my part, I'll keep injecting the Big T. Apart from how great it makes me feel, I consider it no insult to anyone else's gender to celebrate the uniqueness of one's own. Diversity need not mean the equalization of difference. In fact, true diversity requires the acceptance of difference. A world without the unruly, vulnerable, pioneering force of testosterone would be a fairer and calmer, but far grayer and duller, place. It is certainly somewhere I would never want to live. Perhaps the fact that I write this two days after the injection of another 200 milligrams of testosterone into my bloodstream makes me more likely to settle for this colorful trade-off than others. But it seems to me no disrespect to womanhood to say that I am perfectly happy to be a man, to feel things no woman will ever feel to the degree that I feel them, to experience the world in a way no woman ever has. And to do so without apology or shame.

	New Chief of F.D.A. Advocates Quicker Approval Process for Brand-Name and Generic Drugs


The new head of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Mark B. McClellan, said today that he intended to speed the approval of new drugs and crack down on deceptive pharmaceutical advertising.

The agency has substantially reduced the time required to review and approve new medicines since 1993, when drug companies began paying fees to help cover the costs of such reviews. It still takes a little more than a year for the agency to approve a typical brand-name drug, and Dr. McClellan said today, ''We can do better.''

Dr. McClellan said he wanted to accelerate the approval of both brand-name and generic drugs, as well as medical devices.

''We have some great opportunities to do better in drug approval times and in getting products that are safe and effective to market more quickly,'' Dr. McClellan, a physician and economist who worked at the White House until he took charge of the agency on Nov. 14, said.

User fees paid by drug companies accounted for about half the $332 million that the agency spent on drug reviews in the last year.

Told of Dr. McClellan's commitment to speed the review of low-cost generic versions of brand-name drugs, Jake Hansen, vice president of Barr Laboratories, a large maker of generic drugs, said, ''That's music to our ears.''

Currently, Mr. Hansen said, ''the decision on approval of a generic drug is supposed to be made within six months after an application is filed, but it's not at all unusual for the process to take 14 to 16 months, which is longer than the time needed to approve many brand-name drugs.''

Some consumer groups assert that quicker review of new drugs has increased the risk that products will later be found unsafe and removed from the market. Some studies have found such an increase, but the agency disagrees.

Dr. McClellan said his agency would be more aggressive in policing claims made in television advertisements for prescription drugs.

''We will not be afraid to go to court when necessary'' to stop companies from exaggerating the benefits or understating the risks of drugs, he said.

Since 1997, the agency has sent more than 88 letters to drug companies objecting to their advertisements on television and radio and in print.

The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, reported last week that several major companies had repeatedly disseminated misleading advertisements for the same drug even after being cited for violations.

Dr. McClellan said he would try to deter violations by setting clearer standards.

''If we see patterns of recurrent use of misleading techniques in advertising,'' he added, ''we will go further than warning letters.''

The commissioner said he was even more concerned about misleading claims for the health benefits of some dietary supplements. ''I am looking for ways to improve our enforcement'' in that area, he said.

Dr. McClellan also said that with the rapid growth in drug development, ''there's a real problem'' getting enough people to participate in clinical trials of new medications. New technology, he said, may allow researchers to predict a drug's side effects at an earlier stage, alerting the government and industry to potential problems, like liver damage, without waiting for the results of lengthy clinical trials with large numbers of patients.

In addition, Dr. McClellan said he wanted to negotiate arrangements with some hospitals and nursing homes so they would automatically and promptly report the adverse effects of drugs and medical devices already on the market.

Dr. Raymond Woosley, a pharmacologist who is vice president of the University of Arizona, called such surveillance an excellent idea.

''It would indicate what proportion of patients exposed to a drug suffer adverse effects,'' Dr. Woosley said, ''and we could use that information to measure the relative safety of different drugs.

The government receives vast amounts of information about the adverse effects of drugs on the market. But the reporting by doctors and patients is generally voluntary, and the government usually has no idea how many people have been exposed to a particular drug.

Dr. McClellan said he did not intend to weigh the costs and benefits of new drugs submitted to his agency for approval.

''That's not part of our mandate,'' he said. ''But I would like to do some additional cost-benefit analysis of our drug approval process. If there are different ways of assuring that a safe, effective drug gets to market, we ought to follow the approach that does it as efficiently as possible, at the least cost to the agency and the drug producers.''

	In Quest to Cure Rare Diseases, Some Get Left Out


If there was a defining moment, a single event that foretold the sadness to come, Eric Godek's parents do not mention it. Looking back, they say only that he was 4 months old when they began to notice things that worried them. He seemed to have lost the ability to lift his head and reach for his toys, and he had begun to choke on feedings.

At first, their pediatrician in Peoria reassured them that Eric, a bright, lively baby with huge brown eyes, seemed healthy. Jessica and David Godek, new parents in their 20's, were eager to believe him.

''But I think in my heart I knew something was wrong,'' Mrs. Godek said.

On Aug. 10, just after Eric turned 5 months old, the Godeks learned that he was suffering from a rare muscle disorder, Pompe disease, and that he had just two or three months left to live.

Desperate to save him, they found one speck of hope: researchers at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., were testing a highly promising experimental treatment in which infants like Eric were given an essential enzyme that they lacked. The Godeks contacted the university, and were encouraged to send Eric's medical records. He had exactly the form of the disease being studied.

But soon after the hope was offered, it was taken away. They were told that although the research team wanted to treat their son, it would not be possible, because the study was designed to include only three babies, and the company sponsoring the research, Synpac Inc., of the nearby Research Triangle Park, had provided enough medicine for only three. There was not enough for a fourth baby, even though the first three had been promised a lifetime supply if the drug worked. And Eric Godek would have been the fourth.

Pompe (pronounced pom-PAY) is an ''orphan'' disease, one of about 5,000 disorders so uncommon that drug companies used to ignore them, assuming there would be too few customers to make it pay to develop treatments. Many of the disorders are severe or fatal, and in 1983, hoping to encourage research, the government began offering tax credits, research grants and other incentives to companies working to treat rare diseases.

The incentives, provided under the Orphan Drug Act, worked. In the decade before it was passed, fewer than 10 orphan drugs came to market; since the act, 193 have been approved, nearly half of them in the last five years. In large part because of the government incentives, several so-called orphan drugs now make their manufacturers more than $1 billion a year.

''The act has been one of the most successful laws ever passed by Congress,'' said Dr. Marlene Haffner, director of the office of orphan products development at the Food and Drug Administration. ''It's just been gangbusters.''

But in the tide of investment capital, start-up companies, new drug applications, competition for marketing rights and confidential business deals, it is possible for a child to be lost. Companies competing to be first to market an orphan drug need to move quickly, and they have no more incentive than any other drug company to spend the time or money to enlarge a study. Mr. and Mrs. Godek found that a drug development strategy meant to benefit patients like their son had no provision to help him in a crisis. It rewarded manufacturers for creating new drugs, but not for making experimental treatments available to sick people with no other options.

Eric Godek died on Sept. 28, and his parents were left with piercing questions about whether his death might have been avoided.

A Big-Money Industry Built on Exclusivity

About 20 million Americans have orphan diseases: rare disorders, each one affecting fewer than 200,000 people. They include familiar illnesses like sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis, but also many others like Pompe disease that few have heard of.

Most of the work on orphan drugs is done by small-  to medium-sized biotechnology companies created to develop new products. Some have been started by researchers who struck out on their own, backed by investors, to commercialize discoveries made in university laboratories.

Under the Orphan Drug Act, these companies can get waivers of F.D.A. filing fees, worth $300,000 per drug, in addition to grants and tax credits. Especially important, a company that is first to receive F.D.A. approval for a particular orphan drug also gets exclusive marketing rights to it for seven years. Companies then set their own prices; even though money from taxpayers may have supported the development of an orphan drug, the F.D.A. does not regulate the pricing of the final products.

Many orphan drugs cannot be patented, Dr. Haffner said, either because they are natural substances or because they are old products whose original patents have run out by the time a new use is found for them. ''That's why exclusivity has been so important,'' she said. ''It is stronger than a patent, because F.D.A. will monitor it.'' In the case of new drugs that can be patented, the exclusive rights can come into effect before a patent does.

Abbey Meyers, president of the National Organization for Rare Disorders, in New Fairfield, Conn., said, ''The biotechnology industry was built on the Orphan Drug Act. These companies realize that if they make drugs for diabetes and high blood pressure, they can take a tiny piece of a big market with a lot of competition. But if they go into a rare disease, there's no competition. They can charge anything they want.''

As a result, orphan drugs are among the biotechnology industry's biggest moneymakers. One, a replacement enzyme, like the treatment being studied for Pompe disease, costs $170,000 to $340,000 a year per patient.

Fingers Are Pointed As a Child Dies

Pompe disease, also known as acid maltase deficiency, is caused by a deficiency in an enzyme called acid alpha glucosidase. Normally, the enzyme helps the body break down glycogen, a complex carbohydrate that is converted to glucose for energy. Without the enzyme, glycogen builds up in the heart and other muscles, causing extensive damage.

The disorder is caused by a genetic defect inherited from both parents, and most, like the Godeks, have no idea they are carriers of a lethal gene until they find they have given birth to a seriously ill child.

There are several forms of Pompe disease, varying in severity, and researchers estimate that there are 3,000 to 6,000 cases at any given time in the United States. The type that Eric Godek had is rapidly fatal, because it damages the heart and the muscles needed for breathing. But the brain is spared, and babies remain as bright and aware as ever while they weaken and become immobile.

In May, Duke University Medical Center announced that it would begin a clinical trial to test an experimental treatment in three babies with the most severe form of Pompe disease. The treatment, injections of the missing enzyme, had been developed by Dr. Yuan-Tsong Chen, a professor of pediatrics and genetics and chief of medical genetics. Babies in the study would live at the hospital with a parent for three months.

The trial was paid for by Synpac Inc., the drug development company in Research Triangle Park, with a parent company in Britain and owners in Taiwan. The university had licensed Dr. Chen's technology to Synpac. A spokesman for Synpac said it had invested millions in the research, and had contracted the actual manufacturing to still another company, which the spokesman declined to name.

Duke and Synpac have competition: a Dutch company, Pharming Group N.V., is also testing a replacement enzyme in the Netherlands, and hoping for F.D.A. approval. Its partner in the research is Genzyme, of Cambridge, Mass.

Much is at stake: whichever company can be the first to prove its treatment works and get F.D.A. approval will also win the seven years of exclusive marketing rights.

The Godeks knew there was no guarantee that the treatment would work. But they also knew that the first infant in the Duke study was still alive, past the time when the disease would normally have taken his life. To them, the study was Eric's only chance. Two babies had already been chosen, but they were told that Eric might qualify for the third spot. Another child, though, was also being evaluated.

They were devastated to learn that Eric would not be part of the study after all. The other baby had qualified first. Even though Eric had the rapidly fatal form of Pompe disease being studied, even though he was the only additional qualified applicant, the Godeks were told that there was not enough medicine or enough staff to take care of him.

To the Godeks, that defied logic. If enough enzyme could be made to treat three children for life, how could it not be possible to make enough to keep a fourth alive? ''I think they're in competition to get the patent and they don't want to let anything slow them down,'' Mrs. Godek said, shortly before her son died.  ''The drug company and the investors are making a business decision.''

In telephone interviews before Eric's death, Dr. Chen and an official at Synpac declined to address those questions. They would not explain how long it took to produce the enzyme, or say whether enough could be made in time to treat him. Initially, Dr. Chen said Synpac had declared that the baby could not be treated, but Synpac officials said Dr. Chen had decided. Finally, both Synpac and Dr. Chen blamed a third party, the company manufacturing the drug, which they declined to name.

But Dr. Chen said that if the drug were available, he would want to treat Eric. ''Other than the parents, I am probably the one most desperate to help these babies.''

By late September, the Godek family had appealed to Synpac, the orphan drug office at the F.D.A. and even their United States senator, Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, who called Synpac on their behalf, to no avail.

Dr. Haffner said the orphan drug office was also powerless to help. The F.D.A. can let patients have unapproved drugs for ''compassionate use,'' she said, but cannot help if the drug is not available. If the problem had been money, she said, Synpac could have asked the F.D.A. for a grant.

Ms. Meyers, of the rare disease organization, said: ''Biotechnology companies, being small and not as wealthy, don't have the money to invest in manufacturing a huge amount of a drug before they know whether the F.D.A. is going to approve it or not. If it costs $50 million to make it and the F.D.A. doesn't approve it, they'll go bankrupt. They hold back until they get approval.''

She said that in several cases, even when new orphan drugs were approved and marketed, companies could not meet the demand for them. For example, she said, new treatments for multiple sclerosis and Lou Gehrig's disease were initially in such short supply that patients had to enter their names into lotteries to obtain the drugs.

''American patients are not used to rationing,'' she said. ''The rest of the world is. I think people in the United States are going to have to get used to it. It's going to happen more and more.''

Time ran out on the morning of Sept. 28 when, after a night of struggling to breathe, Eric Godek died at a hospital in Peoria.

Later that day, Mr. Godek said that he and his wife would always wonder whether their son's death might have been avoided. ''I'm trying not to be bitter,'' Mrs. Godek said. ''But something has to be done so this doesn't happen again and again and again.''

Finding Martian Molecules

The two Viking landers that reached Mars in 1976 carried instruments for analyzing the planet's soil for the presence of organic molecules. For their time, these shoe box-size biochemistry laboratories were marvels of miniaturization and engineering. But they didn't resolve the issue of whether there is or was life on Mars.

In retrospect, they may not have been sensitive enough. The instruments didn't find any significant organic molecules, but given what else was discovered about Mars on those missions, that was hardly surprising. The Martian surface was found to be so reactive that most organic molecules that did exist would be rapidly destroyed. So only instruments with much greater sensitivity than those on the landers would be able to detect the extremely small concentrations of molecules that might remain.

Now, Dr. Richard A. Mathies of the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues have built such an instrument, designed to detect amino acids. Called the Mars Organic Analyzer and described in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, it uses a technique called capillary electrophoresis to separate the molecules and laser-stimulated fluorescence to detect them. It accomplishes all this with microfluidic technology: most of the work is done on a tiny wafer filled with microscopic channels, valves and pumps.

The analyzer was tested on soil from the Atacama Desert in Chile, an extremely dry region that is considered among the most Mars-like places on Earth, and in the Panoche Valley in central California, which has a lot of jarosite, a mineral also found on Mars (and a sign that water once existed there).

In the Chilean samples, amino acids were detected at concentrations as low as 10 parts per billion, while the concentrations in the California samples were even lower -- as low as 70 parts per trillion. The researchers hope to build an analyzer that will be carried aboard the European Space Agency's ExoMars mission, to be launched in 2009.

Giving an Ice Sheet an Age

While the organic analyzer is designed to detect something far away, Dr. Greg Balco of the University of Washington and colleagues have been working to detect something far back in time. Using land-based data, they have determined the age of the first North American glacial maximum -- the first time the Laurentide ice sheet spread down from the north. To date recent glacial maximums, scientists measure the carbon 14 isotope in the rocks that the glaciers deposit at their southernmost extensions before they retreat. But carbon 14 dating doesn't work for very old rocks, so older maximums have been less precisely dated, using marine sediments that just give an idea of the changes in ice volume.

Dr. Balco and his team used a different technique, analyzing rocks in central Missouri for radioactive isotopes of aluminum and beryllium. These are produced by exposure of quartz to cosmic rays when the quartz is on the surface. The production stops when the rock is buried and the isotope decays, enabling scientists to calculate the age of the burial.

The Missouri quartz was buried by all the material dumped by the glacier at the extent of its range. So the date of the burial -- about 2.4 million years ago, the researchers report in the journal Science -- corresponds to the date of the glacial maximum. The researchers say this is the first, and nearly the most southerly, advance of the Laurentide sheet.

A Clogged Passageway

Ice of a different sort has been wreaking havoc in Antarctica. A 100-mile-long iceberg, B15-A, part of an even bigger iceberg that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf five years ago, has drifted into a position where it is affecting wind and water currents in the Ross Sea. As a result, there is more ice than usual in the sea this time of year, creating more headaches for ships supplying the American base at McMurdo Station.

The difficulties may end soon, however, as the berg is drifting toward a glacier, the Drygalski Ice Tongue. A collision, which could happen any day, may break the iceberg and help open the area.

Homing Pigeons, Close to Home

Homing pigeons are renowned for their ability to navigate over long distances, and after decades of study scientists are pretty sure they know how the birds do it. They use their sense of smell to figure out where they are and the position of the sun to determine the direction they must fly.

But less is known about how pigeons navigate when they are close to home, in more familiar surroundings. Many researchers have thought that in such situations the birds must rely, at least partly, on visual cues.

''There's been controversy about whether familiar landmarks have been used,'' said Jessica Meade, a doctoral student in the Animal Behavior Research Group at the University of Oxford in England. ''Because there was no tracking of the birds along the homeward route, the hypotheses aren't very clear.''

Ms. Meade and two colleagues, Dr. Dora Biro and Dr. Tim Guilford, set out to rectify that situation, using small Global Positioning System loggers attached to the backs of 15 homing pigeons. These devices, which weigh about an ounce, use satellite signals to record precise location fixes every second.

The researchers released the birds about three miles from home, and each bird had about 20 flights from the same point. The results are published in Proceedings B, a journal of the Royal Society.

At first, the researchers found, the birds' routes were highly variable. But after a number of flights the birds began to follow the same path from flight to flight, even though they were not necessarily the most direct routes home.

This route stereotypy, as it is called, implies that the birds use visual cues to navigate: they follow the same cues in order to reduce the memory load on their brains.

''We were also surprised that the routes were longer than they needed to be,'' Ms. Meade said. This implies that the pigeons use a chain of landmarks by themselves or in combination with compass bearings, but that they do not integrate direction and distance. If they did, Ms. Meade said, they would realize their routes are not the most efficient ones.

Whatever the precise method, the work suggests that homing pigeons shift from primarily compass navigation to visual navigation when they get near their home.

''It seems like they use a different strategy when they are very familiar with a task,'' Ms. Meade said.

	Directionless? Scientists Offer Some Clues


So I'm walking down Lexington Avenue in Manhattan on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon, and I stop to admire a church that I'd never really noticed before: St. Jean Baptiste, on the corner of 76th Street.

I like its noble neo-classical fussiness, its four foliated white marble pillars and two towers stacked with arches, columns, crowns. I dart inside for a look, gaze up at the painted dome, breathe in the rich, churchy air, and go back out to continue my walk downtown.

It's warm, I'm thirsty, so after about 10 blocks I cross Lexington Avenue to buy a bottle of juice from a grocery. I drink the juice as I stroll along, and soon I stop to admire another lovely church. Four white marble pillars, dome, double towers.

How can it be, I ask myself, that there are two such similar and ornate churches on Lexington Avenue, and that I, a lover of architecture and longtime New Yorker, hadn't realized it? I run up to the entrance to explore this second interior, but stop short in horror when I read the sign: St. Jean Baptiste. Holy deja vu all over again! With considerable self-disgust, I reconstruct what happened. The simple act of crossing Lexington Avenue for refreshments had completely flipped around my sense of left, right, north and south, with the result that, after leaving the grocery, I had mindlessly retraced my steps back uptown.

Some women are attracted to the wrong men; I'm attracted to the wrong direction. I get lost driving, I get lost walking, I get lost in the great outdoors, I get lost in corridors.  A boyfriend once observed that my internal compass was so dysfunctional as to be almost useful: watch which way Natalie turns, and then head in the opposite direction.

I've found some comfort in the fact that many others suffer from my little handicap. Not for nothing have ''global positioning systems'' become one of the most popular frills in automobiles. The mere mention of ''poor sense of direction'' in an Ann Landers column invariably unleashes a floodtide of reader confessionals, tragicomic tales of getting lost on the way to weddings, funerals, the delivery room.

More heartening still is the keen interest that scientists have lately taken in the subject of how humans and other species navigate -- or fail to. The study of what they call spatial cognition, or way-finding, is attracting a growing cadre of researchers from all sectors of the academic map, including psychology, neuroscience, computer science, zoology, anthropology, linguistics and geography.

''I've been in this business long enough to see my specialty go in and out of style, and back in again,'' said Dr. Gary L. Allen, a psychology professor at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. ''Right now, spatial cognition studies are extremely popular, and they're more interdisciplinary than ever.''

Some scientists are delving into the talents of the world's great wanderers: birds, turtles, caribou and other creatures that travel thousands upon thousands of miles a year without once forgetting where they parked the car. Other researchers are zeroing in on the specific parts of the brain that allow travelers to use spatial layout or visible landmarks to guide their paths -- the mind's placemakers, if you will. It turns out that the brain is a compulsive categorizer and pigeonholer, in orienting itself topographically as much as in sizing up new acquaintances or judging ethnic groups.

In a review that will appear in September in the British journal Brain, Dr. Geoffrey Aguirre, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania, describes a group of patients who, as a result of stroke or brain injury, suffer from an unusual and eerily specific type of topographic disorientation. He calls it ''landmark agnosia'' -- an inability to recognize big, stable objects in the environment, particularly buildings. Such patients can describe where it is they need to go, but when they are outside, they cannot use the most salient landmarks -- a neighbor's yellow house, the local supermarket -- to anchor and direct them.

''They'll turn a corner,'' Dr. Aguirre said in an interview, ''and the street will be completely unfamiliar to them.''

Over time, the patients learn to compensate for their discrete deficit. ''They pay attention to minor details in the environment that most of us are unaware of,'' Dr. Aguirre said. ''They may notice a particular doorknob on a building they've passed, or the number of slats in a park bench. By focusing on these tiny features, they manage to string together a path.''

The patients were known to have lesions in an area of the lower back portion of brain called the lingual gyrus. ''The general model for this area of the brain is that it has a number of specialized modules for recognizing different objects,'' Dr. Aguirre said. ''So you can have agnosias where you can't recognize faces, or farmers with damage here may have a sheep or cow agnosia.''

Through neuro-imaging studies of normal people, Dr. Aguirre has found that when subjects are presented with a series of pictures, the right lingual gyrus fires most avidly in response to images of buildings, and barely at all when viewing pictures of faces, tools or cars.

Researchers are also studying the psychology of human way-finding, the often illogical reasons why people decide to take Route A to get to their destination, rather than Routes B or C.

''A lot of operations research and other math models have assumed that people want to take the shortest path to where they are going, and that the particular route they choose, and the sequence of turns they make, will be tied in with the principle of minimizing time and distance,'' said Dr. Reginald Golledge, a professor of geography at the University of California at Santa Barbara. ''Well, an increasing amount of research shows that people don't act like that.''

Instead, people make their way-finding choices based on what ''feels'' right. For example, people like to head off in the direction of their destination. If their endpoint is east, they hate to start by going west, even when an initial jog westward may deliver them to a more efficient route.

Another preferred strategy is called ''longest leg first.'' When conceptualizing a route, Dr. Golledge said, ''people try to start off going the longest and straightest distance possible before making the first turn.''

Choices can also be idiosyncratic. Many drivers seek out roads with the fewest stop signs and traffic lights, no matter how circuitous the route. Drivers like me will always take the most familiar course, and if that road is closed off, will go home and call a taxi.

Nobody knows yet why people make the navigational choices they do. Nor do they know why some people never get lost, while others always need to get found.

One creature that never goes astray is the bobolink, a member of the blackbird family that carries out the longest migratory journey of any songbird in the world. Bobolinks breed as far north as upper New York State and Canada, and then migrate as far south as the southern pampas of Argentina.

''These birds travel 10,000 miles a year,'' said Dr. Robert C. Beason, a professor of biology at the State University of New York in Geneseo. ''But I catch banded birds year after year in the same location.''

Equally impressive is the honeybee, which navigates chiefly and almost unerringly by the sun. It does this by its detailed grasp of the so-called solar ephemeris, the geographic position of sun as a function of time of day. After just a few hours of flying around in the sunshine, a bee has mastered the local solar arc. It then maps that geographic information onto its surroundings, a transfer that allows it to find its way around even on a cloudy day, and to tell its comrades, by waggling and dancing, how to locate a sweet patch of flowers.

Yet good as the great migrators may be, it turns out that they are not very different from people. ''The most interesting thing about animal navigation is that it appears to be done in ways similar to the principles taught in marine navigation classes,'' said Randy Gallistel, a professor of psychology at the University of California at Los Angeles.

There are two fundamental ways of navigating, he explained. One is called path integration, which most people know of as dead reckoning, a corruption of the term ''ded. reckoning,'' for deduced reckoning. In this method, you estimate your direction and speed, and use that to calculate how far you have gone. ''If you keep a scrupulous account of what direction you're going in, you can keep adding it up as you go, so you're reckoning, or calculating, your position in this way,'' Dr. Gallistel said. ''This method of of navigating doesn't require anything out there you recognize, which is why you can use it in the open ocean.''

The other method of navigation is piloting, relying on landmarks or maps of known objects to locate yourself in space.

How a given traveler reckons its course, or which landmarks it pilots by, varies from species to species and moment to moment. Animals can navigate by the position of the sun and stars, by the polarization of light, by smell, by echo-location. Some can use the earth's magnetic fields to direct them, and others attend to currents in the air or water. Researchers have learned that the key to migrational brilliance is versatility, the power to exploit different environmental cues depending on which is the richest in directional information at any given moment.

Homing pigeons, for example, have the capacity to detect the earth's magnetic field and respond to it, through specialized receptors in the front of their brains, between their eyes and nasal organs. But in regions that are magnetically flat, Dr. Beason said, the pigeons pay greater heed to the sun, or to chemical cues, to get home.

''It's very hard to disrupt them,'' Dr. Gallistel said. ''Even if you put Ping-Pong balls over their eyes, they get home again.'' Some evidence suggests that pigeons can be disrupted on their course by extreme magnetic storms, disturbances in the atmosphere caused by solar flares.

Hobbyists race homing pigeons across North America, Dr. Beason said, and those years when there is a poor return rate of the birds are correlated with strong magnetic storms. Alternatively, the birds may have found a more appealing park or gutter en route. ''The pigeons you see on the street,'' Dr. Beason said, ''are homing pigeons that didn't make it back home.''

But not all animals are so savvy. Rodents, for example, can be surprisingly limited in their ability to way-find. Through a famous series of experiments, Dr. Gallistel and his colleagues discovered that rodents, when introduced into a box and presented with a food reward in one corner, use the shape of the box, and only the shape, to relocate the cache later. If the wall near the food is painted a different color than the other three, or similar visual cues are provided, the rodent ignores them and depends on geometry alone.

Recently, Dr. Elizabeth Spelke, a professor of cognitive science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and her colleague Dr. Linda Hermer-Vasquez, discovered that toddlers are like rats: they, too, use the shape of the environment to find their way and disregard distinctive surface features. The researchers studied children 18 months to 2 years old, placing them in a rectangular room with three white walls and one a striking shade of blue or red. They showed the toddlers a toy hidden in one corner, near the colorful wall. Covering the children's eyes and slowly turning them around a couple of times to disorient them, the researchers then told the toddlers to look for the toy. The toddlers ignored the brightness of the wall where the toy was hidden, and used their sense of the room's shape in their searching strategies.

By the time children reach the age of 5 or 6, though, Dr. Spelke said, they are quite capable of using color and other landmarks to find their way. ''This is also the time when we see them start to use spatial language to describe the environment, saying things like 'It's near the blue wall,' or, 'It's on the left.' ''

Dr. Spelke proposes that people's ability to use landmarks in way-finding is intimately correlated with language skills. She and Dr. Hermer-Vasquez experimented with adults, asking them to relocate an object that had been hidden in a room, all the while subjecting the adults to verbal interference tasks known to occupy the brain's language processor. ''We turned the adults back into toddlers,'' Dr. Spelke said. ''They continued to be sensitive to the shape of the environment but were no longer using visual landmarks to reorient themselves.''

With language skills, we have become superlative way-finders of another sort, able to draw maps and atlases, lay out cities with a grid pattern and numbered buildings, design subway lines, invent chronometers and radar, and, most important, stop and ask for directions.

	Equality Between the Sexes: Neanderthal Women Joined Men in the Hunt


A new explanation for the demise of the Neanderthals, the stockily built human species that occupied Europe until the arrival of modern humans 45,000 years ago, has been proposed by two anthropologists at the University of Arizona.

Unlike modern humans, who had developed a versatile division of labor between men and women, the entire Neanderthal population seems to have been engaged in a single main occupation, the hunting of large game, the scientists, Steven L. Kuhn and Mary C. Stiner, say in an article posted online yesterday in Current Anthropology.

Because modern humans exploited the environment more efficiently, by having men hunt large game and women gather small game and plant foods, their populations would have outgrown those of the Neanderthals.

The Neanderthals endured for about 100,000 years, despite a punishing way of life. They preyed on the large animals that flourished in Europe in the ice age like bison, deer, gazelles and wild horses. But there is no evidence that they knew of bows and arrows. Instead, they used stone-tipped spears.

Hunting large game at close range is perilous, and Neanderthal skeletons bear copious fractures. Dr. Kuhn and Dr. Stiner argue that Neanderthal women and children took part in the dangerous hunts, probably as beaters and blockers of exit routes.

Their argument, necessarily indirect, begins with the human hunter-gatherer societies, almost all of which have a division of labor between the sexes.

At sites occupied by modern humans from 45,000 to 10,000 years ago, a period known as the Upper Paleolithic, there is good evidence of different occupations, from small animal and bird remains, as well as the bone awls and needles used to make clothes. It seems reasonable to assume that these activities were divided between men and women, as is the case with modern foraging peoples.

But Neanderthal sites include no bone needles, no small animal remains and no grinding stones for preparing plant foods. So what did Neanderthal women do all day?

Their skeletons are so robustly built that it seems improbable that they just sat at home looking after the children, the anthropologists write. More likely, they did the same as the men, with the whole population engaged in bringing down large game.

The meat of large animals yields a rich payoff, but even the best hunters have unlucky days. The modern humans of the Upper Paleolithic, with their division of labor and diversified food sources, would have been better able to secure a continuous food supply. Nor were they putting their reproductive core -- women and children -- at great risk.

David Pilbeam, a paleoanthropologist at Harvard, said the Arizona researchers' article was ''very stimulating and thoughtful'' and seemed to be the first to propose a mechanism for why Neanderthal populations declined.

Dr. Stiner said the division of labor between the sexes was likely to have arisen in a tropical environment. Indeed, it may have provided the demographic impetus for modern humans to expand out of Africa, she said.

A rival hypothesis proposed by Richard Klein of Stanford University holds that some cognitive advance like the perfection of language underlay the burst of innovative behavior shown by Upper Paleolithic people and their predecessors in Africa.

Why did the Neanderthals fail to adapt when modern humans arrived on their doorstep? Under Dr. Klein's hypothesis, the reason is simply that they were cognitively less advanced.

Dr. Stiner said that in her view there was not time for them to change their culture. ''Although there may have been differences in neurological wiring,'' she said, ''I think another very important key is the legacy of cultural institutions about social roles.'' Is there a genetic basis to the division of labor that emerged in the modern human lineage? ''It's equally compelling to argue that most or all of this has a cultural basis,'' Dr. Stiner said. ''That's where it's very difficult for people like us and Richard Klein to resolve the basis of our disagreement.''

	SCIENTIST AT WORK: Randall White; Falling in Love With France and Its Troves of Ancient History


A few miles upstream from this red-roofed village in the Périgord region of southern France, the meandering Vézère River flows past the entrance to the Gorge of Hell. A trail runs along the base of a limestone cliff to a locked steel door. Behind the door, which can be opened to a visitor only by appointment, is the oldest depiction of a fish ever discovered.

About 25,000 years ago, a prehistoric artist carved the yardlong, bas-relief sculpture into the yellowish ceiling of a shallow rock shelter known today as the Abri du Poisson. The image is so vivid and detailed that experts have been able to make out its species, Salmo salar, the Atlantic salmon.

The fish is framed by a rectangular pattern of deep, closely spaced holes, which, according to Périgord lore and guidebooks on sale at the National Museum of Prehistory in Les Eyzies, are the remnants of an abortive attempt by a Swiss archaeologist to remove this precious artwork and sell it to Berlin's prehistory museum.

Conventional accounts of the episode, which dates to 1912, maintain that this treachery was stopped just in time by the valiant efforts of French prehistorians led by Denis Peyrony, a local schoolteacher who founded the Les Eyzies museum and conducted some of the Périgord's most important archaeological digs.

On a crisp evening in March, however, the archaeologist Randall White of New York University stood at the lectern of the museum's 126-seat auditorium and told the capacity crowd a very different story. The Swiss archaeologist, Otto Hauser, was innocent, Dr. White argued, the victim of an ugly press campaign that included vicious anti-Semitic and anti-German slurs, even though Hauser was neither Jewish nor German.

As Dr. White maintains in his new book in French on the scandal, ''L'Affaire de L'Abri du Poisson,'' the attempted abduction of the fish was carried out entirely by local French citizens, including the owner of the surrounding land.

As for Peyrony, Dr. White concluded that he was not such a steadfast champion of France's cultural heritage after all. In the midst of the Hauser affair, Peyrony, who died in 1954, sold 1,200 prehistoric artifacts from his Périgord excavations to the American Museum of Natural History in New York for a sum equal to about twice his annual schoolteacher's salary.

Dr. White's book on the affair, which is based on five years of research in French, German and American archives, is the culmination of more than three decades of archaeological work in France, during which he has become one of the world's leading experts on the cave paintings, sculptures, carved figurines, and necklaces and other personal ornaments that prehistoric humans produced here by the thousands.

''He has done a huge amount to clarify the unique and unprecedented nature of Cro-Magnon behavioral expression,'' says Ian Tattersall, anthropology curator for the Museum of Natural History. ''His research has allowed us to understand what a break with the past it truly represented.''

Currently, Dr. White is director of an international team excavating at the 35,000-year-old site of Abri Castanet in the Vézère Valley, which was first investigated by Peyrony and has provided some of the earliest evidence for the dispersal of Homo sapiens from Africa to Western Europe.

Peyrony found hundreds of personal ornaments and dozens of paintings and engravings at Abri Castanet. Dr. White's new excavations, financed by the National Science Foundation, are intended to address several unanswered questions about these first migrations of modern humans, including how and why they replaced the Neanderthals who had lived in the area for tens of thousands of years.

Meanwhile, Dr. White himself has become an ardent defender of France's cultural heritage and a fierce opponent of the antiquities trade. In early 2006, for example, he publicly protested the $200 million donation from the antiquities collector Shelby White (no relation) to N.Y.U. that is to be used to create a new Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, on the ground that some objects in Ms. White's collection are alleged to have come from illicit excavations.

His work on personal ornaments has taken him to museums all over the world, but particularly in the United States and Canada, where he has studied and published analyses of artifacts from France that had languished for decades in dusty drawers. Over the years, he has made France his second home, putting down deep roots in the country and its culture. He spends several months each year in the Périgord. Recently, he bought a stone farmhouse and several other buildings on 113 acres of land just outside Les Eyzies, which he shares with his longtime French companion, Hélène Talenton, who owns a beauty salon in a nearby community.

Dr. White is ''well accepted by the French archaeological community,'' said Alain Turq, curator of the Les Eyzies museum. ''He lives here and he speaks our language very well, which is very important.''

Today, the Périgord region is probably best known to tourists for its truffles, foie gras and wine. But during the Upper Paleolithic period, about 10,000 to 40,000 years ago, the caves and rock shelters carved out by the Vézère and its tributaries some two million years earlier were buzzing with artistic activity.

A dozen miles upstream from Les Eyzies, prehistoric artists were painting the magnificent images of bulls, horses, reindeer and rhinoceroses at Lascaux Cave. Just north of the town, 19th-century archaeologists found a rich trove of art and bone tools, including the head of a mammoth carved on a piece of ivory, in a rock shelter called La Madeleine, which gave its name to the so-called Magdalenian culture that marks the epitome of the Upper Paleolithic in France.

Between these two sites, at Le Moustier, Hauser in 1908 found the skull of a Neanderthal adolescent, along with characteristic Neanderthal stone tools from what is now referred to as the Mousterian culture.

Dr. White, 54, who was born and grew up in Canada's Alberta Province and has maintained his Canadian nationality, came to the Périgord in 1974 while an undergraduate anthropology student at the University of Alberta.

''I fell in love with southern France, its archaeology, and its ambience,'' he said. ''I discovered that I was a francophile.''

For his doctoral thesis at the University of Toronto, Dr. White conducted the first topographical survey of all the 180 known Upper Paleolithic sites in the region. ''I still get calls from people asking where is this or that site,'' he said.

Dr. White was hired by N.Y.U. in 1981, and the next year published a paper in the journal Current Anthropology that made his reputation. In that and subsequent publications, he has argued that modern humans were able to replace Neanderthals in Europe not necessarily because they had superior cognition, but because they developed long-range social networks that allowed them to better adapt to local conditions.

The dramatic explosion of art in Upper Paleolithic Europe, and especially the creation of uniformly designed personal ornaments that early humans seemed to use to identify themselves as part of the same group -- behaviors that Neanderthals engaged in only minimally, at best -- allowed the Homo sapien newcomers to out-compete their rivals, Dr. White maintained.

His ideas have been challenged by archaeologists who think that Neanderthal symbolic expression has been underestimated, as well as by researchers who think that the supposed ''explosion'' is really a continuation of nascent symbolic behavior in Africa going back at least 75,000 years. Nevertheless, Dr. Tattersall of the Museum of Natural History says, Dr. White's work has demonstrated that ''the Upper Paleolithic is a remarkable period, as much for the density and vividness of its creative manifestations as for the contrasts it provides with the cultures that preceded it.''

Despite Dr. White's early success, he found it difficult to begin a dig of his own in the Périgord. Dr. White says that the French prehistorian responsible for issuing permits to excavate in the area preferred that he work as part of his team rather than independently.

''I was shut out of working in France the way I wanted to do it,'' Dr. White said. Rather than agree to work as part of the team, he began to look at collections of artifacts stored in museums in Canada and the United States, where he found thousands of objects from digs by Peyrony and other archaeologists, including artifacts from the Abri Castanet, sometimes stored in terrible conditions.

''I saw Upper Paleolithic engravings with drawers on top of them,'' Dr. White said, adding that these experiences fueled his early anger about the antiquities trade.

In the late 1970s, Dr. White had met René Castanet, a local landowner and the son of one of the region's most celebrated amateur archaeologists, Marcel Castanet, after whom the Abri Castanet was named. The two men soon developed a close friendship. In the mid-1990s, when Dr. White applied for permission to reopen excavations at Abri Castanet, he now had two things going for him: ''an enormous credibility from all the research I had done,'' he said, and his relationship with René Castanet, who owned the land the rock shelter sat on and whose permission was necessary to dig there.

Getting his own site to dig sealed Dr. White's reputation in French archaeology and gave him the foothold he needed to indulge his interests in the history of the French antiquities trade as well as to challenge conventional accounts of the Hauser affair.

The five years he spent researching his book ''was the work of a monk,'' says Alain Roussot, who was curator of the Museum of the Aquitaine in Bordeaux from 1962 to 2000 and has known Dr. White since he first starting working in France. Dr. Roussot, who helped correct Dr. White's French text, adds that his investigation was ''very meticulous.''

Yet not everyone in the Périgord is ready to accept all of Dr. White's conclusions about Peyrony and the fish. ''Things were more complicated back then,'' said Dr. Turq of the Les Eyzies museum. ''Hauser made no permanent contributions to French archaeology, while Peyrony invested his money in excavations and built the museum in Les Eyzies. It was a different time.''

	Drug Regulators Are Trying To Quash Study, Senator Says


The tension and intrigue surrounding a crucial federal drug advisory committee meeting next week, already high, reached a boil on Friday when Senator Charles E. Grassley charged that top federal drug regulators intended to suppress an important study.

The panel has been convened to discuss whether Celebrex and Bextra, heavily selling arthritis pills from Pfizer, hurt the heart and are worth their potential risks. But top officials of the Food and Drug Administration have forbidden Dr. David Graham, a drug-safety officer at the agency, to discuss before the panel a large study of that very question, said Dr. Gurkirpal Singh of Stanford University School of Medicine, Dr. Graham's co-author.

''We have significant new information that will alter the thinking about these drugs,'' Dr. Singh said. ''I don't understand why they won't let us present this information.''

Mr. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, wrote a letter Friday to the agency's acting commissioner, Dr. Lester Crawford, demanding to know by Monday the reason for the agency's decision.

Dr. Graham expressed frustration that F.D.A. officials had instructed him not to discuss the new study in a presentation he is scheduled to give to the committee on Thursday.

''This study bears directly on the whole reason why this advisory meeting is being held in the first place,'' Dr. Graham said.

Agency officials told him the study had not yet been properly vetted, he said.

A spokesman for the agency denied that Dr. Graham had been barred from presenting the new findings. He said that agency officials had simply expressed a preference ''that he rely on published literature in his talk, but that it was his call if he wanted to offer data from his new study.''

The latest charge suggests that the panel will render judgment not only on the safety of Celebrex and Bextra but also on how well the F.D.A. is doing its job.

A series of controversies have called into question whether the agency has the tools or the will to protect patients' health.

Some in Congress, including Mr. Grassley, are calling for fundamental changes at the agency. Drug-safety advocates claim that top agency officials are far too cozy with drug makers. Agency officials say they are doing a good job.

Both sides point to the story of Vioxx, a pain pill similar to Celebrex and Bextra that Merck withdrew from the market in September, an action that will also be discussed at the hearing.

''There seems to be this view that we did something wrong with Vioxx,'' Dr. Robert Temple, director of the agency's office of medical affairs, said in an interview. ''What exactly is the thing that we did wrong? Approving it? Making them do a 6,000-patient study to get a claim? What?''

Mr. Grassley had a quick answer. ''The Vioxx disaster and its aftermath have shaken the public's confidence in the Food and Drug Administration,'' he said, in part because, instead of listening to its best scientists, the agency is ''sitting down to negotiate with drug companies.''

Vera Sharav, president of the Alliance for Human Research Protection, said that the Vioxx story demonstrated that ''the F.D.A. has abandoned its public responsibility to protect us from unsafe drugs and is standing by as drug companies market lethal drugs.''

A Merck spokeswoman said that the company had acted appropriately in its research, marketing and eventual withdrawal of Vioxx.

Pfizer representatives say that studies show that Celebrex and Bextra are safe.

There is a sense of déjà vu to Dr. Singh's latest charge. The agency convened an advisory panel a year ago to discuss whether antidepressants cause children and teenagers to become suicidal. Dr. Andrew Mosholder, another drug-safety officer for the agency, had concluded that the drugs did increase the risks of suicide. Top officials were skeptical of his findings and would not let him testify about his data before the panel.

A second study eventually confirmed Dr. Mosholder's conclusions, but the agency's refusal to let Dr. Mosholder testify caused a firestorm of criticism and prompted Mr. Grassley to begin an investigation of the agency.

The advisory panel will meet for three days beginning on Wednesday. It already has a mountain of data to sort through.

At the end of the hearings, the committee will be asked whether Celebrex and Bextra should be withdrawn or whether warnings on their labels should simply be strengthened.

The committee may debate whether the withdrawal of Vioxx was appropriate. And the committee will also discuss what, if any, studies of the drugs should be undertaken, according to F.D.A. documents.

	Study Says Drug's Dangers Were Apparent Years Ago


Merck and federal officials should have withdrawn the painkiller Vioxx from the market as early as 2000 because studies of the drug had clearly shown that it doubled the risk of heart attacks among users, according to a study released yesterday by The Lancet, a British medical journal.

Authors of the study pooled data from 25,273 patients who participated in 18 clinical trials conducted before 2001. They found that patients given Vioxx had 2.3 times the risk of heart attacks as those given placebos or other pain medications. Merck withdrew Vioxx on Sept. 30 of this year after a company-sponsored trial found a doubling of the risks for heart attack or stroke among those who took the medicine for 18 months or more.

An editorial accompanying the study criticized both Merck and the Food and Drug Administration, and described Vioxx's approval and its popularity as ''public health catastrophes'' that led to over 27,000 heart attacks and sudden deaths.

''For with Vioxx, Merck and the F.D.A. acted out of ruthless, short-sighted and irresponsible self-interest,'' wrote Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet.

In a statement, Merck said that the Lancet study was not comprehensive or new. ''Merck was vigilant in monitoring and disclosing the cardiovascular safety of Vioxx, and we absolutely disagree with any implication to the contrary,'' the company said.

The Lancet study increases pressure on the F.D.A., which is dealing with allegations that it tried to squelch prescient warnings by its own drug-safety reviewers about the dangers of Vioxx and about the hazards of antidepressant use by children and teenagers.

Committees in the House and Senate are investigating the F.D.A.'s handling of those issues. More hearings are expected.

In his editorial, Mr. Horton wrote that the F.D.A. failed to act after a 2001 analysis demonstrated the risks of Vioxx. He called for a thorough revamping of the agency's process for reviewing drug safety.

Dr. Sandra Kweder, the deputy director of the F.D.A.'s Office of New Drugs, said that many of Mr. Horton's assertions were ''flat-out wrong.'' She noted that the entire heart attack risk found when pooling data of the 18 Vioxx studies came from a single study. The F.D.A. examined the results of that trial closely, Dr. Kweder said, and the agency made sure Merck was conducting more studies on the matter.

''We knew we were getting more data as well as ongoing studies and ongoing placebo-controlled studies that could be extremely useful in answering the question'' of whether Vioxx caused heart attacks, she said.

Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic and one of the first to call attention to the heart problems presented by Vioxx, said in an interview that he had never read a more powerful editorial in a medical journal.

''It is unquestionable that the risks of the drug were known some time ago and not duly acknowledged, and this study is the best yet to prove that,'' Dr. Topol said.

Tony Butler, an analyst for Lehman Brothers, said that the recent slide in Merck's share price -- down 40 percent since Sept. 29 -- suggested that investors believe that Merck's liability for Vioxx is about $20 billion. Mr. Butler said that projection is highly inflated, because very few drug withdrawals result in such a huge legal bill.

''The fears expressed by so many others seem exaggerated with the information that we know today,'' Mr. Butler said.

Vioxx is a member of a class of painkillers called COX-2 inhibitors, which also includes the Celebrex and Bextra drugs made by Pfizer. Studies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery have found that Bextra increased risks to the heart. In rare cases, Bextra can also cause a fatal skin reaction.

Pfizer has said that Celebrex had not been found to pose cardiac risks. But Pfizer shares tumbled Thursday after The National Post in Toronto reported that Celebrex may have contributed to at least 14 deaths, according to incidents reported to Canada's health regulator.

Pfizer called the article ''misleading'' and Maria Valois, a top official at Health Canada, noted that the data cited by the newspaper was difficult to interpret.

''The crude number of events cannot be used to estimate the risk'' of Celebrex or any other drug, Dr. Valois said in a telephone conference with reporters.

Health Canada has asked Pfizer for more safety data, Dr. Valois said.

Earlier in the day, Pfizer shares fell to $27.20, a 52-week low. But by the end of trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Pfizer's stock had largely recovered, closing at $29.06, down 39 cents.

Top F.D.A. officials have said that the agency had no data indicating that Celebrex or Bextra resulted in elevated risks to the heart. Early next year the agency will convene a panel of outside experts to review the evidence regarding the entire COX-2 class of medicines.

	New Work May Provide Stem Cells While Taking Baby From Equation


In a development that may sidestep some of the ethical issues surrounding stem cell research, a scientist here says he has created stem cells that can turn into nerve cells using a kind of embryo that cannot develop into a baby.

The work, done in mice, is one of several recent experiments that explore the usefulness of asexual reproduction in deriving stem cells.

The researcher, Dr. Jerry L. Hall, uses chemicals to coax an egg to grow into an embryo of sorts without being fertilized by a male's sperm. Such embryos, even if implanted into a womb, would not grow to become viable babies, Dr. Hall and other experts said. But the embryos can be grown in a laboratory for a few days, long enough to become a source of stem cells.

Embryonic stem cells can turn into virtually all types of the body's cells, potentially providing replacement cells that can be transplanted into patients to cure diseases. But opponents say such research is immoral because deriving stem cells involves destroying embryos, which they see as nascent human life.

Dr. Hall argues that if an ''embryo'' were not formed by conception and would not be able to turn into a child, that might make stem cell work more acceptable.

''We feel that this really could circumvent a lot of ethical concerns,'' said Dr. Hall, an embryologist at the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Genetic Testing, a fertility clinic here. He presented his work at the annual meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Orlando, Fla., late last month.

But Richard M. Doerflinger of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the technique was unlikely to end the opposition the Roman Catholic Church has to embryonic stem cell work.

The real question, he said, is whether these are really embryos. If they are, ''the fact that these beings would not survive to birth does not answer the question,'' he said. ''Our teaching about the embryo does not rely on it having been created by fertilization.''

Numerous scientific questions remain as well about the work, which has not been published in a scientific journal. Dr. Hall, who did the research with Dr. Yan-Ling Feng of the Center for Reproductive Research and Testing in Rockville, Md., said they had not determined whether the stem cells could turn into other types of cells, or even whether the nerve cells were normal.

Dr. Hall said he had not yet tried to derive human stem cells this way.  But others are getting closer to that. The University of Massachusetts has applied for a patent on using the technique to derive stem cells from primates, including humans. The work was done with Advanced Cell Technology, a stem cell and cloning company in Worcester, Mass.

Scientists at the university and the company derived a line of stem cells from monkeys that could be maintained for months and that spontaneously differentiated into many types of cells including beating heart cells, according to the patent application, which has been published in Europe but not yet granted.

Dr. Michael West, chief executive of Advanced Cell Technology, would not comment when asked if the company had tried this in humans. He also would not discuss the company's work in detail, saying he did not want to jeopardize an upcoming publication in a scientific journal.

The work takes advantage of a phenomenon known as parthenogenesis. It is known that some species of flowers, insects, lizards and snakes can reproduce asexually, with the female's egg growing into a baby without being fertilized by a male..

Parthenogenesis, which is from the Greek for virgin birth, does not occur naturally in mammals. But for decades scientists have known how to trick the eggs of mice, rabbits and other mammals into developing as if they had been fertilized by subjecting the eggs to various chemicals or to temperature changes, needle pricks or electrical shocks. The resulting embryos are called parthenotes. It has not been reported that this has ever been done with human eggs, however, and it would raise ethical questions.

An egg has a full number of chromosomes right up until fertilization, when it ejects half of them and receives a half set from the sperm. So if this ejection is suppressed, an egg will have the full number of chromosomes.

The embryos created this way would not be clones of the woman, Dr. Hall said, because the chromosomes in an egg are somewhat different from the woman's set. Still, he said, the tissues derived from stem cells from such embryos would be close enough to a woman's own tissues that they would not be rejected if transplanted back into the woman.

Another possible way to develop such compatible tissues is to use stem cells made by cloning the patient's own cells. The idea, known as therapeutic cloning, is to take genetic material from a patient's cell and fuse it with an egg that is missing its own nucleus, creating an embryo that is a genetic copy of the patient. But because an embryo made through that method would in theory be able to develop into a person, Roman Catholic authorities and other abortion opponents have objected.

To create the parthenotes, Dr. Hall and Dr. Feng bathed the mouse egg cells in alcohol and then exposed them to a chemical called cytochalasin D. About 30 percent of the eggs were activated and 40 percent of those went on to form a blastocyst, a several-day-old embryo from which stem cells can be taken. The stem cells were treated with retinoic acid to turn them into nerve cells.

Dr. Azim Surani, a professor of biology at Cambridge University, said the work was not surprising since he and others had derived parthenogenetic stem cells more than a decade ago and saw evidence that they would turn into nerve cells. But he said it was unclear how many other types of cells could be created this way. ''They don't form muscle cells very easily,'' he said.

Dr. Surani also said the parthenotes and any tissues derived from them might be abnormal. That is because in normal embryo development, certain genes from the father but not the mother, or vice versa, are turned on. But parthenotes don't have genes from the father, so this process, called imprinting, would go awry. Lack of imprinting is also probably the reason that parthenotes do not develop into babies, he said.

Still, Dr. West said it might be possible one day to produce human babies through parthenogenesis.  Male parthenotes could be created, too, he said, by replacing the DNA in an egg with the DNA from two of a male's sperm cells.

But male and female parthenotes have shown differences, said Dr. Jose Cibelli, vice president for research at Advanced Cell Technology. Stem cells derived from male par thenotes tend to turn into muscle cells, while stem cells from female parthenotes turned more often into brain and nerve cells, he said.

Dr. West said that if this process could be used to produce live offspring it would open up vast new reproductive possibilities. A woman could give birth by herself. Or two men may be able to each contribute one sperm to have a baby together.

	Are Women Necessary?


Abundant evidence suggests that females are the first sex, the ancestral sex, the sex from which males are derived.

Boys owe their lives to their mothers in more ways than one. Yet recent experiments with stem cells hint that women, not men, may eventually prove obsolete.

Granted, a post-feminine future sounds far-fetched. In many species, including our own, the fundamental body plan is female, with maleness being a bit of window-dressing tacked on at the last minute.

Some groups of insects, fish and lizards consist entirely of females, which give birth only to daughters. By contrast, no self-sustaining, boys-only population has ever arisen in nature, the efforts of certain Southern golf tournaments notwithstanding.

Indeed, males are famous for their cheap, abbreviated gametes, and their poignant need for the warmth and wealth of the comparatively massive female sex cell to realize their dreams of immortality. You'd think they would be humble, grateful, even obsequious. But it seems that somewhere along the way those slippery flagella figured out a possible pathway to go it alone.

Here are the unnerving results that threaten the matriarchy: last spring, after years of effort, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and elsewhere announced that they could grow working egg cells in the laboratory if they started with embryo tissue taken from either a female or a male mouse.

These hothouse eggs and their accompanying follicular matrix were so persuasive they even secreted and responded to estrogen, the archetypically ''female'' hormone.

In September, Japanese researchers said they could create robust little sperm cells in the lab, too -- but only if they began with the embryonic stem cells of a male animal. It turns out that the program for making eggs is stored on the chromosomes that males and females share. To manufacture sperm, however, you need that truncated, genetically penurious Y chromosome that only a male can claim.

In theory, then, male starter cells could be used to make eggs and sperm, and those eggs and sperm could be mixed together to yield a new generation. This would not be parthenogenesis as seen in whiptail lizards or Nature's other little sororities, with the parent capable only of spawning more of its own sex and hence being limited in its power to genomically outfox parasites.

This would be like old-fashioned, shake-'em-up, male-female sexual reproduction, a meeting of eggs and sperm. You could mix and match your fabricated eggs and sperm to generate boys and girls alike.

Except why bother with girls, if you don't need mothers to lay those little egg cells in the first place? You could have robust diversity in the human gene pool without the need for pesky separate restrooms.

True, women at the moment remain useful for their possession of another baby-friendly device, the uterus. But how long will this anatomical detail be an impediment to complete female obsolescence?

Already, researchers can keep baby goats alive in an artificial uterus, a big fishbowl of bubbling fluid, for weeks at a stretch. A full-term, full-service exoamniotic cocoon cannot be far behind.

Given such recent and imminent developments, Rebecca West, journalist, novelist and companion of H. G. ''Doomsday'' Wells, was eerily prescient in her observation that motherhood is ''like being one's own Trojan horse.''

Yet as women contemplate their pending irrelevance, they can take heart in a more immediate lesson to be gleaned from the latest experimental results. If inside every man's genome is a little mother yearning to be free, well, then, no more excuses when it's time to change the diapers.

	Mental Decline Is Linked To Heart Bypass Surgery


Five years after heart bypass surgery, 42 percent of patients show a significant decline on tests of mental ability, probably from brain damage caused by the surgery, doctors from Duke University say in a new study.

Older patients and those with a drop in test scores soon after surgery were most likely to show declines five years later. The report, being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, has evoked mixed reactions among experts.

On the one hand, they say that a lowered test score does not necessarily mean a person is mentally impaired and that the 42 percent figure might needlessly frighten patients away from surgery that could save their lives. On the other hand, researchers concede that the study was done well and that it highlights an ugly truth that surgeons know but are not eager to discuss with patients: some patients do wind up mentally impaired after bypass surgery. And doctors are not sure why, though they suspect various factors that interfere with blood flow to the brain during surgery.

The findings also seem likely to fuel the debate about whether all of the approximately 500,000 bypass operations done each year in the United States are necessary, or whether more patients with blocked arteries, particularly older people, should be treated with medication or less invasive procedures to open clogged blood vessels.

The researchers are not the first to link mental decline to bypass operations. But earlier studies were shorter term, and many doctors hoped that the cognitive losses would be temporary. The new study is the first to show lasting changes in so many patients so long after the surgery.

The study, based on 261 patients who had bypass surgery at Duke from 1989 to 1993, relied on mental tests done before surgery and then six weeks, six months and five years later. The patients' average age was 61, with a range of 50 to 71. Patients were considered to have declined mentally if their test performance at five years was at least 20 percent lower than their score before surgery. A 20 percent drop was similar to the difference in function between subjects at ages 40 and 60.

The drop in scores in the bypass patients could not be attributed to aging, the authors said, because it was more than two to three times the mental decline found in 5,888 Medicare patients who did not have bypass surgery and whose cognitive abilities were followed for five years in a separate study.

A doctor not associated with the study, William A. Baumgartner, chief of cardiac surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said researchers at his hospital were also studying the problem but had found far fewer patients with significant long-term problems, perhaps 8 percent to 10 percent.

''I was shocked at the 42 percent,'' Dr. Baumgartner said. ''We just haven't seen that in our five-year follow-up. People who read this thing are going to be scared out of their minds that they're going to be some kind of invalid. In our series, that is clearly not the case. They need further work to see how this affects the well-being of patients.''

Dr. Mark F. Newman, an author of the study and chief of cardiothoracic anesthesiology at Duke University Medical Center, said researchers were not sure how many of the patients were troubled by their declines or even aware of them, since the changes might not cause problems in their daily lives.

But Dr. Newman said he hoped the findings would not lead patients to shun bypass surgery. ''In a lot of patients, we prolong their life,'' he said. ''We have to continue working on improving the quality of their life as well.''

Several elements of bypass surgery can potentially cause brain damage, Dr. Newman said. One is the heart-lung machine, through which the patient's blood is circulated to pick up oxygen. Doctors suspect air bubbles produced by the machine may block blood flow through minute vessels in the skull, killing brain cells. The machine may also pump droplets of fat released from the surgical site to the brain, where they can cause the same problem as air bubbles. It is also possible that the machine does not provide enough oxygen for some patients.

The other possible source of trouble is fatty deposits in the patient's own aorta, the large vessel that carries blood out of the left side of the heart. Surgeons clamp the aorta and may sew blood vessels to it during bypass surgery; those procedures can break off deposits, which may then travel to the patient's head and block blood flow.

Dr. Newman said newer techniques in which the surgery was done without the machine, and with little or no manipulation of the aorta, might help to protect the brain. But not all patients are candidates for the new techniques. In the United States, about 20 percent of bypass operations are done without the heart-lung machine. The machine will always be needed for some types of cases, Dr. Newman said, and for that reason researchers are trying to develop drugs that patients can be given during surgery to help brain cells tolerate declines in blood pressure and oxygen level that cannot always be avoided during surgery.

But other researchers say it is not clear that the heart-lung machine should take all the blame. Dr. Ola A. Selnes, a neuropsychologist at Johns Hopkins, who wrote an editorial in the same issue, said other studies had shown cognitive declines in elderly patients who had operations not involving the heart; the stress of anesthesia and major surgery may have been too much for them.

Dr. Selnes noted that cognitive problems in bypass patients might be partly due to their underlying vascular disease, which affects blood vessels all over the body.

A weakness of the study, and of earlier ones, is the lack of a control group -- a set of patients who do not have bypass surgery but who have vascular disease similar to that in the surgical patients and who match them in age, sex, race, education level, lifestyle and so on. Only by comparing two such groups over time could researchers find out how much mental decline is due to bypass surgery and how much to vascular disease. Dr. Selnes said such a study was under way.

When answers do become available, Dr. Selnes said, it might be possible to identify patients who are particularly at risk for cognitive problems, and to suggest alternative treatments to bypass surgery. ''Not everyone has to have bypass,'' Dr. Selnes said. ''There are choices. Of these 600,000 being done very year, only a subset really require what you might call emergency surgery.''

Other patients, he said, could be offered medical treatment or less invasive procedures like balloon angioplasty to open clogged vessels.

''There has been a kind of blind faith that bypass is the ultimate answer to any kind of heart disease, and I think that has to be rethought,'' Dr. Selnes said.

	Saving the Heart Can Sometimes Mean Losing the Memory


James Haneman believes his surgeons sacrificed his mind in saving his heart.

In 1989, Mr. Haneman had a law practice in New Orleans, earned a six-figure salary and sat on several important state and federal law committees. Then he had a heart attack and surgery to bypass blockages in his coronary arteries.

He came through the surgery fine -- physically. But since then, Mr. Haneman says, he has had memory problems and even simple tasks, like writing letters, elude him. His doctors told him the problems would be only temporary. ''They told me not to make any important decisions for a month,'' he recalled.

But when he returned to work, he recalled, ''I could study something and not be ready to say it the next day, particularly in the order it had to be presented.'' The doctors told him to wait another month.

Frustrated, he turned to self-help tapes and books on memory enhancement. He tried computer exercises and reading nonfiction. But his problems persisted and after two years he quit practicing law. ''When you can't remember anything, you can't practice law,'' he said. ''I was doing my clients an injustice.''

Though Mr. Haneman is an extreme example, heart surgeons say he is not alone. Doctors say evidence is mounting that a small but significant number of bypass patients suffer some degree of cognitive impairment, like memory and attention deficits and language problems, particularly if they spend time on heart-lung machines.

These patients are apart from the approximately 2 percent to 5 percent of patients who suffer strokes after bypass surgery, a procedure 600,000 Americans undergo each year.

It is unknown how many patients suffer the less catastrophic, but nevertheless debilitating, cognitive problems. Depending on how the problem is defined, studies suggest that anywhere from 10 percent to 50 percent or more of bypass patients do poorly on tests of memory, language and spatial orientation six months after surgery. These changes can persist years after surgery, and in many cases are probably irreversible.

A significant number of these patients will have recognizable problems in their day-to-day lives. It is estimated that the total cost of these problems exceeds $1 billion a year.

In part, experts say, the incidence of the problem is increasing because older, sicker patients are now being offered bypass operations. In the early 1980's, the average age of bypass patients was about 58, according to Dr. John Murkin, director of cardiac anesthesia at the University of Western Ontario in Canada. Now, it is 66.

''As we operate on older and older patients, because of the accumulated burden of disease in their blood vessels, we're seeing more neurological injury,'' Dr. Murkin said.

In part, experts say, the cognitive impairment itself is the result of stroke, particularly ''ministrokes'' that patients can suffer when fatty material is dislodged from the aorta, the body's largest blood vessel, when it is clamped in order to shunt blood into a heart-lung machine.

The acts of clamping and unclamping can break the hardened fat coating the wall of the aorta into tiny pieces, like pliers squeezing an eggshell, which can then lodge in the brain. ''On video it looks like a snowstorm,'' said Denise Barbut, former director of stroke research at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University, who has used ultrasound to study the flow of these particles during bypass surgery.

Experts say there are probably several other contributing factors, including tiny blood clots or bubbles from the heart-lung machine, inadequate blood flow to the brain during surgery and brain inflammation.

Whatever the cause, the syndrome is so pervasive that heart surgeons and cardiologists have coined a term for it: pump head. Some even go so far as to encourage some patients to seek other remedies for their heart disease.

''A high-functioning 75-year-old who I might normally be very aggressive about bypassing, I might try to manage medically or with angioplasty,'' said Dr. Richard Fuchs, a cardiologist in private practice in Manhattan, referring to powerful heart drugs and balloon procedures that open up blocked arteries without surgery. Other experts say they save this advice for patients who already have some sort of cognitive impairment.

Some experts say some of the cognitive problems after bypass surgery may actually result from depression, which for reasons that are unclear develops in many patients after the surgery.

In any event, the cognitive impairment occurs in a minority of patients. ''I have a fairly large cadre of patients who tell me they've never been better,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Gold, chairman of cardiothoracic surgery at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. ''Many will tell you they're much more creative and prolific, that they haven't suffered any cognitive decline whatsoever.''

Dr. Gold points out that some research shows that knee-replacement surgery can result in similar cognitive impairment and that bypass surgery done off a heart-lung pump results in stroke rates similar to those when conventional bypass surgery is done on pump. ''I think pump head is a misnomer,'' he said. ''The implication is that the cognitive decline is due to the pump, and that if you avoid it you're safe, but that doesn't appear to be the case.''

When patients have cognitive changes after surgery, the effects are often subtle. They may think a little slower or feel ''clouded.'' They may forget appointments or where they put things. They may become irritable or depressed.

''The defects can be subtle and patients can often compensate for them,'' said Dr. Mehmet Oz, a professor of cardiothoracic surgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. ''On the other hand, if their functioning is already low, the results can be debilitating.''

Sometimes the changes can be a bit bizarre. ''Suddenly the type of food or the type of restaurant they like changes,'' said Dr. Mani Subramanian, chief of cardiothoracic surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. Dr. Gold of Montefiore said one of his patients recently had called after bypass surgery to say he was feeling well and was back at work. ''But he told me, 'I can't stand the taste of lettuce anymore.' He used to eat a lot of salad, but that changed after surgery.''

For Paul Wechsler, a 60-year-old former architect who lives in New Jersey, the changes were not subtle or bizarre, just painful. ''The bypass surgery knocked out a lot of my memory,'' he said from his home, where he spends most of his days. ''It changed my whole life around mentally.''

The memory problems started immediately after his bypass surgery in 1996. He told his doctor about them, and was assured they would be temporary. But in the following months he did not improve. He found himself asking his fiancee to calculate the tip at restaurants. ''I couldn't understand jokes that she would tell me,'' he said. ''Even now, she'll say something to me and I'll say, 'What do you mean by that?' ''

He had been running his own construction business and working as a salesman before the surgery, but he had to quit. ''I used to enjoy the challenge of building things up from nothing,'' he said, but it gave him fits. Though he believes his mental functioning may now be starting to improve, he remains on permanent disability. ''I still have to read a paragraph three times to get the meaning,'' he said.

To avoid the potentially deleterious effects of heart-lung machines, surgeons have developed off-pump, or beating-heart, bypass surgery.  Here, surgeons insert a clamp through a small incision in the chest wall to immobilize a small section of the beating heart. A new vessel is then stitched, while the heart continues to pump blood to the brain and the rest of the body. Aortic clamping and a heart-lung machine can be avoided. The surgery is relatively new, however, and most bypass surgery is still done on pump.

But studies of whether off-pump surgery protects against pump head have not produced clear results. Dr. Oz of Columbia is now conducting a  study, the largest to date, in which 600 bypass patients will be randomly treated with on-  or off-pump surgery and studied for cognitive decline. ''If we're going to make decisions affecting the lives of 600,000 people a year, we don't want to base that on the results of a small trial,'' he said.

Other treatments for pump head are being developed. Embolex, a Northern California company founded by Dr. Barbut, the neurologist, has designed a filter to catch debris from the aorta during surgery. Another company, Cardeon, has developed a balloon device that opens up inside the aorta during surgery, shutting off blood flow and obviating the need for a clamp.

Some experts believe that more attention is being paid to pump head today because more catastrophic results, like strokes and deaths, have sharply decreased as anesthesia and surgical techniques have improved.  The mortality rate for bypass surgery is now less than 1 percent. ''The nice thing is that today we can worry about the subtle changes,'' said Dr. Mark Newman, chairman of anesthesiology at Duke University Medical Center.

Dr. Gold of Montefiore said the decision about whether to perform bypass surgery on or off pump can be made in the operating room. He recently had a 52-year-old patient who expressed concern before surgery about intellectual decline. After opening up the patient's chest in the operating room and discovering by ultrasound that his aorta was lined with a large amount of plaque, Dr. Gold decided to do the bypass surgery off pump.

''The most important thing, in my humble opinion, is to be flexible,'' Dr. Gold said. ''The goal is to fit to the patient's needs, not artificially choose a surgical modality.'' He added that for the majority of patients, on-pump surgery -- the most studied -- was their best option.

	Colors Are Truly Brilliant In Trek Up Mount Metaphor


Hovering above the ghoulish terrain, a visitor might feel transported to a distant planet. Rendered in black and white, the lay of the land would seem comfortably familiar: clusters of low, rounded foothills give way to higher, rougher ones, finally converging on majestic snowcapped peaks.

But the colors are all wrong. The alpine forests are a sickly chartreuse. The glaciers and snowfields are yellow at the bottom, orange in the middle, blood-red at the top. Elsewhere, a single peak, ascending through shades of bright yellow, fluorescent green and icy blue, juts above the crimson badlands like an obscenely protuberant Matterhorn.

Confronted with these images, which appeared in the journal Science, one might think they were digital photographs sent across space from a Viking or a Voyager, an exercise in extraterrestrial cartography.

But the territory exists only in the realm of abstraction, as arrangements of data in two experiments that have nothing to do with outer space. One involves genetics, the other quantum physics. In each, scientists are trying to get a better feel for their data by imagining it as a mathematical mountain range -- one of the most dominant metaphors in science.

Explaining the strange in terms of the familiar -- that is the essence of the scientific quest. In every field, from molecular biology to cosmology, data are sorted and analyzed mathematically. But in the end, the gray numbers are often translated into colorful three-dimensional pictures, the language human brains comprehend best. Using metaphor and analogy, the tools of artists and poets, abstract patterns take on substance and become lodged more firmly in the mind.

For many people, a ''mountain of data'' evokes a heaping pile of unorganized information. But in science, the phrase can mean data arranged with exquisite precision. Following a trend in the numbers becomes an ascent along a ridgeline leading to a rocky precipice and a stunning view over an expansive valley.

The first landscape, what scientists call a gene expression map, depicts the functioning of the genome of the worm C. elegans. Understanding how its DNA operates can lead to insights about the human genome, a biochemical structure commonly thought of as a map, a blueprint, an enciphered text or, more recently, as cellular software, the operating system for the cell.

Adopting instead the montane metaphor, scientists at the Stanford University School of Medicine distilled data from 553 experiments performed by 30 laboratories into an image they hoped would give an intuitive feel for how the worm's 19,000-plus genes interact. (The work, drawing on the computational talents of Stanford Medical Informatics and Sandia National Laboratories, in Albuquerque, was published in the Sept. 14 issue of Science.)

Each of the 44 mountains represents a group of genes that, though scattered throughout the worm's genome, become active under the same conditions, producing proteins that various cells need to conduct their affairs. (The significance of 14 of the peaks remains unknown, terra incognita.) The higher the mountain, the more genes it represents, ranging from the towering Mount Zero, a dizzying 2,703 genes high, down to Mount 43, a lowly hillock of five genes. As on a relief map, the arbitrary colors help the eye get a quick fix on the topography.

Though similar in contour, the second image, which appeared on the cover of Science in 1995, represents not genes but molecules of a substance called rubidium used in research that won this year's Nobel Prize in Physics. Here the altitude of the mountain indicates how fast the molecules are moving, with speed decreasing as the eye ascends into the chilly heights. The colors represent the number of atoms moving at each velocity, red being the fewest and white the most.

At the peak, most of the atoms are frozen near absolute zero, converging into a single superatom called a Bose-Einstein condensate. In this exotic substance, the rules of quantum mechanics allow thousands of atoms to crowd into the same place at the same time -- resulting in a new state of matter.

Like pictures in National Geographic, the most arresting scientific images inspire feelings of wanderlust, a desire to lose oneself in a far-off land. A depiction of the data showing how high-speed laser pulses were used to manipulate the spins of electrons in a substance called zinc cadmium selenide becomes an eerily symmetrical iceberg, casting its lonely reflection in a frigid, impossibly still pond. The research by physicists at the University of California at Santa Barbara and Penn State University, earned the cover spot of the June 29 issue of Science.

High-speed computers and sophisticated ''data mining'' software are producing increasingly refined visualizations. But the practice of bringing substance to abstractions with pictures and analogies is as old as science itself.

An individual electron is an evanescent entity, acting something like a particle and something like a wave. Really it is neither, hovering in a metaphorical territory in between. But when electrons move en masse as electricity through a wire, they can be pictured as a liquid. Current, or amperage, becomes equivalent to the rate of flow, and voltage to the pressure in the ''pipes.''

The metaphor has its limits. Cut a wire and you won't get wet, any more than you'll freeze on top of Gene Mountain. But the analogy helps the mind get a more visceral grip.

The sophisticated procedure used to make thousands of atoms sit still long enough to merge into a Bose-Einstein condensate can be precisely described with mathematics. But it is much more evocative, with a bit of poetic license, to call it ''optical cooling.'' Heat is defined, after all, as the random movement of atoms. So ambush each atom, hitting it from every direction with photon guns shooting tiny projectiles of light -- striking it this way and that way until it is almost stationary. The resulting glob of slow-motion matter is called optical molasses.

Metaphors are always inexact; in the quantum realm they are stretched to the breaking point. Physicists talk about a subatomic particle's ''spin.'' Like a top, a particle can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. But take the analogy too far and it crumbles. An ordinary top can revolve faster or slower across a smooth range of speeds. Particles, being quantum in nature, can spin only at certain fixed velocities, preset by nature. And they can spin in various combinations -- 43 percent clockwise and 57 percent counterclockwise, for example -- at the same time.

Less tangible still is a quality called isotopic spin. The nuclei of atoms are built from Janus-faced particles called nucleons. If a nucleon's ''isospin'' is counterclockwise, it acts as a positively charged proton; reverse the direction and it becomes a chargeless neutron. But these pirouettes take place in a purely mathematical realm, an artificial space whose dimensions have nothing to do with height, width or length.

Space itself has become a metaphor. Think of cyberspace, which can be explored but not measured, or the ''desktop'' of your personal computer, a simulated expanse across which you ''drag'' folders and icons. The motion is illusory. All your mouse strokes are really doing is rapidly switching pixels on and off.

You can construct your own ''restaurant space'' describing the dining in your neighborhood. Categorize them according to three parameters -- price, quality and years in business -- and plot the information on a three-dimensional graph. Each restaurant becomes a point in an abstract space in which nearness is a measure of similarity. Two adjacent establishments might be blocks apart in the physical world.

There is no need to stop with three dimensions. Imagine another axis measuring the number of tables and another measuring the variety of wines in the cellar. Now you have a five-dimensional ''hyperspace,'' impossible to really picture but something that scientists use all the time.

It is not always clear whether a space is real or artificial. Super string theory holds that the particles making up matter and energy are secondary manifestations -- epiphenomena -- generated by tiny objects called strings and branes vibrating in a space of 10 dimensions. The theory is enormously successful on paper, but a question, perhaps unanswerable, lingers: are these extra dimensions physical or mental, like restaurant space?

Sometimes metaphors are outgrown. The biggest break in the Human Genome Project actually came half a century ago, when scientists realized that DNA could be thought of as a text, the chemical letters spelling out instructions for making and operating cells. But you can take a metaphor only so far. As experiments reveal how dynamic the genome is, with genes switching each other on and off, it begins to seem like a text that can read and edit itself -- less like a book than a computer. But is DNA software or hardware? It is a little of each. As with wave/particle duality, neither metaphor exactly fits.

As the discoveries of science become part of popular culture, the metaphorical flow sometimes goes the other way. Novelists look to science for linguistic lenses to cast the familiar in a new light. The patterns of circuitry on a computer chip are commonly compared with the layout of a modern city. In ''The Crying of Lot 49,'' Thomas Pynchon turned the tables, comparing a sterile, overly planned Southern California community (called San Narciso) to a computer chip. In his best-known novel, the parabolic arc of a missile is memorably called ''Gravity's Rainbow,'' a metaphor that seems especially apt if you remember a little college calculus.

In Jonathan Franzen's new novel, ''The Corrections,'' Arthur Lambert, a retired engineer, sits in his basement gloomily testing Christmas lights, only to discover in the depths of the tangle a blacked-out string of bulbs. A ''substantia nigra,'' Mr. Franzen calls it.

The metaphor, if a little obscure, is pitch perfect. The substantia nigra (''black substance'') is a region deep in the brain that produces the neurotransmitter dopamine. In a Pynchonian flip, electrical circuits are compared to neural circuits instead of the other way around. But the analogy cuts deeper. A burned-out substantia nigra is a symptom of Parkinsonism, the disease that afflicts Arthur. He is no more able to repair the Christmas lights than his doctors are able to fix his brain.

In another scene, visitors to a chic new restaurant, distinguished by its postindustrial design, sit inside a ''glassed-in dining room, suspended in a blue Cherenkov glow.'' Cherenkov radiation, produced by rapidly moving charged particles, is responsible for the eerie luminescence in pools of water shielding nuclear reactors.

And here is how the novel describes the neurotic dependence Arthur's son Chip has developed on his sister, because of all the money he owes her: ''He'd lived with the affliction of this debt until it had assumed the character of a neuroblastoma so intricately implicated in his cerebral architecture that he doubted he could survive its removal.''

By daring to use such allusions, Mr. Franzen compliments his readers. Novels like his are a reminder that in literature, as well as science, illuminating the intangible with a good metaphor is a powerful art.

	Tiniest of Particles Pokes Big Hole in Physics Theory


New observations of subatomic particles do not appear to fit into the standard theories explaining the matter and forces that shape the universe, scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory reported today.

The unexpected findings, made with a particle accelerator at the laboratory, may be the first glimpse of a previously unseen kind of matter. If the findings are confirmed, the heart of subatomic theory, called the Standard Model, will be ''insufficient to describe our universe,'' said Dr. Thomas B. Kirk, Brookhaven's associate director for high energy and nuclear physics.

Though the results announced today throw cherished ideas into question, particle physicists have been waiting for such a development for years because it opens a door into new worlds of theory and experimentation.

The scientists, from a dozen institutions in Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States, cautioned in interviews and at a news conference here today that there was a slim chance the results were a statistical fluke and that the Standard Model, which has held up for 30 years, would remain unchallenged.

But they said the experiments, which involved painstaking measurements of about a billion rare particles called muons (pronounced MEW-ons), had so far determined with 99 percent probability that the accepted theory had been breached. They said they were already gathering and analyzing more data that could eliminate the one chance in a hundred that their results were a fluke.

Muons are subatomic cousins of electrons. In the experiments described today, physicists measured muons' responses to magnetic fields. The results showed a large departure from predictions, based on the Standard Model, of the way muons wobbled in a powerful magnetic field, Dr. Kirk said.

Dr. Gerald Gabrielse, a professor and chairman of the physics department at Harvard University, called the results ''tremendously exciting'' because of the possible explanations for the discrepancy.

''It could lead to a whole deeper understanding of how reality is put together,'' Dr. Gabrielse said.  Among the leading possible reasons for the difference, physicists said, would be the existence of previously undetected particles with strange properties affecting the way the muons wobbled, or precessed, in the magnetic field.

In the Brookhaven experiment, called E821, muons created by a particle accelerator known as the Alternating Gradient Synchroton were injected into a powerful magnetic field and the frequency of their wobble was measured precisely.

Physicists have long known that the wobble rate is affected by the properties of space itself. Under the laws of quantum mechanics, which rule the subatomic realm, apparently empty space is actually a sea of what scientists call ''virtual particles'' that briefly appear and disappear and can interact with muons.

The Standard Model shows scientists how to calculate the effect that all known particles in that sea should have on the wobble frequency; those predicted shifts have been measured and verified with great precision. But the new measurements differ from those predictions, suggesting that previously unknown particles are also lurking in that subatomic sea, said Dr. Lee Roberts, a professor of physics at Boston University who is one of the spokesmen for the experiment.

''This whole experiment is based on measuring the effect of these virtual particles,'' Dr. Roberts said. ''There's a possibility that new particles that haven't been observed could be contributing.''

While those particles are not predicted by the Standard Model and have never been seen directly in an experiment, their existence would not surprise theorists. Despite the  model's success in explaining decades of experimental data, theorists believe it has logical and aesthetic flaws and that its complicated structure is unlikely to represent natural law at its most fundamental level.

To solve those problems, some physicists have developed a grander and much more speculative theory called supersymmetry. That theory solves many of those problems, by positing the existence of new particles, called supersymmetric partners, for each of the known particles.

Those partners are predicted to be relatively massive for subatomic particles and interact weakly with ordinary matter, making them difficult both to produce and to detect. But their existence could account for the unexplained shift in the wobble frequency, said Dr. William J. Marciano, a theorist at Brookhaven.

''The most natural meaning of this kind of indication,'' Dr. Marciano said, ''would be superymmetry.'' The observed change in the frequency, he said, ''fits supersymmetry like a glove.''

Dr. Frank Wilczek, a physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that the new result, though not statistically airtight, did mesh with what he called other indirect suggestions that supersymmetry might be the correct way to extend and shore up the Standard Model.

''It would mean that in describing the world, we would need to add to the equations of the Standard Model,'' Dr. Wilczek said. ''And those additions make the whole thing much prettier, more unified and more beautiful.''

If the Brookhaven experiments are an indirect indication that supersymmetric particles exist, then the size of the observed effect suggests that they could be produced and detected directly in a new generation of particle accelerators that will soon begin collecting data, several theorists said.

The first new machine to go into operation will be the upgraded Tevatron accelerator at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, outside Chicago, which will begin collecting data this spring.

''Certainly at the highest energy machines they will look in these energy ranges for these new particles,'' said Dr. Vernon Hughes, a Yale physicist who is a spokesman for the experiment.

Theorists said that they would also explore other ways of explaining the  data, like the possibility that particles believed to be elementary and indivisible are made of smaller entities, and that the structure of space itself may be more complex than mainstream physics assumes.

The new results were presented  today at a scientific colloquium by Dr. William M. Morse, a Brookhaven physicist who is a member of the experimental team and its resident spokesman.

The experiments begin when protons, electrically charged particles normally found in atomic nuclei, stream at nearly the speed of light and smash into a piece of nickel.

From the debris created by those collisions, physicists extract bunches containing thousands of muons. The scientists chose muons because, being more massive than electrons, they are more likely to interact with the relatively massive particles predicted by supersymmetry.

To make the measurements, the scientists relied on a quantum-mechanical property, called spin, that is shared by muons and other particles. Though the particles do not really spin, they do share some properties with an ordinary top. If the top's spin axis is not exactly vertical, it wobbles, or precesses, just as the muons do in a strong magnetic field.

The Brookhaven scientists observed precisely the frequency with which the muons wobbled, leading to the results presented today. Dr. Morse said that the team had already made observations of several billion muons, but had finished analyzing the results from only about a billion of them.

By coincidence, Dr. Hughes studied under Isidor I. Rabi, the Nobel Prize winner who uttered a memorable line when the muon was a surprise discovery in the 1930's.

''Who ordered that?'' Professor Rabi asked.

When asked for a corresponding reaction to the new finding, Dr. Hughes thought for a moment and said, ''The people who do supersymmetry ordered it.''

	The Columbia Space Shuttle's Crew of 6 Americans and 1 Israeli


Seven astronauts, six Americans and an Israeli, died aboard the shuttle Columbia yesterday. Of the crew of five men and two women, four had never flown in space before.

Dr. Laurel Salton Clark  After Sea and Sky, Moving On to Space

Laurel Salton Clark had conquered the sea, diving with the Navy Seals and conducting medical evacuations from submarines off Scotland. She had penetrated the air as a flight surgeon aboard the Marine Attack Squadron of the Year.

Space was the logical next frontier.

''She was never one of these people to say, 'O.K., I found what I want to do,' it was always, 'What's the next challenge?' '' said Dr. Clark's younger brother, Daniel Salton. ''She was one of these people who just had goals, just saw the goal, the end result, and knew how much work it would take to get there and was willing to do it.''

Dr. Clark, 41, a Navy commander who was one of two women among the seven astronauts aboard the space shuttle Columbia, was always scuba diving or mountain biking, hiking or rock climbing or parachuting. She grew up in Racine, Wisc., the eldest of four children, married a fellow Navy officer, Jonathan Clark, who later joined her in working at NASA, and had an 8-year-old son, Iain.

In an e-mail message sent from the space shuttle a few days ago, Dr. Clark marveled at the view of Wind Point, a peninsula jutting into Lake Michigan a few miles from her childhood home, and wondered whether the photographs she had taken would turn out.

''Hello from above our magnificent planet earth,'' Dr. Clark wrote to a group of close friends and relatives. ''The perspective is truly awe-inspiring. Even the stars have a special brightness. I have seen my 'friend' Orion several times.''

An animal lover who was always the child to sleep with the family cat, Laurel Blair Salton graduated from Racine's William Horlick High School in 1979 and majored in zoology at the University of Wisconsin, in Madison, intending to be a veterinarian. Instead, she attended the university's medical school, where she was part of a tight-knit group of six friends who saved up their vacation time and spent the last three weeks before graduation in 1987 sailing a 42-foot boat through the British Virgin Islands.

After nearly a decade in the Navy, with postings in Pensacola, Fla., Holy Loch, Scotland, and Yuma, Ariz., a friend suggested that Dr. Clark take the NASA test. Like many others, she was not accepted on the first round. She later became part of a class known as the Sardines, because it had more than 40 astronaut candidates, the most in history, Mr. Salton said.

At NASA, Dr. Clark was nicknamed ''Floral,'' because of the vibrant colors that she wore when not in uniform.

Mr. Salton said he never worried about the safety of the shuttle -- until two weeks ago, when he joined his mother, siblings and several of Dr. Clark's friends at the launching.

''I was just an emotional wreck when she was in space, when you actually see that rocket go up,'' he recalled. ''Visions of the Challenger go through your head and you pray that it's not going to happen. Once they're up in space, big sigh of relief, O.K., the dangerous part is over. I never even considered that something could happen on the way down.''

While in space, Dr. Clark was part of several life-science experiments. In an interview from space published on Friday in The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, she spoke of watching the sunsets.

''There's a flash -- the whole payload bay turns this rosy pink,'' she said. ''It only lasts about 15 seconds and then it's gone. It's very ethereal and extremely beautiful.''

Always a lover of her Scottish heritage, Dr. Clark had chosen as her wake-up song aboard the shuttle a bagpipe version of ''Amazing Grace,'' similar to one played at her wedding.

It will also be played at her funeral.

LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE: THE ASTRONAUTS

	At Dawn, the Columbia


In the dark before dawn Friday morning, 24 hours prior to Columbia's re-entering the earth's atmosphere, I went outside to see if I could catch sight of it. Fog hung over the bay, obscuring all but a few stars. I had almost given up when the shuttle suddenly appeared, gliding across a black lagoon of clear sky between two cloudbanks. It didn't look like much -- a yellowish dot of light, wavering in the turbid air like a lantern on the stern of a receding square-rigger, bustling eastward with appointments to keep. But as I watched it vanish behind the clouds, I found myself thinking about the seven astronauts aboard.

Like many Americans, I hadn't been paying much attention to these particular astronauts. Then, on the Internet last Thursday, I happened across one of their live broadcasts from space, and wound up watching them for hours on the computer screen. They demonstrated how they ate their favorite foods in the weightless environment (carefully, to prevent crumbs floating around), wryly displayed the frozen blood samples they were bringing back for laboratory analysis on the ground, and cavorted in weightlessness as delightedly as otters on ice.

There was something touching about the modest, almost intimate scale of the science experiments they conducted in the shuttle's lofty laboratory. They ignited balls of fire in a retort to study combustion in their weightless (technically, ''microgravity'') environment. They carried out ''spiders in space'' and ''ants in space'' tests designed by high school students. Mission specialist Laurel Clark, of Racine, Wis., whose gentle, effervescent demeanor seemed at odds with her credentials as a Navy Seals diver and flight surgeon, reported happily that a moth she was scrutinizing ''was just starting to pump its wings up.''

''Life continues in lots of places,'' she reflected, ''and life is a magical thing.''

I grew fond of them. Perhaps that's what brought me out on my widow's walk Friday. On Saturday morning I was up again, hoping to see them re-entering the atmosphere. A shuttle re-entry can be an awesome sight, a stark white contrail drawn across the sky like a fragment of titanic poetry. Television pictures don't prepare you for the enormity of the spectacle, the size of the proscenium within which the drama of spaceflight is played. I'd seen two of them, and was hoping for a third -- especially as I'd got to know a bit about the crew.

But the sky was covered by slate-gray clouds. I listened for the shuttle's double sonic boom but heard nothing. Back in bed I thought, they'll be home by now, and fell asleep. An hour later the phone started ringing.

Watching the shuttle go over can make you feel like a savage seeing a ship. It's not terribly far away, typically less than 200 miles high. As Isaac Asimov used to say, you could drive the family car to space in an afternoon, if the car could go straight up. Yet, it's in space. The shuttle astronauts see Earth as it is, just one small planet. They see the atmosphere for what it is, a fragile membrane no thicker, relative to the planet, than the skein of tears that a blink bestows on the eye. And they float, weightless, like fish in the sea or an embryo in the womb. They may be ''coasting,'' like the mariners of old who cautiously kept within sight of land, but the transition they are making could prove to be as epochal as the one that transpired when life first ventured out of the oceans onto land.

Watching the shuttle's customarily perfect skywriting sprawl into deadly chaos on the TV screen, I found myself thinking about those first amphibians and of what they left behind. Up until then, nearly every form of life in this world lived and died in the weightlessness of aquatic buoyancy. (That's how astronauts practice spacewalking today, by donning their spacesuits and climbing into an enormous swimming pool.) Then a few gave up their submarine freedom to labor in the weighty world above.

In a sense, each of us humans recapitulates this ancient transition. We start life afloat, weightless, in the womb, and then are delivered into a world of heaviness and toil. Ilan Ramon, the Israeli astronaut on Columbia, said in an interview from orbit that he liked it so much up there that he never wanted to come back. Other spacefarers have said the same thing. Possibly the appeal of weightlessness harbors a species of remembrance.

Which could explain, if dreams have explanations, a dream I had years ago. I'd applied to fly on the shuttle as part of the ''Journalist in Space'' program, which NASA canceled following the Challenger crash of 1986. One night I dreamed that we were completing a shuttle mission when something went wrong during re-entry. Instead of descending to Earth we skipped off the top of the atmosphere and were flung into space, never to return.

As the red clouds of dawn fell away beneath us I turned to the terrified astronaut sitting next to me and said: ''It's all right. It's O.K. We're going home.''

	Lacking Hard Data, Theorists Try Democracy


Science is not done by popular vote. But nothing can be taken for granted when string theory is the subject.

So when Stephen Shenker, a Stanford University theorist who was moderating a panel discussion here on the future of the putative theory of everything, asked for a show of hands on the fate of a strange number known as the cosmological constant, some 400 physicists and mathematicians were happy to swallow their doubts and vote.

The panel discussion, titled ''The Next Superstring Revolution,'' took place at Strings05, the latest yearly congress of string theorists, held in mid-July at the University of Toronto. That it was a somewhat unusual occasion was not lost on anyone. No other field of science, said Jacques Distler, from the University of Texas, would be presumptuous enough to have a meeting about its next revolution.

But then no other field of science is like string theory, which says that nature with all its forces and particles is composed of tiny strings wriggling in 10 dimensions. In the last two decades it has taken academia by storm, and it has been rocked by periodic reinventions.

The first happened in 1984 when it was shown that a consistent theory of all the forces of nature could be constructed from strings. The second occurred in 1995 when relationships between the five different kinds of string theory suggested that they were all separate manifestations of a single underlying 11-dimensional theory known as M-theory.

As a result, string theory conferences have often been the scene of drama and, one year, even dancing and singing, when new developments rocketed the field into new dimensions of their mathematical wonderland.

But despite success in formulating a mathematically consistent theory that unifies gravity and the rest of nature, a goal that eluded Einstein, progress has stalled on other fronts, like going beyond consistency to proving that string theory is actually right. One problem is that ''stringy'' effects manifest themselves only at energies orders of magnitudes beyond the capabilities of any particle accelerator that could be built on Earth, meaning that the theory cannot be tested or guided by experiment.

''We've done very well for the last 20 years without any experimental input,'' said Michael Douglas of Rutgers.

Some string theorists (there are no string experimentalists) hope they might get some help soon. In 26 months, the most powerful particle accelerator ever built, the Large Hadron Collider, or L.H.C., will begin colliding protons with energies of seven trillion electron volts apiece at CERN in Geneva.

One long shot is that the accelerator will find evidence of particles disappearing into the extra dimensions demanded by string theory, which Dr. Douglas said would be ''one of the great triumphs of human history.''

Nima Arkani-Hamed, a Harvard physicist, called the Large Hadron Collider ''an unprecedented opportunity for discovering new physics.''

But, he said in a talk here, there is a problem. What physicists most expect to discover with the Large Hadron Collider is a new phenomenon called supersymmetry (which would manifest itself as a passel of new particles). Supersymmetry is predicted by string theory but alas is not exclusive to it. In fact there are tens of thousands of different models of supersymmetry, he said, so many that physicists will have trouble figuring out which one is right from a given set of data.

To dramatize the problem, Dr. Arkani-Hamed and others have prepared a simulated set of data from the collider and challenged their colleagues, in what they have dubbed the L.H.C. Olympics, to figure out what it means. For those who want to play, more information is available on the Web site http://wwwth.cern.ch/lhcOlympics/lhcolympics.html.

The panel discussion on the next revolution attracted a full, if somewhat dubious crowd. One of the panelists, Eva Silverstein of Stanford, joked when her time came that her friends in high-energy physics were amused ''when we sit around and tell about our feelings.''

Dr. Shenker, a Stanford theorist who has tousled blond hair going gray, was drafted as moderator by the organizers, so the joke went, because he ''was not only respected, but feared.'' He had recruited his panel with an accent on youth, on the ground that the progenitors of the previous revolutions were unlikely to be the makers of the next.

Dr. Shenker began by reminding those present that the grist for previous revolutions had come from ideas that had been overlooked. ''So it's a good bet,'' he told the crowd to much laughter, that the next revolution would be based on ideas ''that are being ignored or dismissed by you.''

One of those ideas, he noted, which has hardly been overlooked in debates in recent years, is what string theorists call ''the landscape,'' a sort of meta-universe of gazillions of possible solutions -- at least 10500 -- of the string theory equations. Since that's enough different universes for string theory to predict just about anything, it raises the question of how such flexibility can be tested.

But some theorists have suggested this abundance might be a way of explaining the bafflingly small value of the cosmological constant, a force that seems to be accelerating the expansion of the universe. Theoretical calculations suggest it should be 1060 times larger than what astronomers have measured. With so many possible universes available, theorists say, perhaps there is a random distribution of values of this constant and we simply live in a part of this meta-environment that works for us, like krill thriving in cold water.

''If environment selection proves correct, it would be a real revolution,'' Dr. Shenker said, ''and we will look back and say the third superstring revolution was five years early.''

But this kind of thinking -- often known as the anthropic principle -- is anathema to many scientists and nonscientists alike because it seems to place humanity at the center of the universe. Many physicists say it is a cop-out. Science, they contend, should eventually be able to calculate the fundamental characteristics of the universe from first principles. The controversy is often characterized as and East Coast-West Coast split, or even a Princeton-Stanford one.

In a conversation here, Michael Green of Cambridge University, one of string theory's founders, said that if the cosmological constant could be decided in such willy-nilly fashion it wasn't a fundamental aspect of physics and in the deeper long run was of little interest, never mind that it determines the fate of our own universe.

And so the panelists were happy to share their feelings about the anthropic principle.

Joseph Polchinski, a string theorist at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, Calif., suggested that the next revolution had already happened and it was indeed the anthropic principle.

But Nathan Seiberg, from Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, said, ''We will understand the universe and it will not involve the anthropic principle.'' This, he admitted was a conservative view, even though, as he noted, ''I come from a blue state.''

Andrew Strominger of Harvard deplored what he felt was an attitude of pessimism. String theory, he said, was not all of physics, but it was a very interesting and dazzling part of it. There are lots of problems, he said, but there is no obstacle in principle to solving them, which he described as ''a big intellectual adventure we all get to go through in the next few decades.''

String theory, he said, would eventually become an experimental science. There will be things out of left field. ''Sooner or later we will get there,'' Dr. Strominger said, ''and when we do we'll all be heroes.''

Dr. Shenker then opened the floor to the audience members, not all of whom agreed that string theorists were yet heroes.

Lee Smolin, of the nearby Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, which helped sponsor the meeting, and who works on an alternative quantum gravity theory known as loop quantum gravity, chided the string theorists for their failure to come up with a version of their theory in which the strings make space and time instead of merely wriggling around in space and time. Such a so-called background independent formulation, he said, was Einstein's goal for the invention of general relativity.

''I'm not sure it will be the next revolution,'' Dr. Smolin said, ''but I am sure it will be the last.''

Edward Witten, one of the string theory leaders, cautioned against having too many preconceptions about the future, saying that a discussion like the present one would not have anticipated many of the most recent advances in string theory.

Many physicists indeed compared their plight to the situation in physics in the early decades of the 20th century between 1905, when Albert Einstein concluded that atoms and light waves strangely appear to exchange energy only in quantized bits, and 1925, when Werner Heisenberg's quantum mechanics overthrew common sense and cause and effect, at least as they applied on the atomic level.

''We haven't done as well in the last 20 years,'' Dr. Shenker said.

Leonard Susskind, a Stanford theorist and one of the founders of string theory, replied, ''There's nothing to do but just hope the Bush administration will keep paying us.''

Amanda Peet of the University of Toronto suggested making string theory ''a faith-based initiative,'' to much nervous laughter.

Repeating his call to optimism, Dr. Strominger said the work would go on. Not everybody needs to be a string theorist or even to agree with it.

''We have a need to understand the truth about the mathematical structure of string theory and of our universe,'' he said. ''Those who want to join us can, those who don't don't have to.''

''I don't see any need for pessimism or cause to sell ourselves,'' he concluded to applause.

At the end Dr. Shenker invoked his executive privileges. He asked the audience members for a vote on whether, by the year 3000, say, the value of the cosmological constant would be explained by the anthropic principle or by fundamental physics.

The panel split 4 to 4, with abstentions, but the audience voted overwhelmingly for the latter possibility.

''Wow,'' exhaled one of the panel members amid other exclamations too colorful to print here.

''The anthropic principle is out of office,'' somebody else said.

Dr. Shenker concluded, ''We have made some progress in sharing our feelings.''

	One Cosmic Question, Too Many Answers


Call it the theory of anything.

Einstein once wondered aloud whether ''God had any choice'' in creating the universe. It was his fondest hope that the answer was no.

He and subsequent generations of physicists have hoped that at the end of their labors there would be one answer -- a so-called Theory of Everything -- that would explain why the details of the world are the way they are and cannot be any other way: why there was a Big Bang, the number of dimensions of space-time, the masses of elementary particles.

For 20 years, physicists have lodged those hopes in string theory, a mathematically labyrinthian effort to portray nature as made up of tiny wriggling strings and membranes, rather than pointlike particles or waves.

Once called a piece of 21st-century physics that had fallen into the 20th century by accident, string theory has become one of the hippest fields of science, celebrated in books like the recent best seller ''The Elegant Universe,'' by the Columbia theorist Brian Greene, and the subject of a miniseries on ''Nova,'' coming this fall.

In principle, strings can unite all the forces of nature, including gravity, in a single mathematical framework. But the ''stringiness'' of nature manifests itself only at energies and temperatures that can be generated in a particle accelerator the size of a small galaxy.

As a result, physicists have been left at the mercy of their mathematical imaginations or sifting cosmological data for hints of a clue from God's own particle accelerator, the Big Bang.

The hope was that when all was said and done, there would be only one solution to the theory's tangled equations, one answer corresponding to only one possible universe. But recent progress in string theory paradoxically seems to leave physics further than ever from that dream of a unique answer. Instead of a single answer, the equations of string theory seem to have so many solutions, millions upon millions of them, each describing a logically possible universe, that it may be impossible to tell which one describes our own.

In a series of conceptual and technical breakthroughs, a group of theorists at Stanford showed this year that string theory could describe a universe whose expansion was accelerating -- something that many experts thought impossible.

That was no small accomplishment because cosmologists now theorize that some puzzling and so far unidentified ''dark energy'' is wrenching space apart ever more violently. This energy seems to make up 70 percent of the cosmos, according to astronomical observations.

The new calculations suggest that this dark energy cannot last forever, that it will disappear sometime in the far future, according to the researchers, Dr. Shamit Kachru, Dr. Renata Kallosh and Dr. Andrei Linde, all of Stanford, and Dr. Sandip P. Trivedi of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay.

But the same calculations confirmed that string theory could have a vast number of solutions, each representing a different universe with slightly different laws of physics. The detailed characteristics of any particular one of these universes -- the laws that describe the basic forces and particles -- might be decided by chance.

As a result, string theorists and cosmologists are confronted with what Dr. Leonard Susskind of Stanford has called ''the cosmic landscape,'' a sort of metarealm of space-times. Contrary to Einstein's hopes, it may be that neither God nor physics chooses among these possibilities, Dr. Susskind contends. Rather it could be life.

Only a fraction of the universes in this metarealm would have the lucky blend of properties suitable for life, Dr. Susskind explained. It should be no surprise that we find ourselves in one of these.

''We live where we can live,'' he said.

Dr. Susskind conceded that many colleagues who harbor the Einsteinian dream of predicting everything are appalled by that notion that God plays dice with the laws of physics.

Among them is Dr. David Gross, director of the Kavli Institute of Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, Calif., who said, ''I'm a total Einsteinian with respect to the ultimate goal of science.''

Physicists should be able to predict all the parameters of nature, Dr. Gross said, adding, ''They're not adjustable.''

But Dr. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said, ''I think this grand dream is basically dying.''

Dr. Michael Douglas of Rutgers and the Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies, near Paris, called the plethora of string universes ''the Alice's Restaurant'' problem.

''You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant,'' he said. ''Is this a theory of something, very many things or nothing? That's what we're trying to establish.''

The Early Hopes  Not Particles, But Strings

The question of whether strings will provide a unique answer to the universe has been hanging over physicists' heads ever since the modern form of string theory made its triumphal emergence in 1984. That year, Dr. John Schwarz of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Michael Green, now of Cambridge University in England, showed that thinking of elementary particles as little strings instead of points eliminated troublesome mathematical anomalies from theories that sought to combine gravity with subatomic physics.

Even Einstein had failed to unite those disparate and mathematically incompatible realms. But the 1984 calculation raised the hope that physicists had finally found the key to the so-called Theory of Everything.

''There was this wild enthusiasm, unbridled enthusiasm, that we paid for later,'' said Dr. Andrew Strominger, a professor of physics at Harvard.

In 1985, Dr. Strominger, Dr. Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, Dr. Gary T. Horowitz, now at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Dr. Philip Candelas, now at the University of Texas, published a classic paper showing that it was possible to construct a string theory consistent with the so-called Standard Model that describes particles and forces in our four-dimensional universe.

One problem is that string theory requires 10 dimensions of space-time, whereas we appear to live in four. Dr. Strominger remembered being excited when he found a paper by the mathematician Dr. Shing-Tung Yau, now of Harvard and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. It proved a conjecture by Dr. Eugenio Calabi, now retired from the University of Pennsylvania, that the extra dimensions could be curled up in microscopically invisible ways like the loops in a carpet.

The paper described only one way this folding could be done. But Dr. Yau soon told the physicists that there were thousands of what are now called Calabi-Yau spaces, each one representing a different solution of the string equations. By the time their paper was finished, ''the uniqueness of string theory was certainly already in question,'' Dr. Strominger said.

That was just the beginning. For each of the thousands of ways of curling the extra dimensions into Calabi-Yau spaces, there were hundreds of variations in details like the sizes of the loops and the way electrical and magnetic fields thread through them. When the variations are taken into account, the number of solutions and the number of possible universes can easily exceed 10 100.

The Challenge  A Universe Unfit For Life or Physics?

This bounty of possibilities makes it extremely daunting for scientists who want to test string theory by comparing its predictions to the real world. One telltale clue to the right answer, as well as a huge challenge, developed five years ago when astronomers discovered that the expansion of the universe was apparently accelerating. But until recently, many theorists doubted that strings could produce even one example of an accelerating universe.

The reason is that the leading explanation for this behavior is a cosmic repulsion, known as the cosmological constant, that results from the properties of empty space itself.

It was first invented by Einstein in 1917 as a fudge factor to stabilize the universe and then abandoned by him when astronomers found out that the universe was not static, but expanding.

If Einstein's fudge factor is real after all, the universe will continue to expand faster and faster as space grows bigger and bigger, producing more and more repulsion.

String theorists did not know how to deal with the cosmological constant. According to quantum mechanics, the weird laws that govern subatomic physics, empty space should be foaming with energy and particles that wink in and out of existence, and their collective effect could produce a repulsive force like Einstein's constant. But the calculations also suggest that this force should be some 1060  times what astronomers have measured; it would have blown the universe apart in its first millisecond, long before atoms, galaxies or humans could form.

Moreover, a permanently accelerating universe would present deep conceptual problems, several physicists pointed out, including Dr. Thomas Banks of Rutgers and the University of California at Santa Cruz, Dr. Willy Fischler of the University of Texas, Dr. Susskind and Dr. Witten.

Such a universe would slowly empty itself of energy and information because most of the galaxies would eventually be flying away so fast that humans could not see them. The observable universe would actually shrink, as if surrounded by a black hole. Life would become impossible, and the usual methods of formulating physics might not apply.

As a result of such arguments, it was widely presumed that a universe that accelerated forever -- that is, one with a cosmological constant -- was incompatible with string theory, Dr. Kachru of Stanford said.

It was partly to counter such claims, he added, that he and his colleagues were motivated to look for the cosmological constant in the gazillions of possible string universes.

The Hitch  A Breakthrough, But a Bleak One

Last winter, Dr. Kachru and his colleagues succeeded in using string theory to construct universes that accelerated, but with a surprising twist.

The hitch, in each case, was that the acceleration would be only temporary. It might last an extremely long time, but eventually the dark energy of the cosmological constant would melt away, decaying just in time to avoid the problems of permanent acceleration that string theorists have worried about. The universe would then coast for the rest of eternity.

The work followed on previous work by Dr. Kachru with Dr. Joseph Polchinski of the Santa Barbara Institute and Dr. Steven Giddings of the University of California at Santa Barbara, and by Dr. Polchinski and Dr. Raphael Bousso of the University of California at Berkeley.

Part of the reason dark energy decays, explained Dr. Linde of Stanford, is that these solutions describe the four-dimensional universe we observe around us -- three dimensions of space and one of time -- with the other six curled up so tightly that they cannot provide closet space. But it takes energy to keep the extra dimensions confined.

''In the long run,'' he said, ''the universe doesn't want to be four-dimensional. It wants to be 10 dimensions.''

So sooner or later, the loops will unravel like a tangle of rubber bands, passing through a succession of configurations that take less and less energy to maintain, until finally the other dimensions expand and the cosmological constant is gone.

The decay of the cosmological constant will be fatal, astronomers agree. At that moment a bubble of 10-dimensional space will sweep out at the speed of light, rearranging physics and the prospects of atoms and planets, not to mention biological creatures.

''What it leaves behind,'' Dr. Susskind said, ''it's hard to say. Almost certainly not a livable universe.''

The Role of Luck  A Controversial Idea Returns to Stage

The universe is certainly livable now, but why has long been a vexing and polarizing issue. Life as We Know It seems to require an almost miraculous juggling of a few atomic and astronomical parameters.

Was the universe designed for us? Or did we just get lucky?

Searching for answers, some theorists have invoked the so-called anthropic principle, which states that our universe has to have laws suitable for life. Otherwise we would not be here to see it. The apparent ''fine-tuning'' of this universe is simply an artifact of our own existence here as observers, Dr. Brandon Carter, now at the Paris Observatory in Meudon, argued in 1974.

The principle fits well with recent theories of the Big Bang that suggest that the universe seen through telescopes is just one in an endless chain of bubble universes that sprout from one another.

If there is just one universe, the fact that it suits us would seem suspiciously lucky. But if there are many universes to choose from, our existence is less miraculous.

It might be the diversity of string-theory universes that gives this metacosmos a chance at harboring life, Dr. Susskind says.

He likes to portray it as a mountain range, the ''cosmic landscape,'' in which the height of the peaks represents the energy or the cosmological constant of that configuration. The universe is like water rolling around the hills, always seeking a lower state. There are valleys and basins and plateaus where it can rest. But it can spread, plopping like a wave sloshing over the hills from valley to valley, from one configuration of dimensions and fields to another.

As a result, he said, in whatever form it starts, the universe will branch out into other forms. If it keeps sloshing, it will eventually land in a valley with the lucky mix of cosmic constants that allows for galaxies and carbon-based chemistry somewhere. If a small fraction of the subuniverses can support life, then there is a good chance that life will arise somewhere, Dr. Susskind explained.

Others caution, however, that it has not been proved that different classes of universes would be so interconnected. ''It could be that there are many disconnected landscapes,'' explained Dr. Douglas of Rutgers.

Dr. Susskind said that ''whether we like it or not,'' the new findings gave further credence to the anthropic principle and a mathematical framework for how it might work.

But such ''anthropic thinking'' is defeatist to many physicists. ''We see this kind of thing happen over and over again as a reaction to difficult problems,'' Dr. Gross said. ''Come up with a grand principle that explains why you're unable to solve the problem.''

The notion that some problems are unsolvable is discouraging to the younger generation, he said, pointing out that nobody even knows what the final form of string theory will be.

Dr. Witten said he also disliked the anthropic principle. ''I continue to hope that we are overlooking or misunderstanding something and that there is ultimately a more unique answer,'' he wrote by e-mail.

Dr. Susskind conceded that he had once been on the other side of the question.

''I've had myself jerked around by this theory,'' he said. ''When you have to give up your fondest dream for what the theory would do'' -- a reference to the quest for a unique answer -- ''that's a hard thing to swallow.''

The Future  Still Listening For Orderly Music

Dr. Strominger of Harvard said the debate on anthropic principle was indicative of the ''all-or-nothing psychology'' of string theory.

''It's not enough to solve some problems,'' he said. ''It has to solve every problem.''

Theorists have long hoped that all but one of these solutions will eliminate themselves through some mathematical inconsistency or failure to reproduce an essential feature of the universe like the cosmological constant. Dr. Douglas of Rutgers has challenged that hope, saying string theory may have so many solutions that physical measurements can not distinguish among them.

Indeed, he pointed out in a recent paper, it has not been proved that string theory does not have an infinite number of solutions. So far, anything seems possible.

Rather than sifting myriad solutions for the one that fits our universe, Dr. Douglas has developed statistical methods to analyze the set of string solutions as a whole to find patterns that will not show up when the solutions are examined one by one.

The results could help ascertain which features of this ''zoo of possibilities'' are more common and which are more rare, and how many solutions really are too many.

''My own philosophy,'' Dr. Douglas said in an interview, ''is that we should do our best to listen to what string theory is trying to tell us. It is smarter than we are.''

Dr. Kachru suggested that it might be wishful thinking to expect that a ''smoking gun'' confirmation of string theory could be found from comparing it to today's universe. The full glories of string theory, he said, manifest themselves only at energies trillions of times what earthbound particle accelerators can produce.

Perhaps, he said, theorists should be looking for the smoking gun in the Big Bang.

Asked what the smoking-gun question might be, Dr. Kachru laughed and said, ''If I knew, I would be working in that field.''

	A Practical Way to Make Power From Wasted Heat


Scientists at M.I.T. and a small company in Salt Lake City are scheduled to announce today that they have developed technology that can efficiently and inexpensively transform heat pollution into electricity.

Although only a few crude samples have been built, Dr. Yan Kucherov, director of research and development at the Salt Lake City company, Eneco Inc., and Dr. Peter L. Hagelstein, professor of electrical engineering at M.I.T. and a technical consultant at Eneco, say that their devices improve the efficiency of the conversion by more than half.

''It's really first-generation, very primitive implementation,'' Dr. Hagelstein said. ''Potentially, it's an enormous deal. This opens a door.''

While the heat generated by car engines and power plants usually does nothing but warm the surrounding air, scientists have long dreamed of building so-called thermoelectric devices that can capture the wasted heat and convert a portion of it into electricity.

Such devices could significantly increase the electrical output of existing power plants or power the electrical systems of automobiles, replacing alternators and increasing gas mileage.

The Pentagon, which partly financed the new research, has been interested in using the devices for silent motors. Operating in reverse, thermoelectric devices can also be used as refrigerators.

Another advantage of thermoelectric devices is that they produce electricity without generating additional pollution.

Current thermoelectric technology converts only about 10 percent of the heat it absorbs into electricity, too inefficient a return for widespread use. The new devices, however, reach about 17 percent, and Dr. Hagelstein said future devices should be able to improve upon that significantly.

It is impossible to transform 100 percent of the heat into electricity. The laws of physics dictate a theoretical maximum of about 50 percent at the temperature a thermoelectric device operates at. Current commercial thermoelectric devices, at 10 percent efficiency, get only one-fifth the maximum. Using the new technology, future devices should be able to achieve more than half the maximum.

The researchers are presenting their findings at a meeting of the Materials Research Society in Boston. Scientific papers describing the experiments have been submitted to the journals Physical Review Letters and Applied Physics Letters.

If borne out, the findings would be significant, said Dr. George S. Nolas, a professor of physics at the University of South Florida and an organizer of a symposium about thermoelectric devices at the Materials Research Society meeting. Dr. Nolas had not seen the Eneco paper but said the reported efficiency was high enough to find practical use and ''would be pretty good news.''

Eneco's thermoelectric device is a sandwich of three layers of semiconductor. One outer layer is heated; the other is kept at room temperature. The middle layer acts as an insulator to maintain the temperature difference.

The heat causes electrons to shoot out, some crossing the sandwich to generate an electrical current. The Eneco researchers added impurities -- a process called doping -- to the heated layer to increase the flow of electrons.

''The region near the hot part is heavily doped, so it boils off electrons,'' Dr. Hagelstein said. ''We get more voltage and more current.''

He added: ''The underlying technology is really very simple. It should be a very practical, relatively cheap technology.''

Leroy Becker, marketing director of Eneco, which is not associated with the Dutch utility Eneco Energie, said the company hoped to produce a prototype of a practical device within a year and sell it within two years.

Eneco, a privately held company, was created in 1991 to seek to license patents on cold fusion after the controversial claim of two University of Utah scientists that they could produce almost limitless amounts of energy in a room-temperature flask of water. Eneco also financed follow-up research on cold fusion, including work by Dr. Hagelstein. The claims for cold fusion were far overstated, and several years ago, Eneco shifted its focus to thermoelectric devices.

	Conservation-Mindful Bush Turns to Energy Research


As President Bush toured the Energy Department today and sent Congress an outline of his program to meet America's hunger for gasoline and electricity, something unexpected cropped up: a presidential proposal for nearly $300 million to finance Clinton-era research programs on energy conservation, money that the administration struck from the budget earlier this year.

The proposal to restore the research money followed a series of polls showing that Americans believed that Mr. Bush's energy plans were primarily about helping oil companies and drilling in the Arctic  rather than energy savings.

The White House maintained that polls had nothing to do with Mr. Bush's decision and that instead a ''preliminary review'' by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham showed that the research programs, on energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy, ''may be supportive of the president's objectives.''

Mr. Bush used his visit to the Energy Department today to talk extensively about conservation, a topic to which he has turned with increasing frequency. That focus runs contrary to earlier dismissive references by Vice President Dick Cheney, who previously suggested that while conservation was a sign of ''personal virtue,'' it did not constitute an energy strategy.

In addition to the research funds, Mr. Bush today called for federal and corporate work on small devices called ''vampire slayers'' that could cut the power consumption of appliances that constantly draw electricity as they await use -- copiers, fax machines, cell-phone chargers and the like.

''Vampire devices use about 4 percent of the electricity in the average home,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And to put this on a national scale, if we multiplied the vampire devices' energy consumption across the country, we're talking about 52 billion kilowatt-hours of power a year, or the equivalent of 26 average-size power plants.''

Environmental groups said Mr. Bush was neglecting conservation measures that could prove far more effective, like raising fuel-efficiency standards for cars. ''Everything he did on the standby-power problem is good, but it is comparatively small potatoes,'' said David Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, which has been lobbying for more conservation measures.

Both mileage standards and a restoring of the Clinton administration's proposals on air-conditioner efficiency, Mr. Nemtzow said, would save far more power than anything the president discussed today.

Senate and House Republicans, meanwhile, stepped up the pressure on Democrats to push Mr. Bush's long-term energy plan. They accused Democrats of delaying action on an energy bill for the sake of political gain and vowed to explain to voters in their districts during the Congressional recess next week the urgency of passing comprehensive legislation. The Republican effort over the recess -- complete with handouts, videos and talking points -- is being coordinated with the White House.

Hoping to prod the process on Capitol Hill, Mr. Bush sent Congress today his energy plan's broadly written legislative initiatives, dealing mostly with conservation (including the restored research money), modernizing and expanding pipelines and tramission lines, drilling for oil and  promoting nuclear energy. Many of the ideas are already addressed in Senate Republican energy legislation. The House is beginning work on a separate bill.

Republicans called on the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle of  South Dakota, to schedule floor debate on the legislation. For his part,  Mr. Daschle said the Democrats planned to begin committee hearings in July. ''It's a schedule that I think illustrates the degree to which we are taking the matter seriously,'' he said.

But Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who formerly headed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said of the Democrats: ''By refusing to take this matter up in a timely manner, they are setting a very dangerous precedent. Now I know they are playing politics. The longer they refuse, the more they can point out, 'Well, this is a Republican problem, it's the Republicans that aren't solving it.' ''

In pressing their message on energy, Republicans have tried to blunt the Democrats' political advantage on the issue. Taking Mr. Bush's lead, they are now quick to talk about conservation and protecting the environment before moving on to speak of a need for increased oil and gas production. Recent public opinion surveys find that voters prefer investing time and money in conservation and the search for cleaner-burning fuels than in drilling for more oil.

Like the Republicans, Democrats  expect to talk about energy during the recess; their emphasis will be on  the large campaign contributions that Republican leaders have received from the energy industry.

The president's energy plan ''is heavy on rhetoric and short on action,'' said Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader. ''He brings out a glossy paper book four weeks ago, and they seem to be doing the opposite of what's in the plan.''

	In Mandrill Society, Life is a Girl Thing


It was a moment when the sublime met the ridiculous, Jane Goodall by way of the Marx Brothers.

Kate Abernethy and her fellow primatologists were driving through the Lope Reserve of Gabon, in Central Africa, a gorgeous checkerboard mosaic of open savanna grassland and dense, galleried tropical rainforest. Suddenly they spied a group of mandrills crossing the road just a few yards in front of them, the distinctively colorful primates loping along in snappy single file.

In a flash, the scientists realized that the great monkey god had smiled on them, and that the military procession gave them a chance to get an accurate count of a mandrill group, something that, although the baboon-like creatures have been known about and admired for centuries, nobody had ever managed to do. Yanking out a hand-held video camera, the researchers started shooting, literally, from the hip. As the large, raucous battalion passed in front of her, Dr. Abernethy, of the International Center for Medical Research in Gabon, tried to quickly describe on the videotape the sex of each individual, and whether it was adult or juvenile.

''Female, female, female,'' she muttered, keeping her voice low so as not to frighten the monkeys. ''Juvenile, female, female, big male, big male, female.''

The mandrills kept crossing.

''Female, female, female, big male, female, female . . .''

Remember the classic scene in ''Night at the Opera,'' when people keep piling into Groucho's room, and just when you think it's stuffed beyond capacity, another guest pushes through the door?

''Female, female, female, juvenile, big male, female . . .''

Finally, Dr. Abernethy's immortal utterance (as heard on the video, which can be seen at the new Congo exhibit at the Bronx Zoo): ''Oh, forget it!'' And still the mandrills kept on coming . . .

''It was one of the most exciting experiences I'd ever had with primates in the wild,'' said Elizabeth Rogers of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who has worked at the Lope reserve periodically since 1984. ''The size of that group was really over the top, and there we were, filming it.''

The scientists' excitement only mounted when they replayed the tape and got the census they had sought: 604 mandrills, the largest aggregation of nonhuman primates ever observed. Nor was that particular mandrill group the most populous the scientists would encounter. In five years of rigorous study at Lope, the scientists have tallied hordes of 700, 800, up to 1,350.

Importantly, the primatologists have determined that the mandrill groups are extremely cohesive. Baboons are known to congregate while feeding in groups of maybe 150 individuals, but such crowds are fleeting, and will fission into their core social subunits of 30 or 40 animals once an area has been picked clean. By contrast, a group of 800 mandrills is a tightknit and stable society, traveling, foraging, breeding, playing, nuzzling and bickering together year after year. (The average mandrill lives for 15 years in the wild.)

It's like a movable version of Winesburg, Ohio -- with one big difference. In Sherwood Anderson's fictional community, as in nearly all primate societies, males are outstanding, if not always upstanding, members of the community.

But as Dr. Abernethy and her co-authors E. Jean Wickings and Lee J. T. White of the Wildlife Conservation Society describe in a new report that was presented last month at an ecology meeting in Orlando, and that will be published this year, the enduring mandrill social group consists almost entirely of females and their dependent offspring.

As astonished as the researchers were by the magnitude of a mandrill society, they have been equally surprised to discover that adult male mandrills interact with the group only when the females are in estrus, from June through early November. Once the breeding season is through, the males disappear, and spend the rest of the year in distinctly unsimian solitude. They don't even bother to form itinerant bachelor bands, as many male primates do. And should a male happen to spy a passing flock of females in the off-season, Curious George he ain't.

''He'll simply ignore them,'' Dr. Abernethy said in a telephone interview from Gabon, adding, ''Male mandrills don't invest in political relationships, as chimpanzees will. They don't establish long-term bonds with females. When they move into a group, at the beginning of a breeding season, they have to establish everything from scratch.''

Of the approximately 235 known species of primates, only the orangutan matches the male mandrill in its taste for the monkish life. The new findings overturn almost everything that has been said about the behavior and social life Mandrillus sphinx to date, and also call into question existing models of why primates form social groups.

''Everybody knew that mandrills were amazing animals, the type that gets featured by Disney,'' said Dr. John Oates, a zoologist and conservationist at Hunter College, referring to the mandrills' appearance in the animated blockbuster, ''The Lion King.''  But now mandrills turn out to be ''so amazing,'' he said, ''that all we can do is throw up our hands and speculate wildly about how they got to be the way they are.''

On a more somber note, the discoveries raise questions about the species' long-term prospects as a free-ranging creature. Conservationists are alarmed by how the recent rise in the so-called bush meat trade -- the hunting of wild animals in general and primates in particular -- might affect mandrill populations.

Because the new studies show that mandrills travel over unusually long distances in spectacularly large numbers, conservationists are concerned that the monkeys will be especially vulnerable to hunters using the ever-expanding network of logging roads to penetrate into forests that were once inaccessible to hunting. Some conservation organizations now rank the bush meat trade as the single greatest threat to primates and other wildlife, outstripping in severity even the familiar eco-villain, habitat loss.

''In case of species like mandrills, we have a real problem from hunting,'' said Dr. John G. Robinson, a vice president of Wildlife Conservation Society in the Bronx, which finances the mandrill project in Gabon. ''People like to eat them, they're very tasty, and they come in the right size. You can smoke them and transport them very easily. And because mandrills move in very large groups, they're pretty easy to find and to intercept, and to hunt in batches of 50, 100 or even more.''

At the moment, mandrills are classified as ''near-threatened,'' rather than ''endangered,'' but Dr. Robinson and his colleagues are taking steps while the numbers still offer hope for a creature that loves a crowd.

Among other things, the scientists are negotiating to expand the list of criteria that a logging company must meet if its wood is to be sanctioned as ''sustainable.'' By current practice, wood is certified as sustainable if a logging company cuts down only so many trees a year, avoids clear cutting and replants a certain percentage of what it takes.

The market for such environmentally correct wood is growing faster than you can say ''chain saw.'' Home Depot, the chain of home-improvement stores, has announced that it will buy sustainable wood whenever possible. Conservationists would like to append ''sensitivity to wildlife'' to the certification process, a stipulation that would impel logging companies to keep commercial hunters off their roads and away from the primate throngs.

That mandrills take group size to extremes is in keeping with the flamboyant creatures, which boast Guinness-type records in an array of categories. As Charles Darwin observed in 1871, the mandrill is the most vividly colored specimen in mammaldom, its lozenge-shaped muzzle of red and blue more like what you would expect on a bird than on the furred. The male gets gaudier still at sexual maturity, when his blue and red markings turn neon-bright and are further highlighted by the growth of dazzling white cheek ridges and a thick golden beard; and, just to be sure he is seen coming and going, his blue buttocks brighten as well.

At three feet in height and 90 pounds in weight, and with canine teeth the size of human thumbs, the adult male is the largest and most formidable of any monkey. Moreover, the sexual dimorphism, or size difference, between the male and the 25-pound female is among the most extreme in the primate order. Yet, though mandrills have been known about for centuries, prized as curiosities by potentates and long a favorite attraction in zoos, they have been little studied in the wilderness.

''They're extremely difficult to track when they're in the forest,'' Dr. Rogers explained.

Because mandrills look like Crayola versions of baboons, they were thought until recently to be close cousins of the Papio family, even members of it. Thus, mandrill society was usually described as baboonish in structure, composed of an alpha male and his dogged coterie of females. Some researchers suggested that the male mandrill's bright colors made it easier for him to lead ''his'' females through the forest.

Last year, however, a DNA study published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences revealed that mandrills are neither baboons nor their next of kin. Instead, mandrills turn out to be most closely related to mangebays, short-legged tree-dwelling monkeys. Now the research at Lope is showing that, behaviorally, mandrills are a class unto themselves.

In addition to using videocameras to record troops as they traverse openings in the forest, the researchers have also managed to put radio collars on a number of adult mandrills, an approach that revealed the loneliness of the off-season male.

By collecting thousands of scat samples, the scientists have learned much about mandrill diet. It turns out that mandrills are finicky omnivores. They eat a little bit of a lot of things -- nuts, leaves, insects, fruit, grass, fungi, small vertebrates. They pick and choose and throw a lot away in disgust. A species of nut that pleases them in one spot may repel them in the next. They travel constantly as they forage, covering three or five miles a day, far more than most primates travel. Their home range is accordingly huge, 115 square miles or so, the largest such range known for any primate.

The researchers have also learned how violent a male's life can be.

''Of the six males that we collared, only one had all its canines intact,'' Dr. Abernethy said. ''All the rest had broken teeth, scars on the face, ripped nostrils up to the eye. One had such severe fresh puncture wounds that we could see the cartilage. We couldn't collar him, and I don't know if he survived after we let him go.'' The males get these wounds in violent battles with one another during mating season.

As it turns out, the males do not have much time to make their reproductive mark. They do not have harems, after all, and they cannot very well monopolize a female society numbering 800 strong.

Once females start coming into estrus, males from all around descend on the group. The males start grunting, panting, heaving noisily from the chest hour upon hour. They are so big, colorful, loud and impossible to ignore. They fight, yes, and they suffer from the lacerating canines of their competitors, but the primatologists propose that the males would suffer even greater damage if not for their dramatic appearance.

''Having seen the risks they take during actual fights,'' Dr. Abernethy said, ''I'd suspect that the incredible investment they make in color and auditory signaling is an attempt to minimize that risk.'' In other words, a male in his fully pigmented and baritone glory is trying to get the attention of at least some females as quickly as possible, before a rival suitor decides to go for his throat.

The researchers do not yet understand the why mandrill societies have evolved as they have. They do not know why so many females stick together, and they are just starting to do the studies to see whether all the females in a given troop are related.

Does large group size protect the female, and if so, from whom? Perhaps from predators, or perhaps from mandrill males. Whereas female baboons often display the wounds of the alpha males that seek to control them, female mandrills do not seem to be the recipients of mate abuse, despite the male's vastly superior size.

Can mandrills find safety in numbers should human hunters come to call? Don't bet a buffalo nickel on it.

	In Spiders, Itsy Bitsy Gets the Girl


In the battle for mates, it is the largest males of the animal kingdom that tend to dominate, facing down competitors with their towering height and great girth. But scientists have discovered one battle that conveys the advantage to the teeny-tiny male: the battle with gravity.

Scientists at the University of Kentucky have provided one of the best explanations yet for the astonishingly small size of some males. It is a question that has puzzled researchers, including Darwin, for more than a century.

The higher up the female spiders spin their webs, the researchers say, the greater the heights the males must scale to reach them, and the smaller these fellows tend to be.

''If you're small, you climb better,'' said Dr. Jordi Moya-Laraño, a spider ecologist at Kentucky who was the lead author of the new study. The idea is simple. The less weight one has to haul along on a climb, the easier and quicker it is.

The research was published in a recent issue of the Evolution in an article titled ''Climbing to Reach Females: Romeo Should Be Small.''

Researchers who were not involved with the study called the so-called gravity hypothesis a creative answer to this peculiarly spider-centric puzzle. While males in other groups can be dwarfed by their females, female spiders often heavily outweigh their mates. In fact, Dr. Moya-Laraño said spiders exhibited the most radical size differences between the sexes of any land animals, with females sometimes weighing 100 times as much as their males.

Dr. Maydianne Andrade, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Toronto at Scarborough, noted that the hypothesis was not necessarily limited to spiders, and might also explain other small males, including tiny male insects that perform airborne acrobatics during courtship and might maneuver more easily because they are small.

To test the gravity hypothesis, Dr. Moya-Laraño and colleagues compared the life patterns and sizes of 112 species of spiders.

They found that if females made their webs or prowled about on the ground, a huge, lumbering male appeared to be at little disadvantage. But the higher the females lived, in shrubs or up in the trees, the smaller, relatively, males tended to be. And the bigger the species -- meaning the more weight a male would have to drag skyward -- the more drastically males appeared to have become diminished relative to their gargantuan mates.

But, researchers noted, it is likely that other forces are also helping to exaggerate the difference in sizes between the spider sexes. In some cases, it may be more a matter of gigantism in females that need to be large to produce a bounty of eggs, than dwarfism in males. And gravity aside, spider males may find great benefits in being negligibly small, particularly those males that must seduce hungry females waiting to pounce on intruders at the web.

Noting the vast number of cannibalistic spider species, Dr. Andrade said: ''The risk is that the female will consume you before you mate. Small spiders can dance across the web without the female detecting their vibrations.''

Understandably, spider suitors can be quite tentative in their approach and, scientists who have seen the carnage, can find themselves squeamish. Darwin himself once noted how a male spider ''in the midst of his preparatory caresses was seized by the object of his attractions, enveloped by her in a web and then devoured.''

	Scientists Find Way to Gauge Earth's Glow


The eerie glow of earthshine -- sunlight bouncing off Earth and striking the Moon -- makes the dark part of the Moon's disk just barely visible to the naked eye. Now a team of astronomers and physicists has done what the eye cannot. They have detected slight variations in the glow, in effect, variations in how much sunlight Earth reflects hour by hour, season to season and year to year.

They say the results lend tenuous support to a highly controversial theory that Earth is cloudier, and therefore reflects more sunlight, when the Sun is near the minimum of its 11-year activity cycle and has the fewest sunspots and solar storms.

Other scientists are praising the researchers' technique, which they say may one day be useful in studies of climate. But they dismiss the  early conclusions as little more than moonshine. These critics say they fear the findings will give support to critics of the idea that greenhouse gases cause global warming.

But the team of researchers, who made their observations at Big Bear Observatory in California and who will report their findings in the May 1 issue of Geophysical Research Letters, say they are simply turning to earthshine as a way of sharpening scientists' knowledge of how much solar radiation Earth reflects.

''If you think about what drives our climate, it's the net sunshine that reaches us,'' said Dr. Philip R. Goode, the leader of the research and the director of Big Bear, which is owned by the New Jersey Institute of Technology. ''That depends on the sun's output and how much the mirror of the Earth reflects.''

Earth's overall reflectivity, or albedo, depends almost entirely on cloud cover and is difficult to measure with any certainty using satellites, said Dr. Loren Acton, a solar physicist at Montana State University who was not involved in the research. He said satellites were often too close to see the big picture.

Using earthshine is ''pretty straightforward and pretty clever,'' Dr. Acton said.

But Dr. Stephen H. Schneider, a Stanford climatologist, said it was ''very unlikely'' that solar activity could replace greenhouse gases as the likely cause of global warming.

The new measurements, which used a small telescope outfitted with an electronic camera, were made over about seven years.The observations resurrected an idea tried by a French astronomer in the 1930's, said Dr. Steven E. Koonin, a professor of theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology who collaborated on the work.

Dr. Koonin said that in the early 1990's, he realized new techniques for translating the earthshine into an albedo could turn earthshine into an important tool.

Observers grew accustomed to seeing fluctuations of up to 10 percent in the earthshine over a single night. They also saw unexpectedly large seasonal variations.

The scientists also found sketchy indications that the average albedo was a few percentage points greater around 1995, a minimum of solar activity, compared to the present, a period of maximum activity.

That sort of difference might be expected according to the controversial notion that cosmic rays, or high-energy particles from space, seed clouds. The more powerful magnetic fields generated by the Sun during maximum activity are known to block many of the particles, which would theoretically lead to less cloud cover and less reflection, or a lower albedo.

But many scientists challenge that theory. Aside from the issue of whether cosmic rays really do seed clouds, Dr. Schneider said, some clouds primarily trap heat, warming Earth, and others mainly reflect sunlight, cooling it. Cosmic rays would presumably make both kinds.

Other climate experts echoed that caution but said it did not doom earthshine as a novel way of peering back at Earth.

''It's a valuable new tool for looking at a fundamental aspect of Earth's climate,'' said Dr. Eric Sundquist, a geochemist at the United States Geological Survey and chairman of the American Geophysical Union's committee on global environmental change.

	After a Period of Brightness, Earth Dims, Researchers Say


Tracking the brightness of Earth by looking at its reflection on the Moon, scientists have concluded that sunshine on Earth brightened in the 1990's, then dimmed after 2000.

The findings, being reported today in the journal Science, add a new level of mystery to the recent debate about ''global dimming'' and its causes. Measurements by ground-based instruments around the world have shown a decrease of up to 10 percent in sunlight from the late 1950's to the early 1990's.

''This would say that it reversed through the 80's and 90's to a global brightening and now it's flattening,'' said Dr. Philip R. Goode, a professor of physics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and an author of the Science article. ''And the suggestion is that the trend is turning back to the other direction.''

The output of the Sun varies only slightly, so scientists theorize that global dimming probably results from air pollution. Some light bounces off soot particles in the air. The pollution also causes more water droplets to condense out of air, leading to thicker, darker clouds, which block light. For that reason, the dimming appears to be more pronounced on cloudy days. Some less polluted regions have experienced little or no dimming.

The notion remains controversial because it runs counter to expectations of global warming (less sunlight should mean lower temperatures), and some scientists wonder how widespread the dimming effects are. The ground-based measurements do not cover the oceans.

Unlike the earlier data, the research did not look at sunshine on Earth. Instead, Dr. Goode and colleagues at the Big Bear Solar Observatory in California and the California Institute of Technology used a principle described by Leonardo da Vinci. The bright side of the Moon is lighted by sunshine. The dark side is not completely dark. Rather, as Leonardo deduced, it is dimly illuminated by light reflected off Earth.

Using a small telescope at Big Bear, the astronomers have for the past five years measured the relative brightness of the two sides of the Moon, which tells how much light is bouncing off Earth back into space, what the scientists call ''earthshine.'' The reflectivity is largely a measure of clouds, which are much shinier than the ocean or ground. Thus, a brightening of earthshine means a dimming on Earth's surface, because less light is reaching the ground.

On average, Earth reflects about 30 percent of the incoming sunlight, but that varies day to day and hour to hour. When the Sun rises over a cloudy Asia, earthshine might brighten by 10 percent. Reflectivity also varies by season, higher in April than in October, because the Northern Hemisphere tends to be cloudier than the Southern Hemisphere.

Over all, reflectivity increased -- and sunshine dimmed at the surface -- from 1999 to 2003, with an especially sharp jump last year. But the reflectivity was lower than what the scientists measured during an earlier round of observations in 1994 and 1995. They then took NASA data on cloud cover from1985 to 2000 to calculate the reflectivity. The calculations indicate that Earth reflected 32 percent of sunlight in 1985 and that the reflectivity declined 7 percent over the next 15 years, which would correspond to a brightening of sunshine on Earth.

''It gives at least a good argument that the clouds are not getting thicker globally,'' said Dr. Beate G. Liepert, a research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.

The researchers said they could not say what was driving the changes in reflectivity. ''What we say is somehow the cloud properties have changed,'' Dr. Goode said. The brightening coincided with accelerated rising of global temperatures in the late 1990's.

Other scientists have also reported signs that global dimming halted in the 1990's. At a joint meeting of American and Canadian geological societies in Montreal this month, Dr. Martin Wild, a climatologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, reported that sunshine measurements from 10 stations worldwide showed no signs of dimming during the 90's. ''This is a preliminary result, but I think it gives a clear picture,'' Dr. Wild said.

Dr. Rachel T. Pinker, a professor of meteorology at the University of Maryland, said satellite measurements from July 1983 to September 2001 also showed no signs of dimming.

''On a global scale, we didn't find a decrease,'' Dr. Pinker said. ''In fact, we found a small increase.''

Since 2000, reflectivity has since risen to near the 1985 level. But Dr. Goode said more observations were needed to tell whether the upward jump last year in reflectivity was ''was a hiccup or it's really a trend.''

	The Recycled Generation


Almost every weekday morning, usually before 10:30, an overnight delivery truck with an unusual cargo negotiates the hilly streets on the outskirts of Worcester, Mass., and comes to a halt in front of a brick-and-tinted-glass building called Biotech Three. The courier disappears into the building with one or two large gray containers and drops them off at a small company called Advanced Cell Technology. The gray cases look like toolboxes, but they are actually sophisticated shipping containers, commonly used for transporting materials used in animal-breeding work, and they contain the starting material for a series of experiments that may completely rewrite the tables of human longevity. Or they may be remembered only for being among the most ethically troubling scientific endeavors of our times.

Inside the gray cases are hundreds of cow eggs -- big, plump and beautifully rotund oocytes, as they're technically known -- each one painstakingly plucked the day before from the ovaries of cows slaughtered in Iowa. They are doused with a marinade of enzymes that prime them for imminent fertilization and then sealed in small plastic test tubes before being shipped overnight to Worcester. On the drizzly, overcast day in mid-December when I visited the laboratories at Advanced Cell, the shipment of eggs arrived a little before me. In all the time that cows have roamed the planet, their oocytes have never encountered the insults they were about to face that day. The eggs would be stripped of their DNA, deliberately fused with human cells and fooled into thinking that fertilization had occurred, in the fervent commercial hope that some sort of an embryo might result.

Experimenting with embryos created from two different species -- to say nothing of engaging in a form of human cloning -- is an enterprise fraught with scientific and social uncertainty; indeed, Congress forbids the National Institutes of Health to finance any research involving human embryos. So it's natural to wonder why a small, largely unknown and understaffed biotech company would risk public scorn and ethical outrage to perform such research. One possible reason is publicity, which a number of critics have been eager to suggest. But the real answer, insists Michael D. West, the dreamy-eyed 46-year-old entrepreneur who heads A.C.T., is the scientific chase for what he calls ''the mother of all cells -- the embryonic stem cell.''

The embryonic stem cell is an almost mythically powerful and versatile human cell, fleetingly present during the earliest days of embryonal development. This one cell has the potential -- the genetic blueprint and the biological know-how -- to become any cell, any tissue, any organ in the human body. With the proper biochemical coaxing, for example, it can turn into heart muscle, which could replace tissue damaged by a heart attack. Or into brain cells, which could be used to treat Parkinson's disease. Or into retinal cells, which could be used to restore failing vision.

Imagine, in short, a cell so protean and potent that it could theoretically generate an infinite supply of replaceable body parts -- organ and skin, sinew and bone, blood and brain -- to knit the tatters of disease, injury or old age. Imagine further that, with the use of controversial technologies like cloning, you might one day donate a snippet of your own skin, allowing scientists to harvest stem cells that theoretically would become a self-generated and limitless supply of transplant tissue -- tissue that would make a perfect immunological match with you because, after all, it is you. These ideas have not only been imagined; patents and licensing agreements are already in place.

''These are incredible cells,'' gushes Thomas B. Okarma of Geron Corporation, the California biotechnology company that controls many of the patents and licenses on stem cells. ''I've been in biology since high school, and this is still a chilling technology when you see these things and realize what they do. The number of applications is mind-boggling.'' Last month, Science magazine dubbed stem-cell technology the ''breakthrough of the year.''

In spite of this promise, the scientific, commercial and ethical landscapes that intersect with these fascinating cells have been shaped, even turned upside down, by the right-to-life debate, because in order to obtain human embryonic stem cells by currently available technology, you must destroy a human embryo. Because of the Congressional ban on financing of this research, many scientists now find themselves in the awkward position of possibly losing their jobs if they try to use human stem cells to devise new treatments for many common diseases. ''With stem cells,'' says Ronald McKay, a researcher at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, ''you tickle them and they jump through hoops for you.'' McKay's group published a highly regarded paper in Science last summer showing how rat embryonic-stem cells could be used to treat a version of multiple sclerosis in rats, but he doesn't dare extend the research to test the method's effectiveness in humans. ''I would get fired if I did that,'' McKay says, fairly squirming in his seat to make this seem like the most reasonable thing in the world.

The ban on N.I.H. financing has also had the collateral effect of relegating the technology to the private sector, where embryo research can proceed unencumbered. But the fact that so much of this controversial research now occurs in the private sector means that public discussion has become constrained. And complicating this commercial landscape is the fact that two of the companies most avidly competing over the research, Geron and Advanced Cell Technology, have a tangled corporate history dating back to business opportunities created by the federal ban.

The common figure wandering through all these unsettled landscapes, popping up again and again like some white-coated Zelig is Michael West. West's insistence on pursuing controversial experiments in which cow eggs are used as cellular incubators in an attempt to create humanlike embryos comes at a particularly sensitive moment. Emboldened by a legal interpretation that seemed to show a way around the Congressional ban, the N.I.H. on Dec. 2 issued long-awaited guidelines explaining the rules by which the agency would finance human-stem-cell research. The 60-day comment period ends tomorrow, and the agency hopes to begin soliciting grant proposals from university researchers sometime this summer.

However, Representative Jay Dickey, a Republican from Arkansas who has blocked N.I.H. financing for embryo research since 1995, has already vowed to outlaw federally financed stem-cell research this spring, either through legislation or legal action. Senator Arlen Specter, meanwhile, who is entranced by the medical possibilities, has promised to introduce a bill explicitly allowing federal financing for the research.

West, whose laid-back, soft-spoken demeanor belies the soul of a headstrong provocateur, promises to be an impassioned voice in this debate, too. ''I think a lot of the problem we have in trying to develop these new technologies for medicine is people's knee-jerk reaction to words like 'fetal' and 'embryo,''' he says. ''You know, you use the word 'fetal' and people just go completely irrational.''

Until we learn how to direct the fate of human embryonic stem cells -- learn how to tell them, for example, that we'd like them to become a new liver or glistening white bone -- their enormous promise still remains under Nature's lock and key. Many scientists believe it will take at least 10 years before we learn how to program the development of cells that could be transplanted into humans, and probably many more before we learn how to coax stem cells into creating something as grand and complex as a liver or a kidney.

But let's say some version of the science will be in practice by the year 2011, when the first of the baby boomers turn 65. And let's say the technology of stem cells will be complemented by promissory notes redeemed in related fields of gerontological science. What might the menu of spare parts look like?

The first step in creating those spare parts (which could be used not only for the aged but also for anyone in need of intervention) might well be the donation by the patient of a biopsy sample, which could be quickly cloned, thus creating an early embryo, which would produce stem cells in a week or so. Every cell and every tissue derived from those stem cells would be a perfect immunological match, which would immediately circumvent the big stumbling block of current transplant medicine: matching tissue.

At that point, it simply becomes a matter of matching the ailment to the right cell type. Researchers speak of creating nerve cells to treat spinal-cord injuries, stroke and Alzheimer's disease; glial cells for multiple sclerosis; pancreatic islet cells to treat diabetes; muscle cells for muscular dystrophy; chondrocytes for arthritis; hepatocytes for cholesterol metabolism; endothelial vessels to grow new blood vessels to replace vessels clogged by fat and plaque -- there are more than 200 different cell types in the body, and stem cells can theoretically be nudged to form each one. If these cells are souped up, as has been proposed, with an enzyme that maintains its cellular youthfulness, we're talking not only about replacement parts, but also about parts that never grow old.

What might the world of stem-cell medicine look like? For one thing, every place in the developed world might look a lot more like Florida. Although the maximum attainable human life span is now approximately 120 years, only about 65,000 Americans have currently reached the age of 100. But a century from now, with new medical technologies in place, the Census Bureau predicts there will be 5.3million people living to the age of 100 and perhaps much longer. To hear the optimists talk, there'll be much longer waits for tennis courts and tee times.

This is the kind of speculation that keeps ethicists and philosophers busy, but there are a lot of touchier issues on the immediate horizon -- creating embryos for research purposes, combining biological material from different species and performing nuclear-transfer experiments involving adult human cells (also known as cloning). All three are being pursued in a single line of research at Advanced Cell Technology.

The experiments at A.C.T. take place in a long, dark, narrow room in the middle of the lab. The lights are kept low to allow technicians to view the cells through microscopes while poking, turning and prodding them with micromanipulation devices. K.C. Cunniff, her blond hair spilling out over a white lab coat, begins by vacuuming all of the cow's genetic material from the egg cells, one after another, for more than an hour.

As I watch a magnified view of the proceedings on a television monitor, it's hard not to be impressed by the nimble piecework of the technicians. Cunniff, 26, deftly maneuvers one pipette to hold a round, plump egg cell in place. (They prefer cow eggs because they are inexpensive and easier to use than either pig or primate oocytes). She turns the egg, which had previously been stained with a fluorescing dye, as if rotating a ball in her hand, until she sees a telltale blue-green speck of DNA. Using her other hand, she nudges a sharp, hollow needle up against the surface of the egg. With a precise thrust, she enters the egg, sucks out the DNA and withdraws the needle, all in a matter of seconds. ''Very quick,'' she says matter-of-factly. In, suction, out. Next egg. In, suction, out.

It's so matter-of-fact that you'd never guess this type of experiment was the focus of wildly fearful predictions only a few years ago. In 1997, when scientists at the Roslin Institute in Scotland announced the cloning of Dolly the sheep, there was a lot of fevered speculation about the possibility of cloning human beings. It was generally dismissed as both a distant and undesirable proposition, but the sudden appeal of embryonic stem cells has provided a surprisingly urgent medical justification for moving the technology of human cloning closer to reality.

In the case of A.C.T.'s experiments, the cow egg is being tested as a way to ''reprogram,'' or reset, the adult DNA back to a pristine state resembling the moment of fertilization. In these experiments, the egg comes from a cow but the adult DNA comes from human donors; it's the human DNA, West believes, that orchestrates subsequent embryonic development. The technical term for this type of experiment is ''nuclear transfer,'' but West prefers a more transparent phrase -- human therapeutic cloning.'' That modifier ''therapeutic'' signals that A.C.T. is not in the business of making babies, just embryos to get stem cells. And they're not alone in pursuing the nuclear-transfer approach. Last May, to remarkably little public comment, Geron acquired Roslin Bio-Med, the Scottish company in charge of commercializing the research that produced Dolly.

As Cunniff moves another cow egg into position, Nancy Sawyer gazes at the TV monitor and makes a sound like ''Unk!'' as the needle punctures the egg. ''That's so cool,'' she whispers of the image. Seen on the monitor, the image has a primal iconic beauty, like a dim grainy photograph of a distant planet. On each moonlike oocyte, one isolated lunar mare glows with an eerie greenish blue, betraying the location of genetic material that will soon be suctioned away.

At a nearby microscope, Sawyer, 24, performs the next step. Human skin cells, known as fibroblasts, have been provided by an anonymous donor. The human cells dot the screen like so many lumpy, transparent potatoes, much smaller than the egg cells. Sawyer loads them into a hollow needle, immobilizes a cow egg with suction and, with gentle pressure, inserts the needle tip just under the rind of the egg. With a squeeze of her hand, a single human skin cell, with its unique payload of human DNA, plops into the egg of a creature that moos. Sawyer even manages to maneuver her needle tip to literally tuck the hole closed.

After stuffing every cow egg with its little spud of human DNA, Sawyer prepares the next step. She gives the cells a zap of 120 volts. The jolt of electricity effectively fuses man and beast into a single biological fate. After one final step, this . . . this thing will believe it has been fertilized and, if all goes well, begin cleaving, or dividing, in the bubbling, momentous arithmetic of life lifting off the pad: 2 cells, 4 cells, 8 cells, 16 cells, 32 cells -- blastocyst!

The odds are extremely long that any of the 100 or so cell fusions will result in a blastocyst, the hollow ball of cells that appear about a week after fertilization and, in a normal embryo, are destined to become the placenta. But if that ball of cells should form, a separate group of cells known as the inner cell mass assembles against one inside wall of the blastocyst, like bats huddling on the ceiling of a cave, and this is where the embryonic stem cells will appear. These stem cells exist only briefly before they begin to differentiate into more specialized tissues -- there one moment and gone the next, transients vanishing into the great biology of becoming. ''If I'm lucky,'' says Jose Cibelli, vice president of research at A.C.T., ''I'll get one blastocyst. That's how low the efficiency is.'' And getting the blastocyst is just the first hurdle -- can they isolate the stem cells and keep them alive in a test tube? And will they truly act like human embryonic stem cells?

Before leaving Worcester that day, I ask Cibelli when he will know if any blastocysts have formed from the experiment I've observed. He says he wouldn't expect to see anything before 9 or 10 days. I do the math in my head and make a mental note to get in touch either on December 24 or Christmas Day.

In many ways Michael West is the shadow impresario of the field. As founder of Geron Corporation, one of this decade's most closely watched biotechnology companies, and now as president and C.E.O. of Advanced Cell Technology, West has achieved remarkable success as a kind of merchant of immortality, selling the idea that stem cells and related technologies might someday completely revise the tables of average human life span. And he is so convinced that the promise of stem cells justifies a controversial strategy like cow-human nuclear transfer that he is happy to foster, if not force, a national discussion of this technology.

In a recent issue of the journal Nature Medicine, for example, West, Cibelli and their colleague Robert Lanza argued the case for human therapeutic cloning because stem-cell research is so promising. ''Does a blastocyst,'' they wrote, ''warrant the same rights and reverence as that accorded a living soul -- a parent, a child or a partner -- who might die because we failed to move the moral line?'' And that is what Mike West is trying to do at this touchy juncture of the stem-cell wars -- with this company, in these experiments, in an ethical debate that has seemed too arcane and complicated to attract much public attention to date. He is putting his shoulder to the moral line that forbids embryo research and is trying to force some sort of social reckoning. The degree to which he and others succeed or fail may well determine if stem cells have a chance to live up to their promise as medicine or remain too hot to handle in the current political climate.

Stem cells burst into public consciousness little more than a year ago. In November 1998, James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin reported the creation of human embryonic stem (or E.S.) cell lines. Using leftover frozen embryos from in-vitro fertilization clinics in Wisconsin and Israel, Thomson and colleagues isolated stem cells and have shown that they can be maintained indefinitely in the lab -- can be grown, frozen and then thawed, and still retain their power to develop into, say, heart-muscle cells or brain cells. Michael Shamblott and John Gearhart, at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, headed a separate effort to cultivate something called ''embryonic germline'' (E.G.) cells, which are harvested from a tiny speck of fetal tissue from an aborted fetus and then grown in the lab. Because of the Congressional ban on federal financing for human-embryo experimentation, both teams conducted the research with financing from Geron.

There are many technical hurdles to overcome. But the sheer power of the approach makes it clear that, if properly harnessed, stem cells could serve as a warehouse of spare human parts. This teasing hint of immortality is the cultural subtext that runs beneath the public fascination with the science, and no one has done more to promote that connection than West. The son of a truck mechanic, West is a onetime creationist and a self-styled truth seeker, and his entrepreneurial interest in the biology of aging derives from an obsessive, almost morbid fascination with death. ''All I think about, all day long, every day, is human mortality and our own aging,'' he says.

The first time I visited Advanced Cell Technology, West showed up two hours late for our appointment, apologized with sheepish charm for his tardiness and began to spin out the kind of polished futurism he regularly conveys to scientists, investors and lay people. ''I thought I'd show you some pictures,'' he said, and then proceeded to project slides on a screen in the company's conference room, delivering a lecture on the biology of aging to an audience of one. With his gently soothing Midwestern voice and relentlessly upbeat brand of biological positivism, he manages to make science sound almost like a cult. Former colleagues concede that he does not possess a crisp management style (punctuality, for example, being a continuing challenge), but even his critics admit he has a knack for looking beyond the horizon and dreaming deep. He'll talk for hours about saving endangered species through cloning, or the possibility of cloning pets, or why it makes more economic and ethical sense to pay $1 for a cow egg than $2,000 to surgically obtain a single human egg. ''He's a very visionary guy,'' says James Thomson, a University of Wisconsin biologist, ''but he's also a very good salesman.''

Even as a high-school student growing up in Niles, Mich., West was fascinated with aging and rejuvenation. He immersed himself in religion and philosophy. He learned Hebrew and Greek, he says, to read ancient texts in the original. He went on to study psychology at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, obtained a Masters of Science degree at Andrews University, a Seventh-day Adventist school, and even studied creationism for a time in San Diego, he says, before convincing himself of the truth of Darwinian evolution. Following the death of his father in 1980, West worked in the family's truck-leasing business and then belatedly embarked on a career in science. He received his Ph.D. in cell biology from the Baylor College of Medicine in 1989 and started medical school at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.

That same year, West showed up unannounced and began to hang out at the University of Texas lab of Woodring Wright and Jerry Shay, who were researching the molecular biology of aging. Four years earlier, scientists had discovered a critically important enzyme called telomerase, which acts on telomeres, the little caps of DNA at the end of chromosomes; telomeres ordinarily grow shorter each time a cell divides, until the cells stop dividing altogether. It turned out that a handful of human cells -- germ cells, cancer cells and embryonic stem cells -- use telomerase to circumvent that shortening process, and thus also circumvent the aging process and achieve a cellular version of immortality.

As West learned more about telomeres, he eventually came to view the enzyme telomerase as a molecular version of the fountain of youth; it looked as if it might bestow immortality on normal cells and, conversely, could have the beneficial effect of pulling the plug on immortality in cancer cells if blocked. While still technically enrolled in medical school, West moved out to California and banged on doors in search of seed money for a biotech startup. Thus, in November 1990, he founded a company dedicated to the molecular causes of aging. He named it Geron -- Greek for ''old person.'' He eventually captured the interest of the most prestigious venture-capital firm on the West Coast, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, which along with other firms invested $7.6 million in Geron in 1992.

For a company that has lost tens of millions of dollars and is in no danger of curing aging anytime soon, Geron has managed to cast a spell on investors, the media and the lay public. In both technical articles and news releases, it has retailed a scientific vision (and vocabulary) that clearly push the right zeitgeist buttons. West and Geron spoke tirelessly of ''immortalizing enzymes'' and the ''life extension'' of cells; Geron is almost universally recognized as an ''anti-aging'' company. And in 1997, after winning a highly competitive race to clone (and patent) the human gene for telomerase, Geron actually had a real molecule around which to develop clinical products. The company currently has a number of promising directions for telomerase-based products, including potential anticancer applications, but the mythology is so firmly established that even though company officials insist Geron is no longer an ''anti-aging company,'' this is still how it is inevitably portrayed.

From the very beginning, however, West had another big idea he wanted to pursue. ''You need replaceable cells and tissues for the problems of aging as well,'' he said. ''And it seemed to me that the ideal source for an aging population is to go back to the beginning of life.'' To the embryo, that is, and stem cells. And so, as early as 1992, he paid a visit to Roger Pedersen, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California at San Francisco, and a leading expert on embryonic stem cells in mice. They both agreed that the time had arrived to explore the vast potential of such embryonic stem cells in human medicine, and West inquired into whether Pedersen would accept financing from Geron to do research on human stem cells.

Pedersen flatly refused: ''This area of investigation is something that is at the headwaters, and it's not appropriate for private investors to control the headwaters of a stream of research.''

Several years later, however, Pedersen got back in touch with West. Circumstances had changed, he said, and he was ready to deal.

The circumstances were political. In 1975, federal regulations stipulated that any government support for in-vitro-fertilization research required the approval of a federal ethics advisory board. After a short and turbulent history, this board was disbanded in 1980 without a single research project having received government funds. One cynical stratagem of the Reagan and Bush administrations, according to Pedersen, was to block all attempts to reconstitute the panel, effectively thwarting such research throughout the 1980's.

Under the new Clinton administration, Congress did away with the phantom federal ethics review and set up a special N.I.H. committee to establish guidelines for human-embryo research. Everything seemed back on track when, early in 1995, Jay Dickey, the Republican congressman from Arkansas, successfully inserted a rider into the budget bill for the Department of Health and Human Services (which includes the N.I.H.) banning federal funds for human embryo research. Just as right-to-life politics had forced in-vitro fertilization and reproductive biology into the private sector, where lack of oversight and regulation has led to a series of well-documented scandals, stem-cell research seemed headed for similar privatization.

Those were the circumstances that had changed Roger Pedersen's mind. Geron reached an agreement with the University of California to finance Pedersen's work on embryonic stem cells. During his discussions with West, Pedersen mentioned that a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, James Thomson, was about to publish a paper announcing another breakthrough: the isolation of embryonic stem cells from rhesus monkeys. West was in Wisconsin the next day, and Geron signed up Thomson too.

''I would have been much happier with public support,'' Thomson admits. ''But given the constraints, I welcomed the funding I got.'' Getting access to stem cells from a primate, an animal biologically close to humans, West realized, promised tremendous intellectual-property dividends. ''We could just learn how to work with them, and file patents,'' he said. ''But we'd have this head start on the whole world.'' When West later learned that another university researcher, John Gearhart at Johns Hopkins, had made significant progress isolating cells very similar to embryonic stem cells, he headed straight for Baltimore. ''He just showed up on my doorstep one day,'' Gearhart recalled with a laugh.

With Pedersen acting as talent scout, West chased down and signed up three of the leading stem-cell researchers in the world. Geron began to assemble a staggering intellectual-property portfolio in a field with almost limitless medical potential. And because the Congressional right-to-life advocates had effectively tied the N.I.H.'s hands in terms of financing, there wasn't any competing research in university labs. The investment paid off spectacularly in November 1998, when both Thomson and Gearhart announced they had isolated human stem cells. The universities where the work was done retained the patents on the research, but Geron received exclusive rights to many applications.

Unfortunately, Mike West enjoyed this moment of triumph only vicariously, because by then he had left the company, unhappily. In 1997, according to several sources, Geron planned to spin off its entire stem-cell program into a separate company, which would include West, when the plan, in the words of a scientific board member of the company, ''got clobbered by the company leadership.'' Thomas Okarma, who joined Geron in December 1997 and is now president, offers a different interpretation. ''I was hired explicitly to run that program because it really wasn't moving,'' he said. In any event, the stem-cell research stayed at Geron, and West says he increasingly felt he could do more outside the confines of the company than inside.

The fact that West's current company, Advanced Cell Technology, is now competing against the company he founded may go a long way toward explaining why Mike West is so determined to find an alternative way of obtaining human stem cells, one that doesn't rely on existing human embryos in clinics or fetal material from abortions -- the methods that Wisconsin and Johns Hopkins licensed to Geron. And it certainly explains why he perked up when, a few months after leaving Geron, he learned of an unusual experiment by Jose Cibelli, an Argentinian scientist working at Advanced Cell Technology. The good news was that Cibelli had tried to isolate human stem cells using a method that seemed to offer an alternative to Geron's approach. The bad news was that the strategy involved human cloning. And cows. ''And I knew,'' West says, ''that was going to be a problem.''

In the summer of 1996, Cibelli was a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, working in the laboratory of James Robl, a respected developmental biologist. Cibelli had the radical idea of fusing some of his own cells with cow egg cells, in effect cloning himself -- not to make a copy, of course, but as a way to get human stem cells. Interestingly, this wasn't the first time Robl had been confronted with such an idea. Several years earlier, a student in the lab, unbeknown to Robl, had fused human cells with the egg cells of a rabbit, and the cells had begun to divide. This time, Robl went to university officials and received institutional approval to proceed.

During July and August, Cibelli rinsed out some of the cells that lined the inside of his cheeks and tried fusing them with cow egg cells. ''One day, Jose was about to go on vacation, and he was about to throw out the dish,'' Robl recalls. ''I don't generally look at these things, but I did that day. And there was a blastocyst.'' In other words, the embryolike thing had moved beyond mere cell division and graduated to the stage where embryonic stem cells begin to form. As is routine when the experiment reaches this stage, Cibelli placed the fragile blastocyst on a bed of fetal mouse cells, which nourished its further development. ''We watched it for about two more weeks,'' Robl says. ''It looked, to my eye, not like a cow blastocyst. The morphology of the cells was different.''

Cibelli and Robl did not publicly discuss the experiment at the time, nor did they prepare a scientific report for peer review. ''We never considered a publication,'' Robl explains, ''because there was not nearly sufficient data.'' But the University of Massachusetts did consider the experiment sufficiently novel to file a patent application. The United States patent was issued, virtually unnoticed, last August.

Cibelli recounted this remarkable story to West in the spring of 1998, when West happened to be visiting A.C.T. ''I was just flabbergasted,'' West recalls. ''I mean, he showed me human embryos that had been made by cloning. And I had no idea -- no one in the world had any idea -- that it had been done. I thought, 'Oh my gosh, this is exactly what I want to be doing for the next 10 or 20 years of my life.''' More to the point, it was exactly the kind of technology that would allow him to get back into the stem-cell game.

West officially joined A.C.T. in October 1998 and immediately presided over an episode that was, for him, uncharacteristic -- a major public-relations fiasco. As soon as West joined the company, Cibelli lobbied to resume his cloning experiments. West agreed, but wanted to disclose details of the 1996 experiment and gauge public reaction to the technology before starting it up again. ''I didn't want to be accused of doing this in secret,'' he says. So he invited a film crew from the CBS newsmagazine ''48 Hours'' to film the work in progress.

Then, one week before the scheduled broadcast, on Nov. 6, West got blindsided by his previous life. Geron announced Thomson and Gearhart's successes isolating stem cells. ''I had no idea it was coming,'' West admitted. It wasn't just that the research made front-page headlines and drove Geron stock up 74 percent in one day. By the time CBS broadcast the show on Nov. 12, along with a news account of the experiments that appeared in that morning's New York Times, West's professed desire for openness looked like something entirely different: a bid to leverage ''me too'' publicity for his otherwise unknown company.

For an experiment that never received formal peer review, Cibelli's cow-human nuclear-transfer work got plenty of unofficial feedback, beginning with the White House. Clinton called it ''deeply troubling.'' Thomas Murray, president of the Hastings Center and a leading bioethicist, wondered ''if the timing of the announcement had to do with scientific competition, personal competition or positioning for funding from investors.'' Roger Pedersen was quoted as saying, ''I smell a sham.'' (He claims he wasn't told who performed the experiment when he was asked to comment upon it.) Thomson regarded the whole affair as ''unfortunate.'' Right-to-life pickets showed up outside Biotech Three in Worcester, marching around in cow masks.

Two days after news of the cow-human experiments broke, President Clinton asked his National Bioethics Advisory Commission to prepare a report on stem-cell research in general. The commission hastily convened hearings in January 1999 in Washington. And who should turn up, uninvited, to make an unscheduled presentation before the panel but Michael West.

'I read an editorial by an individual who wrote that science should stop so that ethics can catch up,'' West told the national commission that day. His ambition, he said, was ''to communicate to people in public policy and in biomedical ethics, so that, simply, ethics can walk hand in hand with science.'' Ethics and modern biology, however, have rarely walked hand in hand, and stem-cell research has added new difficulties to the relationship.

Over the past year, two high-powered advisory committees have, with one significant difference, endorsed the general idea of embryonic-stem-cell research. A committee established by the American Association for the Advancement of Science recommended last August that researchers be able to receive public funds for experiments on embryonic stem cells, but only using cell lines already created by researchers in the private sector. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission, by contrast, recommended last September that researchers financed by the N.I.H. should be allowed to create stem cells using human embryos already in existence (thousands of such embryos, frozen and destined to be discarded, exist at in-vitro fertilization clinics).

But no oversight or guidelines exist for private industry, and in February 1999, well before either committee delivered its opinion, Advanced Cell Technology quietly decided to resume its cow-human nuclear-transfer experiments. It seemed like an important decision for such socially sensitive research, so I asked West if it was something that went to the board or an ethics advisory panel for approval. West said it was strictly his decision. And there's the paradox. Now that abortion politics has forced so much of the research into the private sector, the transparency of the ethical conversation about it has become more obscured.

Everyone, including Mike West, insists on an open national debate about stem-cell research. But I began to notice that whenever I asked one question too many about exactly what work was being done, or even contemplated, the conversations became elliptical and vague. I was having lunch with West one day, for example, when I asked if the use of human donor eggs for cloning experiments was under consideration. Cibelli had told me he thought such a development was very likely. ''I have to confer on this issue,'' West replied apologetically, leaning over to huddle with A.C.T.'s public-relations adviser. Then, after a pause but without directly answering the question, he expressed concern that such a program could exploit women.

For all their good intentions, ethicists may have allowed themselves to be placed in a difficult, possibly untenable position. At Geron, for instance, the company's ethics advisory board seems to have the ear of management. But, says Karen Lebacqz, who heads the Geron ethics advisory board, ''they are perfectly at liberty to ignore all our advice.'' Further, as Lebacqz points out, she is not free to discuss certain aspects of the research. ''Early last summer, they brought us a piece of research that they were going to fund. Several members of the board raised objections, so they decided not to pursue that particular line of research.'' What was the research under discussion? ''I'm sorry, I really can't,'' she said.

The ethicists have become proxies for all of us, precisely because so much of this technology, for political reasons, is unfolding in the private sector. Yet they have limited power. West, for example, told me that when Geron first considered establishing an ethics board, the company determined that giving such a board the right to veto research projects would undermine its fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders. The ethicists have what West calls ''the power of the pen,'' but what they can report back to us is constrained.

Their mere participation in the process, however, creates the appearance of oversight and ethical responsibility, and that is precisely what bothers David Cox, vice chairman of the genetics department at Stanford University and a member of the national bioethics commission. Cox says ethics advisory boards at biotech companies are ''a joke'': ''They're supposedly doing ethical review, but the process by which they're working is backwards.''

It's very hard to have a national debate on issues as socially and ethically important as cloning and the creation of embryonic stem cells when every conversation may ultimately bump up against corporate confidentiality. The problem of openness is compounded by the editorial policy at a number of leading scientific journals, which refuse to publish research if the results have previously been disclosed in public. That almost guarantees that breakthroughs in a controversial and competitive field of research like stem cells will land in the public's lap as scientific faits accomplis, just as Dolly did.

And it leaves us in the same scientifically uncertain and ethically queasy place we were more than a year ago. At that time, Thomas Murray of the national bioethics commission asked West if he thought the cow-human experiments resulted in human embryos that were potentially ''viable'' -- in other words, embryos that, if implanted in a woman, could result in a live human being. West didn't answer, and A.C.T. still isn't answering. I asked Jose Cibelli, for example, if the A.C.T. scientists had made any progress overcoming the problem of biological incompatibility between a cow egg and a human cell, an issue involving small cellular organs called mitochondria; it is an obstacle repeatedly raised by the many scientists who remain skeptical about the approach and are dubious that a blastocyst would be created, especially since A.C.T. still hasn't published a sprig of data on it in more than a year.

''We think,'' Cibelli began to say, ''but this is very preliminary. . . . '' He shrugged and smiled. ''You can say that we've had good progress,'' he continued with a little laugh. ''We've had good progress, and we expect to have something to report in the near future. But I guess I need to be protective of the data for publication's sake.''

Michael West sounded a similar theme when I told him how many complaints I'd heard about A.C.T's unpublished experiments. ''We could publish now, the data we have,'' West assured me, well aware of the exasperation of the research community. ''But,'' he continued, ''we're trying to generate a real killer paper here. We're going to do a paper we're proud of.''

On Christmas Eve, I sent an e-mail to Jose Cibelli, asking about the status of the cells I'd seen fused. The day after Christmas he wrote back to report that the nuclear-transfer units had ''developed at the 'predictable' rate,'' while declining to specify exactly what that was. As soon as new techniques were in place, he continued, Advanced Cell Technology would report the results in a peer-reviewed journal.

As congress prepares to debate the merits of stem-cell research in the coming months, we will undoubtedly hear rosy visions of the future of medicine with stem cells (as well as the contorted political logic that suggests that research on human embryos and cross-species nuclear-transfer experiments are permissible in the private sector, but morally indefensible in the public sector). But it's also worth thinking through the implications of immortalizing medicines, which I had the opportunity to do with Leonard Hayflick, the elder statesman (and elder contrarian) of the field.

Hayflick, now 71, is a well-known cell biologist; his discovery in 1961 that normal human cells grown in a test tube simply stop dividing after a specific number of cell divisions, known as the Hayflick limit, in effect introduced the notion of mortality into the biology of aging. We arranged to meet at the Union Club in Manhattan in early December, when Hayflick showed up to harangue fellow board members of the American Federation for Aging Research about their financing priorities.

Hayflick doubts we'll ever have a quick fix to arrest aging anytime soon, but he has lots of reasons to think it would be a very bad idea. Like a number of bioethicists, he believes the first line of division is economic. Access to the regenerative medicine of stem-cell and immortalizing enzymes is most likely to be a phenomenon available only to affluent segments of the population in the developed world.

In his book ''How and Why We Age'' and other writings, Hayflick has even gone to the trouble of imagining ''bizarre situations'' that might unfold if scientists were ultimately able to create a medication that would, from the moment treatment began, essentially freeze the process of aging at a certain point. He has imagined ''children becoming biologically older than their parents'' if a parent chose to stop aging at age 45, for example, while a child did nothing. How would you even know, he asks, the right age to stop at?

Karen Lebacqz has also pondered this distant future. ''If we are successful with the use of stem cells or in the reprogramming of cells,'' she says, ''it will mean that people are no longer dying of the things we are dying of today. What do we do with all of ourselves if we don't die?'' We'll squander even more of the world's resources, she continues, and put even more pressure on the developing world.

But perhaps the ultimate argument against the implicit promise of immortality has to do with a simple biological fact: if we were to rejuvenate our brains, Hayflick argues, we might lose the most precious thing we have: our sense of self. ''Given the possibility that we could replace all our parts, including our brain, then you lose your self-identity, your self-recognition. You lose who you are! You are who you are because of your memory.''

There is a lot of scientific research and a lot of heated political debate to come before we arrive at any of those distant quandaries. And how we resolve the ethical conversations we're in the midst of having over stem cells will have a lot to say about whether we'll have a chance of reaching that future at all.

	Use of Cloning to Tailor Treatment Has Big Hurdles, Including Cost


A Massachusetts biotechnology company, Advanced Cell Technology, provoked a storm of outrage last month by reporting that it was trying to create human embryos by cloning. But the company faces another difficult challenge: its goal, the use of such therapeutic cloning to produce useful treatments, may simply be impractical.

That is because the approach, if it works, will involve cloning patients individually in order to develop treatments tailored to them.

''It's too laborious and costly to employ as a routine therapeutic procedure,'' said Dr. Alan Colman, research director at PPL Therapeutics, the Scottish company that helped cloned Dolly the sheep.

Other leading stem cell companies apparently agree.

For one thing, unless success rates improve drastically, the therapeutic cloning will require a large number of eggs -- and women willing to donate them -- to make clones for the thousands or even millions of potential patients.

''They're never going to have enough women's eggs available to do it,'' said Dr. Alan Trounson, director of the Monash Institute of Reproduction and Development in Australia and an adviser to ES Cell International, a company based in Singapore and Australia.

Companies in the stem cell field have to be conscious of business issues because many prospective investors are skeptical about the field. The investors believe the payoff may not come for many years. Even then, many believe, cell transplants will not be as profitable a business as mass producing drugs.

The companies' lack of interest in therapeutic cloning raises questions about how vigorously business leaders, scientists and patient groups will fight to prevent a ban on the practice.

The goal of therapeutic cloning is not to create babies, but rather embryos from which embryonic stem cells can be harvested. The stem cells can theoretically be turned into other types of tissues, like nerve, heart and liver cells, that have the potential to repair organs and cure diseases.

One potential problem is that stem cells are now created from embryos left over in fertility clinics, and tissues transplanted from those embryos may be rejected by a patient's immune system as foreign. With therapeutic cloning, scientists would make an embryo clone of the patient, remove its stem cells and use them to grow needed tissue, which presumably would not be rejected.

But executives of stem cell companies say making such customized tissue will be extremely expensive. ''That's a product of one, so the costs are going to be enormous,'' said Dr. Allan Robins, chief scientific officer of BresaGen Ltd., an Australian stem cell company. He estimated the costs at hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient.

Dr. Michael J. Ross, chief executive of San Diego-based CyThera Inc., said getting such individualized therapy approved by regulators might be hard because of problems verifying the safety of each tissue batch. ''The amount of testing you can do for an individual patient is significantly less than if you're doing a drug for a million people,'' he said.

These executives say there are other ways to overcome rejection that will allow standardized embryonic stem cell lines to be used instead of having to create a customized cell line for each patient. New drugs are being developed to supplement existing anti-rejection drugs, which can have severe side effects. Dr. Robins said 200 different stem cell lines could be made so that virtually every patient could find a close match, to minimize rejection.

Dr. Thomas B. Okarma, chief executive of Geron Corporation of Menlo Park, Calif., said his company was trying to genetically engineer stem cells so they would not be recognized as foreign by immune systems.

Another idea would be to make bone marrow cells out of the stem cells and put them into the patient's bone marrow -- where the cells of the immune system are generated -- to try to create a mixed immune system, something that has happened with some bone marrow transplants. Then, the tissue could be transplanted and would not be seen by the immune system as foreign.

But Dr. Robert P. Lanza, vice president for medical and scientific development at Advanced Cell Technology, said all those approaches had been worked on for decades, so far without success.

For now, he insisted, therapeutic cloning remains the best option. ''None of us would be doing it if there was another way of doing it,'' said Dr. Lanza, who is an expert on transplant immunology.

Dr. Lanza would not estimate how much treatment using therapeutic cloning would cost, but he said it would be worth it for life-threatening diseases. And he said friends or relatives would donate eggs to make the clones of the patients, just as people now donate kidneys to loved ones. Donating eggs is far easier than donating organs, he pointed out.

In therapeutic cloning, a cell, perhaps a skin cell, would be taken from the patient. The cell's nucleus, containing its DNA, would be put into an egg that had had its own nucleus removed. The egg would be tricked, in effect, into believing it had been fertilized and would turn into an embryo. In about five days the embryo would grow into what is a called a blastocyst, from which stem cells could be extracted. The stem cells would then be cultured to grow into self-sustaining colonies and treated with various chemicals to turn into different types of tissue like nerves or heart cells.

But now the process is inefficient, and it may require 30 to 100 eggs for each patient. In one experiment with mice reported in April, scientists at Rockefeller University started with 1,016 eggs that had already had their own nuclei removed and each had the donor nucleus or cell put in. They ended up with 35 embryonic cell lines, a success rate of about one cell line for every 29 eggs.

Researchers at Monash University, also working with mice, got one stem cell line after starting with 926 eggs. Only 39 percent of the eggs even survived the first step -- taking out the egg's DNA and putting in the donor DNA.

It is not clear whether the numbers will be the same for humans. The Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine in Norfolk, Va., using in vitro fertilization rather than cloning, started with 162 women's eggs and got three stem cell lines. Advanced Cell Technology, in the first cloning of human embryos, started with 71 eggs and got no stem cells because no embryos developed into proper blastocysts. The company tried both cloning and another technique aimed at creating embryos out of unfertilized eggs.

Women who undergo in vitro fertilization typically produce 10 to 15 eggs after days of hormone injections. So if 30 to 100 eggs were needed per patient, more than one egg donor might be needed. Patients needing stem cells might end up competing with couples seeking egg donors.

Dr. Alan DeCherney, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles and editor of the journal Fertility and Sterility, said a large source of eggs might be the roughly 20 percent of eggs collected at fertility clinics that failed to be fertilized.

But those eggs may fail to be fertilized because they are defective, so it is unclear if they are usable for cloning, he and others said. There may also be ethical problems with using them. And while it appears that fertility clinics get tens of thousands of unfertilized eggs each year, that would be enough for only a few thousand therapeutic cloning treatments.

''We really have to find a way of dispensing with eggs we collect from women,'' said Dr. Peter Mombaerts, assistant professor at Rockefeller University and a scientific adviser to Advanced Cell Technology. One way, he said, may be to use animal eggs, something the company has tried. Another approach may be to make eggs out of stem cells, since stem cells can theoretically be used to make any kind of cell.

But therapeutic cloning is years from being tried on patients in any case, and by then the efficiency may have improved, reducing both the number of eggs required and the cost of the procedure. Even executives who said they did not think therapeutic cloning would be practical also said the practice should not be banned. At this early stage, so little is known about which technology is best that all options should be kept open, they said.

	Don't Get Stung: Outsmarting The Mosquito


It's the season of the whine -- the high-pitched note that signals a prowling mosquito near your ear, and the even more annoying complaints emitted by humans wondering whether mosquitoes really should have a place in the web of life.

It's also the season of gadgets and sprays. The pressure to defeat the ubiquitous little bloodsuckers is greater than ever, since mosquitoes may carry West Nile virus or Eastern equine encephalitis, as well as cause the familiar red, itchy bumps. Also, mosquitoes breed in standing water, and at least in the Northeast, a wet spring is producing a bumper crop.

A vast arsenal is available for the mosquitophobe. A partial list includes Mosquito Deleto, the Electronic Swatter, Mosquito PowerTrap, Mosquito Terminator, Mosquito Magnet, the Bug Zapper, Mosquito Control Plus, the Solar Mosquito Guard, the Dragonfly Mosquito System, Mosquito 'Cognito, the Sonic Web and Insectivoro. Limited space makes it impractical to list every flowering of the American bug-killing imagination.

Apart from gadgets, there are citronella candles, sprays and lotions galore, synthetic and natural, and clothing impregnated with permethrin. For anyone with a taste for the primitive a full body coat of bear fat or axle grease will discourage both insects and unwanted suitors. So many choices: what's a poor bipedal blood meal to do?

Joseph Conlon has some thoughts on the matter. He is an ex-Navy entomologist who has solved numerous mosquito-related problems, like weaning the Marine Corps from Skin So Soft in the days before it added a new chemical repellent.

He is now the technical adviser to the American Mosquito Control Association and is more than willing to offer advice on mosquito defense. He favors simple, direct action, and is blunt about some of the devices sold widely. ''Don't be taken in by a lot of newfangled gadgets,'' he said.

Instead, he says, you should first ''know your enemy.'' For example, he says he gets calls from homeowners who say, ''I've got these big mosquitoes that are bothering my kids.'' They're actually crane flies, he said, which look like giant mosquitoes but don't sting or bite.

Second, eliminate breeding sources. In other words, depending on the neighborhood you live in, either get rid of the old tires on your front lawn or make sure water isn't accumulating in your terra cotta garden ornaments. For ornamental pools, fish help, or there are chemicals that kill the larvae in water.

Fix your screens, make sure the bugs aren't getting in the house through air conditioners and consider the ultimate sacrifice: stay inside at dusk and early morning when the mosquitoes are most active. If you must go out to greet the dawn use insect repellents and wear loose-fitting clothing.

Mr. Conlon was not favorably disposed toward devices that use light to attract and electricity to fry insects. ''These things are worthless,'' he said. ''Actually they're worse than useless.'' They kill mostly larger, beneficial insects.

An often quoted study by Dr. Douglas W. Tallamy of the University of Delaware found that less than a quarter of a percent of insects killed by such a zapper were mosquitoes and at least 13 percent were beneficial insects. Zappers have undergone some changes, however, and some now use chemicals known to be effective at attracting mosquitoes.

Bats and purple martins are not much better than zappers, Mr. Conlon said. They do eat some mosquitoes, but prefer bigger juicier meals. Anti-mosquito plants are effective at keeping mosquitoes away from themselves, but they won't help you much, he said. And those sonic devices to repel mosquitoes? Tests had shown ''no repellency whatsoever,'' Mr. Conlon said.

Dr. Tallamy concurred. He had not researched them himself, but said, ''there's no physiological basis for them to work, and I've seen no evidence from any study that they work.'' Some frequencies of sound may, however, attract mosquitoes.

There are devices that clearly do lure and kill mosquitoes, although that doesn't mean they'll keep you from getting bitten. Among these are traps that use carbon dioxide and other chemicals to attract mosquitoes, which are then killed by various means, like being trapped until they die of dehydration. Carbon dioxide makes a mosquito think of the warm exhalations of a person relaxing with a book in a hammock, and they follow it. Other chemicals are known to attract them.

''The technology behind these and the theory behind these is really solid,'' Mr. Conlon said. But, how helpful they are in preventing bites depends on the situation. On isolated barrier islands they proved effective in reducing mosquito population. ''In a subdivision they're not going to work as well,'' he said, because the neighborhood will provide a constant new supply.

Dr. Daniel L. Kline, a research entomologist at the Department of Agriculture Center for Medical, Agricultural and Veterinary Entomology in Gainesville, Fla., said the CO2  traps showed promise, but agreed that their effectiveness in the typical suburban yard was unknown. The question is how many mosquitoes you have. If you live near a salt marsh, using one trap would be like trying to empty the ocean with a cup.

Citronella coils and candles are weakly repellent, Mr. Conlon said, but a cloud of smoke from a smudge pot or a cigar will work, if you're willing to let it surround you.

Beyond clearing standing water, navigating the commercial minefield of mosquito gadgets, and staying inside, looms the prospect of protecting your person. Let's say you must venture into the yard, or perhaps you are planning to walk through a swamp in August, or you're a soldier and are being sent to an unpleasant location.

Again, Mr. Conlon does not mince words: ''DEET is still king.'' DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is the active ingredient in most commercial insect repellents. A variety of other substances, natural and synthetic, have some repellent effect, but DEET, said Mr. Conlon, is so far the best. That doesn't mean, however, that you need high concentrations. A 25 to 35 percent concentration is best, he said, the higher concentrations don't provide much added benefit, but simply extend the time of effectiveness.

A report last year in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded that DEET was by far the most effective. The authors were Dr. Mark S. Fradin, a Chapel Hill, N.C., physician, and Dr. John F. Day, a medical entomologist at the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory.

They reported that a 28 percent solution of DEET offered complete protection for about five hours. A ''soybean-oil-based repellent'' worked for about an hour and a half, a formula with a relatively new chemical repellent IR3535 for about 20 minutes, and all other botanical repellents for less than 20 minutes. ''Repellent-impregnated wristbands offered no protection.''

Avon, which has added the repellent IR3535 to its popular lotion, Skin So Soft, rejected the findings of the journal article, saying that laboratory studies are not as effective as field studies.

Although many consumers worry about health effects of insect repellents, the Environmental Protection Agency has declared normal use of DEET products to pose no significant risks for children or adults.

The American Academy of Pediatricians, a private group, takes positions on a variety of health issues that affect children, including the use of DEET. Its most recent advisory suggests that DEET is appropriate for use on children when there is a concern about insect-borne diseases, although children are much less likely than adults to become ill from West Nile virus.

The academy recommends 30 percent as a maximum concentration and suggests using the lowest concentration that will last for the time spent outdoors. Products with 10 percent are effective for about two hours.

The academy's advisory urges parents not to apply DEET more than once a day, also good advice for adults, and not to use a product that combines DEET with a sunscreen.

Some new products may be on the horizon. A new class of repellent, called SS-220, has been patented by scientists working for the Department of Agriculture and is now undergoing toxicity tests.

Dr. Kline's lab is investigating why mosquitoes find some people more attractive than others. There is definitely ''scientific merit,'' he said, to the observations that one family member tends to draw mosquitoes.

Dr. Kline said a colleague at his lab, Dr. Ulrich Bernier, had patented several chemicals given off by unappetizing humans that seem to serve as masking chemicals or inhibitors. Any application of this research would be some way down the line.

A method of personal protection widely used in the military and now sold to consumers is clothing treated with permethrin, an effective insecticide that shouldn't be applied to the skin. With the clothing, you still need to apply a repellent to exposed skin. The Army has other good advice, which everyone should follow. Do not wear dog and cat flea collars, not even on your legs, no matter how bad the bugs are. A June bulletin on pest management from the Army warns against wearing flea and tick collars. ''Animal flea and tick collars are NOT for human use!'' the warning states.

The reason is simple. Dogs and cats don't sweat, but people do. And sweat can release some of the pesticides from the collars so they can be absorbed by the skin.

The precautions the military takes can also be grim. Mr. Conlon recalled that one problem he solved in his military career involved marine recruits at Parris Island, S.C., who were being eaten alive when they assembled at 5:30 a.m.

That, of course, was prime mosquito time. The solution was simple. Move the time up an hour, and have the recruits fall in at 4:30 a.m. After all, why should marines let some insects get a jump on them?

	How to Keep Mosquitoes From Biting


WITH West Nile virus having been detected in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and 30 other states and, as of last month, in all five boroughs of New York City, health officials are urging residents to ratchet up their precautions against mosquitoes.

The lines of defense against mosquitoes range from preventive techniques such as eliminating the pools of water in which they breed to deploying electronic devices to lure and then kill them and, as a final barrier, a skin application that sends them away confused, before they can bite.

''Mosquitoes are reproducing constantly throughout the summer,'' said Dr. Michael Potter, an urban entomologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. ''And their reproductive cycle is very fast. If an adult lays its eggs today, you can have another generation of mosquitoes in a week.''

Dr. Potter said that understanding the life cycle of mosquitoes could help residents exercise some control over how many of the insects they will be exposed to.

He said that the kind of mosquito identified by health officials as the carrier of West Nile virus -- Culex pipiens, the common household mosquito -- typically laid its eggs on the surface of standing water. ''The eggs hatch and in a couple of days the hatchlings turn into wrigglers, the wrigglers turn into tumblers, and then, in another day or two, the tumblers transform into biting adult mosquitoes,'' he said. ''So if you have standing water for longer than three or four days, you've got a potential breeding ground that could soon be teeming with mosquitoes.''

As a result, he said, the most significant action a homeowner can take to control mosquitoes is to eliminate standing water.

''This is often easier said than done since breeding locations are not always obvious,'' Dr. Potter said. Old tires, plastic sheeting, rain gutters, birdbaths, dog dishes, flower pots, puddles, buckets and even boats can all become mosquito factories, he said, if water is allowed to stand in them. But while eliminating unwanted standing water is an effective way to control mosquito populations around a home, some standing water on a property may not necessarily unwanted. ''Ornamental ponds can also become breeding grounds for mosquitoes,'' Dr. Potter said, adding that there were several ways to deal with such areas of standing water.

''Consider stocking ornamental ponds with predacious minnows,'' he said, referring to inch-and-a-half-long minnows also known as mosquito fish. Another approach with ponds is to apply a mosquito-specific insecticide that prevents the mosquito larvae from developing in the water.

Products containing the insect growth-regulating substance methoprene, or the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis var israeliensis, are harmless to fish and other aquatic organisms but lethal to wrigglers and tumblers. (Online retailers of such products -- including Altosid, Mosquito Dunks, Bactimos and Vectobac -- can be found by entering the product name in any search engine.)

Another type of product that can keep ponds from becoming mosquito-breeding grounds but that do not kill the insects directly are substances known as surfactants that coat the top of the water. One such product is Agnique MMF, made by the Cognis Corporation in Cincinnati.

''Agnique MMF uses a nontoxic, physical action to control both disease-carrying and nuisance mosquitoes,'' said Frank Lachut, a senior technical service chemist for the company. Mr. Lachut said that when Agnique was applied to a body of water, the substance spread quickly and completely across the surface, coating it with an invisible, one-molecule-thick film that reduced the water's surface tension. Surface tension, the quality that lets water support a small amount of weight, is critical to mosquito development since mosquito larvae need surface tension to hold their breathing tubes out of the water. ''So when the little wrigglers come up and try to attach to the surface to breathe, they sink instead,'' Mr. Lachut said. ''It basically drowns them.''

Those who are unsuccessful at keeping baby mosquitoes from turning into biting ones have a number of options for dealing with adult mosquitoes. One product is called the Mosquito Magnet. According to Rick Dunne, vice president of sales and marketing for American Biophysics, the device's manufacturer in East Greenwich, R.I., the Mosquito Magnet ''mimics a large mammal by emitting a plume of carbon dioxide, heat and moisture.''

Once an unsuspecting mosquito gets close enough to its presumably attractive target to dine, the Mosquito Magnet vacuums the insect into a net where it dehydrates and dies.

''No electric killing grid or pesticides are used,'' Mr. Dunne said, adding that the product, which sells for $495, uses electricity and propane gas to operate. (Additional information is on American Biophysics' Web site at www.mosquitomagnet.com.)

Another device designed to attract and trap adult mosquitoes is the SonicWeb Biting Insect Control, manufactured by Applica Consumer Products in Miami Lakes, Fla.

''The SonicWeb is the first mosquito control device that is sound driven,'' said Chris Mitchell, a spokesman for the company. ''When I say it's sound driven, I mean that we're using sound as the long-range attractant. It's sort of like a decoy in that we're mimicking a mammal's heartbeats with low-frequency sound.'' The product, which Mr. Mitchell said would provide control over about an acre, uses a glue-coated trap to catch curious mosquitoes. (The SonicWeb costs $300 and is available at some larger department stores.)

A less sophisticated method involves killing mosquitoes outright with pesticides. Dr. Potter, the entomologist, said that since adult mosquitoes liked to rest in dense vegetation during the day, it might be possible to reduce their numbers by applying insecticides to the lower limbs of shade trees and to shrubs and shaded areas around foundations.

Products containing pyrethroids, he said, are generally most effective and can be efficiently applied using a garden hose attached to a special sprayer on the bottle. Among the pyrethroid-based products available in home and garden centers are Ortho Bug-Be-Gone Ready Spray, Bayer Advanced Powerforce Multi-Insect Killer and Spectracide Triazicide Soil and Turf Insect Killer.

(Dr. Potter added that things like citronella candles and bug zappers -- those backyard gadgets that attract mosquitoes with ultraviolet light and electrocute them loudly -- were only marginally effective, at best. ''Studies indicate that less than 5 percent of the mosquitoes killed by bug zappers are females, the only ones that actually bite,'' he said. ''The rest are nonbiting, male mosquitoes and other harmless night-flying insects.'' Citronella candles, he said, are better at providing atmosphere than repelling mosquitoes.)

The last line of defense is barricading oneself indoors and making sure all windows and doors have screens. Those who venture outside might want to use topically applied mosquito repellents. Dr. Jonathan Day, a professor of medical entomology at the University of Florida Research Lab in Vero Beach, said the most effective topically applied mosquito repellent is a chemical known as diethyl toluamide, or DEET.

''DEET is the gold standard that all other repellents are compared to,'' Dr. Day said, adding that the chemical was used in a number of over-the-counter insect repellents.

He said that different products had different concentrations of DEET. Those with higher concentrations, he said, are not necessarily better at repelling mosquitoes, but will repel mosquitoes for longer than those with lower concentrations. So a product that contains 8 percent DEET will last for two to three hours, while a repellent with 30 percent DEET will last six to eight hours.

And how does DEET work? ''The present theory is that all biting insects use exhaled carbon dioxide to find you,'' Dr. Day said, adding that rather than smell the carbon dioxide, mosquitoes detect it through receptors on their legs and antennae. ''Well, it looks like DEET also stimulates those receptors,'' Dr. Day said. ''But once they touch the DEET, they go into overstimulus mode.''

While DEET is not really a repellent, he said -- mosquitoes typically touch skin DEET is on -- once they get it on their legs or antennae, they become so overstimulated they lose interest in their prey. ''The mosquito is on total information overload,'' he said. ''It will just fly away, land someplace, and sit there doing nothing for two or three hours.''

	Science's Elusive Realm: Life's Little Mysteries


Physicists observe the natural world and extract from it laws and principles that reliably explain everyday phenomena. At the smallest scale, they use quantum mechanics to predict the behavior of subatomic particles and small molecules. At larger scales, they devise theories to explain magnetism, the conduction of heat and electricity and other phenomena that occur the same way in a wide variety of materials.

Scientists boast that these principles predict how most matter will behave in physical and chemical experiments.

But there is one region that eludes them. That is the region containing matter on a scale of 10 to 1,000 angstroms (an angstrom being one billionth of a meter) -- bigger than a simple molecule but smaller than a living cell. This is the realm in which the constituents of cells interact with one another.

It is where proteins fold, charged ions move through cell membranes and messenger molecules read DNA instructions in the cell nucleus. Even the most advanced microscopes can only glimpse this activity, because the energies they use tend to destroy living tissue, said Dr. David Pines, a physicist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

At this level, things do not act according to well-described theories of chemistry and physics. Rather, systems this size seem to obey a unique set of rules that cannot be deduced from studying their individual components.

There are too many atoms in the systems to be described by electromagnetism and quantum theories but too few to handle statistically.

This is the realm of ''the mesoscale,'' and scientists like Dr. Pines and Dr. Robert Laughlin, the Nobel laureate from Stanford, are attacking its mysteries.

''I think we'll see some answers,  but it will take a generation or two,'' Dr. Laughlin said in a recent interview. ''It won't happen tomorrow.''

Work has begun under the auspices of the Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter or ICAM, a new and independent unit of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of California at Berkeley,  which administers the lab. Led by Dr. Pines and Dr. Laughlin, the physicists, chemists and biologists of ICAM met here this year to discuss how scientists might try to understand and maybe even design matter that organizes itself into living systems.

Unlike the Santa Fe Institute and other centers that study complexity, ICAM scientists tend to shun computer models and the jargon of complex systems. Nor do they have much faith in efforts to understand life by sequencing genes and looking for similar patterns in different organisms.

Without deeper organizing principles, they say, the mere accumulation and organization of genetic data will not shed light on how life works.

Research on the mesoscale must be based on experiments, Dr. Laughlin said. ''It's about making stuff, putting matter into new situations so you may discover something new. Then you do your best to disprove your theory. Physics teaches us that rules dreamt up without the benefit of physical insight are nearly always wrong. Correct rules must be discovered, not invented.''

As an example, he cites 19th century physicists who believed light needed some kind of medium, called ether, to spread through the universe. But this wholly fabricated invention was overturned when Albert Einstein accepted at face value experiments that found light travels at a constant speed and ''went on to make his astonishing predictions about the dilation of time and the equivalence of mass and energy, both of which have now been verified in countless experiments,'' Dr. Laughlin said.

Nanotechnology is exploring matter at the mesoscale and holds promise for discovering new principles, Dr. Laughlin said. But until it develops some theories, it will not be able to test new ideas about how living systems are organized. Mathematicians are beginning to make important contributions that help model and understand biological systems, he said, but laboratory experiments still need to guide their thinking.

To start with, ICAM researchers are focusing on one beguiling fact: complex systems can arise out of simple constituents that interact with each other in ways not necessarily obvious.

In Dr. Laughlin's view, life is constructed according to engineering principles or laws that do not change, though they are observed at different scales under different conditions, Dr. Laughlin said. For example, the laws of hydrodynamics -- the science that deals with the motions of fluids and the forces acting on solid bodies immersed in fluids -- are the same in a wide variety of materials. Do these so-called ''protected'' laws exist at the mesoscale? No one attending the ICAM meeting claimed to have the answer. But they discussed a variety of ways to find out.

One approach involves studying the way small molecules called amino acids fold themselves up to make functional proteins. When a gene directs messenger RNA to make a protein, it activates machinery that produces a linear chain of amino acids that code for the protein. Scientists used to think that the same linear sequence of amino acids always led to the same protein, said Dr. Peter Wolynes, a chemist at the University of California at San Diego. They also thought that proteins followed more or less the same course when they folded.

But now, Dr. Wolynes said, scientists know that a huge variety of amino acid sequences can fold up to form the same protein. Moreover, the same string of amino acids fol ded differently creates a protein that acts differently in the body. These findings have turned protein folding into one of the most intractable problems in biology. For example, a big protein like myoglobin, the iron-bearing pigment in muscles, can be made by any one of many millions of different amino acid sequences.

What makes a protein follow one of these many folding possibilities to achieve its functional shape? The answer, Dr. Wolynes said, lies in what he and other researchers call ''funnels'' in the multidimensional landscape of folding possibilities.  Like real funnels that force material to flow in one direction, protein funnels are produced when amino acids try many different configurations and are drawn by an interplay of positive and negative forces to flow or fold in one direction.

But the detailed physical interactions that may create these funnels are not well understood.

Dr. James Shapiro, a professor of microbiology at the University of Chicago and an ICAM researcher, said that interactions among components in a system were the keys to understanding the emergence of complex systems.

These interactions include dynamic properties like feedback and checkpoints, at which the system checks to make sure everything is all right, which are seen everywhere in living cells, he said. All kinds of signals inform cells where they are at a given time, where their neighbors are, what they are supposed to do next and how and when to stop, Dr. Shapiro said.

Feedback and control are processes that lead to protected states in the mesoscale, which need to be explored experimentally. Dr. M. Reza  Ghadiri, a chemist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego has in his laboratory created small systems of organic molecules that faithfully make copies of themselves and use feedback to change their dynamics.

These molecular ecosystems are not life, he said, but they do show emergent properties like the ability to reproduce, form parasites, correct errors and engage in symbiosis.

Dr. Laughlin challenged biologists to double-check some of their classic experiments used to explain how DNA works at a molecular level. For example, many details of accepted theories of how DNA actually makes proteins are ''appallingly bad,'' he said.

''I've just written a paper on this subject, which is considered nutty by many experts and visionary by others,'' he said. He said it would be published soon in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and added that he welcomed vigorous debate about it.

At Harvard, Dr. George Whitesides is experimenting with magnetite and iron beads to explore how forces of repulsion, attraction and energy dissipation interact to form unpredictable complex patterns. As these simple systems evolve, Dr. Whitesides said, it should be possible to explore the dynamics of interacting particles and perhaps model biological principles.

''We are letting nature tell us what it likes to do,'' he said. Such experiments have extraordinary implications, Dr. Pines said. Unlike vitalism -- a doctrine that says the processes of life are not explicable by the laws of physics and chemistry alone and that life is in some way self-determining -- the research into complex adaptive matter says that life is the consequence of molecular interactions.

''If we can discover organizing principles in biology other than evolution, it means we will be able to make living systems in the laboratory,'' Dr. Pines said. ''We can understand how life began.''

Correction:  April 25, 2001, Wednesday  An article in Science Times yesterday about a new effort to understand the behavior of matter bigger than a simple molecule but smaller than a living cell -- at the mesoscale, the scale of 10 to 1,000 angstroms -- defined an angstrom incorrectly. It is one ten-billionth of a meter, not a billionth of a meter.

	SCIENTIST AT WORK/Jacqueline Barton


Like many a bio-minded scientist in this gilded age of the genome, Dr. Jacqueline K. Barton, a professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology here, considers the double helix so aesthetically pleasing that she keeps a chubby, cheery model of it smack in the middle of her office table.

The three-foot-high sculpturette of some 20 base pairs of DNA -- a tiny fraction of the 3 billion nucleic building blocks that make up the human genome -- has a sort of Henry Moore bulbosity to it, coupled with the graceful, emergent torque of the Venus de Milo. All very sinusoidal and maternal: just what one would expect of the famed Molecule of Life and the mother of all cookbooks.

Yet as Dr. Barton speaks of her studies about how DNA might keep itself fit and fiery by shooting electrons up and down its span, the familiar object on her table begins to evoke a very different image: that of a lightning bolt, a crackling zigzag of opportunity. Far from being a couch-bound custodian of information, it seems, the molecule of life is the original live wire.

''What many people don't realize is how dynamic the structure of DNA is,'' said Dr. Barton, her fingers fluttering lightly over the model. ''The base pairs are always moving and vibrating, electrons are migrating, holes are opening up and closing through the center of the DNA.'' It's like a cocktail party or a kindergarten class, she said. ''Nothing stays still for more than a femtosecond here or a millisecond there.''

Yet for all the squirm and spark, DNA, the ultimate source of information on how cells and bodies should behave, remains a remarkably stable presence throughout one's terrestrial tenure, and even beyond. It's because the molecule is so substantive and slow to degrade, said Dr. Barton, ''that you can still look at dinosaur DNA.''

Dr. Barton, 51, and her colleagues are seeking to understand just how the double helix manages to be at once so twitchy and so reliable, capable of constant interchange with tens of thousands of proteins and other small characters in the cell, hammered at by blistering chemicals, ultraviolet rays and corrosive free radicals, and expected to split and split and split again, spawning numberless generations of daughter DNA molecules in the course of cell division; and all the while still staying sane and functional and relatively error-free.

Dr. Barton proposes that the DNA molecule polices itself electronically, periodically delivering a flow of charged particles from Point A to Point B to check for mutant, misplaced bases that might be skulking in the corridors. If the electrons proceed unimpeded, she suggests, all is well. But if there is a kink in the sequence, the smallest sign of a nascent mutation, the flow would short-circuit. That break would in turn sound an alarm, alerting the cell's DNA repair crew to fix the mess now, or at least sometime before lunch.

The work is part of Dr. Barton's larger exploration of the electrical properties of DNA, and how the trafficking of charged particles in and around its zigs, swags and crevasses may help mold the contours of the master macro-molecule or set its timbre twanging.

Dr. Barton is a heavy-metal fan. She and her lab mates have created metal-studded molecular probes that allow them to generate electrons when and where they want them, and to follow the migration of the particles as they ping their way through DNA. By taking an electron's eye view of the double helix, she hopes to help solve a mystery of molecular biology: how all the tens of thousands of tiny proteins responsible for servicing the genome and carrying out its encoded directives find their correct genetic targets along an otherwise forbidding spaghetti of chromosomal coils.

On a practical note, Dr. Barton has designed tiny metal-based probes to test the integrity of a given DNA sample as quickly and cheaply as possible. A company that she founded in San Diego, GeneOhm Sciences Inc., is now working to translate some of her ideas into a simple laboratory assay that could detect disease mutations in a patient's DNA by simply running a current through it and seeing if anything trips it up.

Such a procedure would be much simpler than using biochemical methods to spell out, or sequence, thousands of DNA subunits in search of the occasional miscreant. Her work is also attracting attention from experts in the fashionable field of nanotechnology, the science of the extremely tiny, who would dearly love to exploit nature's microcircuitry in devices of their own.

Dr. Barton has long been a high-wattage figure on the chemistry circuit. She is a MacArthur fellow, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a winner of laurels from the National Science Foundation, the American Chemical Society and the American Philosophical Society, to name a few.

Like the molecule she studies, Dr. Barton is a braid of contradictions: animated and composed, optimistic and pragmatic, genial and driven. ''If the house were to burn down, if things were going badly in the lab, if a paper wasn't accepted by the right journal, she wouldn't get angry or frustrated or wear it on her sleeve, the way I might,'' said Dr. Peter Dervan, 58, her husband and also a professor of chemistry at Caltech.

Dr. Barton is compact, dark-eyed, dark-haired, and, true to her New York roots, she likes dressing in black. She walks briskly, as nearly all scientists do, but with a decided bounce in her step. ''What can I say?'' said Dr. Robert G. Shulman, an emeritus professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry at Yale. ''We were all jealous of her husband when they got married.''

As one of the very few women ranking as a full professor at Caltech, and in the chemistry trade generally, Dr. Barton has perhaps inevitably become a role model to young women in science. Later this month, for example, she is participating in the first Rosalind Franklin International Lecture Program at the Imperial College in Britain, devised ''to expose young scientists'' to that wondrous sight, ''internationally recognized women scientists.''

Dr. Shana Kelley, an assistant professor of chemistry at Boston College, said, ''I tell people she's found out how to do it all, that you don't have to choose between career or family, and that's what I want for myself.''

''I might have had more doubts if I hadn't watched her,'' she added.

Dr. Anna Marie Pyle, a professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry at Yale who studied under Dr. Barton, said: ''Jackie conveys to her students the importance of creativity and imagination in science. Women need to have somebody express confidence in their creative abilities, not just their ability to work harder.''

The good life has its grindstones and metronomes, though. The couple's time is so tightly scheduled, admitted Dr. Dervan, ''that I can tell you where we'll be to the day, to the hour, for the next 12 months.''

When they are at work, they work, and when they are at home, they are parents. (They have two children -- Elizabeth, 13, and Andrew, 21, Dr. Dervan's son from his first marriage.)

''People assume that because Peter and I are both chemists, we talk all the time about chemistry,'' said Dr. Barton. ''In fact, we almost never talk shop. If we go out to dinner together, we talk about Elizabeth.''

They travel often for work, but they are zealously efficient in those jaunts. Dr. Barton has been known to fly back and forth to Europe in a single day, alighting abroad just long enough to deliver a two-hour talk. ''Who wants to sleep in a hotel alone,'' she said, ''when you can sleep at home with your family?''

One of the few things that gets her ever so wryly ruffled is the public's attitude toward her beloved discipline, chemistry. ''People hear the word 'chemical' and they automatically think it's bad,'' she said. ''Even my daughter, when she was in kindergarten, came home and said she'd learned that there were too many chemicals in the world. I told her, Elizabeth, we're all chemicals! Everything is made of chemicals!''

Dr. Barton is also skeptical whenever laypeople tell her they ''flunked chemistry'' in high school. ''Not everybody could possibly have flunked chemistry,'' she said. ''Surely someone somewhere got a B.''

For that matter, she said, why do people so readily confess to their complete ignorance of chemistry and other science, even to the point of sounding boastful? ''People are perfectly willing to say to me at a party, I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about, which they would never do if we were discussing current events,'' she said. ''Why aren't they embarrassed? Why don't they think, Gee, maybe this is something I ought to know a little bit about?'' Fear is no excuse. For all its daunting reputation, she said: ''Science really isn't that hard. I don't think it's more difficult than anything else.''

Born and raised in New York City, she attended the Riverdale Country School for Girls. Back then, she said, ''young girls didn't take chemistry.''

The first chemistry course she took was in college, at Barnard. It became her major; she graduated summa cum laude. She earned her Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry from Columbia, and did a postdoctoral fellowship at Bell Labs and Yale. Dr. Barton then took a position as assistant professor of chemistry at Hunter College in New York.

She soon moved to Columbia, where her research using metal ions to study DNA began attracting considerable attention, from her future husband, among others. She and Dr. Dervan knew each other for years professionally before they began dating, and when Caltech sought to woo Dr. Barton from Columbia, she told the recruiters of the potentially confounding fact that she was in love with a member of their faculty. ''Their response was, well, that's further incentive for you to come here,'' Dr. Dervan said.

Soon after moving to Caltech, Dr. Barton gave birth to her daughter, and within short order learned of her MacArthur ''genius'' award. ''That came at a good time for me,'' she said. ''I was wondering if people might think, oh, she's a mother now, is she going to start slowing down? The MacArthur gave me the reassurance that I was probably O.K., and that I could go on to do interesting stuff.''

So long as it doesn't require an overnight stay.

	Bush Policy on Human Stem Cells Faces New Challenges


The White House's policy on research with human embryonic stem cells has been put under new pressure by the dismissal of a leading biologist from the President's Council on Bioethics last week and by the development, announced today, of new stem cell lines by a Harvard researcher.

At present, researchers who receive government financing can only work with human embryonic stem lines that were derived from embryos before 9 p.m. on Aug. 9, 2001.

This was a political compromise that allowed stem cell research to begin but that also assured opponents of abortion that no more very early embryos would be destroyed.

Dr. Douglas Melton, a biologist at Harvard, reported today in The New England Journal of Medicine that he had developed 17 new human stem cell lines with private money and would make them available to other researchers.

But scientists who are supported by government grants -- the vast bulk of biomedical researchers -- cannot use the cell lines because they were derived after the White House cutoff date. An editorial in the journal says that Dr. Melton's cell lines ''should become part'' of the approved list of lines registered by the National Institutes of Health.

Almost all scientists agree that if the promise of human embryonic stem cells is realized and they prove to be a universal repair kit for patching up impaired body tissues, many new cell lines will need to be derived.

A critical question is whether the health institutes' registry now includes enough cell lines for researchers to establish whether or not the cells can be used to treat disease. Dr. Melton said that he did not know for sure whether research was being impeded by the present constraints, but that he had to develop his own lines, a choice not open to researchers without private money.

Dr. Ron McKay, a stem cell researcher at the institutes of health, said the agency's cell lines had so far proven suitable for his research, including a project to develop cells for treating Parkinson's disease. But he added that if the project reached the clinical stage, perhaps in two years, it would be necessary to derive new and more appropriate cells.

''It will become obvious that there are cell lines out there that have therapeutic value and it will be morally impossible to support the case that you shouldn't be using them,'' Dr. McKay said.

The agency is trying to support research on human embryonic stem cells to the full extent they can within the law, and there is no cap on research money for the field, said Dr. James Battey, chairman of the agency's panel on stem cells.

Of the 78 cell lines the institutes originally ascertained had been created before the August 2001 cutoff date, 15 have been developed and are available and another 8 should come on line soon. Of the others, The Washington Post reported yesterday, 16 lines have proven not to be viable. Dr. Battey said that kind of failure was completely expected in cell line research.

When asked by a reporter what the institutes would do, if and when scientists proved that the method worked and needed to develop new cell lines, Dr. Battey said, ''When we come to that bridge, we will jump off it.''

Last week, two members of the President's Council on Bioethics, which advises on stem cell research and other issues, were told that their two-year terms would not be renewed. Their dismissal was protested in a letter sent to President Bush by Dr. Arthur Caplan, an ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania and 131 others. One of the two departing members, Dr. William F. May of the University of Virginia, issued a statement saying he had not expected to serve again and praising the chairman, Dr. Leon Kass, for his evenhandedness.

The other member, Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn of the University of California, San Francisco, attributed her dismissal to the fact that she had strongly dissented from some of the council's positions.

''He doesn't like his authority to be questioned,'' she said of Dr. Kass. Dr. Blackburn is a leading cell biologist and one of the founders of an important new field to do with the structure of chromosomes.

Dr. Kass declined to comment, but referred reporters to an article he wrote in yesterday's Washington Post, in which he stated that Dr. Blackburn's replacement was not political and not connected with any dissent she had expressed inside the council.

	Promise, in Search of Results; Stem Cell Science Gets Limelight; Now It Needs a Cure


At three laboratories here, separated by a taxi ride of no more than 10 or 15 minutes, the world of stem cell research can be captured in all its complexity, promise and diversity.

One of the labs focuses on cells taken from human embryos, another on cells from mice and fish, and a third from stem cells that have mysteriously survived in the adult body long after their original mission is over.

But while the work here and elsewhere has touched off a debate reaching into the presidential campaign, a tour through these labs shows that the progress of research is both greater and less than it seems from a distance.

One idea, the focus of about half the nation's stem cell research, involves studying stem cells that are naturally present in adults. Researchers have found such cells in a variety of tissues and organs and say they seem to be a part of the body's normal repair mechanism. There are no ethical issues in studying these cells, but the problem is in putting them to work to treat diseases. So far, no one has succeeded.

The other line of research, with stem cells from embryos, has a different obstacle. Although, in theory, the cells could be coaxed into developing into any of the body's specialized cells, so far scientists are still working on ways to direct their growth in the laboratory and they have not yet effectively cured diseases, even in animals.

The most progress with embryonic stem cells is in mice, where one group of researchers directed the cells to grow into a variety of blood cells, but not yet the ones they want. Another group directed mouse stem cells to grow into nerve cells and tried to use them to treat Parkinson's disease in mice. The nerve cells produced the missing chemical, dopamine, but not enough to cure the disease.

As the two lines of research proceed along parallel paths, researchers say it is far too soon to bet on which, if either, will yield cures first. ''It's not either-or,'' said Dr. Diana Bianchi, chief of the division of medical genetics at Tufts New England Medical Center in Boston.

At the medical center, Dr. Bianchi says, her foray into the world of stem cell research involved a decade of discoveries so unexpected that despite her stellar reputation, colleagues at first looked askance.

Dr. Bianchi, who works in a lab stretched out along a narrow corridor of an old building that was once a garment factory, stumbled into the field when she was trying to find a new method of prenatal diagnosis.

She knew that a few fetal cells enter a woman's blood during pregnancy and hoped to extract those cells for prenatal diagnosis. That proved too difficult because there are so few fetal cells in maternal blood.

But then she discovered that the fetal cells do not disappear when a pregnancy ends. Instead, they remain in a woman's body for decades, perhaps indefinitely. And if a woman's tissues or organs are injured, fetal cells from her baby migrate there, divide and turn into the needed cell type, be it thyroid or liver, intestine or gallbladder, cervix or spleen.

She and her colleagues find fetal cells by looking for male cells in tissues and organs of women who have been pregnant with boys and showing that the cells' DNA matches that of the women's sons or, if the women had abortions, their male fetuses. (Cells from female fetuses also enter a woman's body, but it is quicker and easier to find the male cells by looking for cells with a Y chromosome, Dr. Bianchi says.)

One woman, for example had hepatitis C, a viral infection. But when her liver repaired itself, it used cells that were not her own.

''Her entire liver was repopulated with male cells,'' Dr. Bianchi said.

Such findings astonished even Dr. Bianchi. But now, with publications in leading journals, including, last month, The Journal of the American Medical Association, few doubt her.

In theory, fetal cells lurking in a woman's body are the equivalent of a new source of stem cells and could be stimulated to treat diseases. But, Dr. Bianchi says, she does not yet know for sure that the cells are stem cells -- she must isolate them and prove they can turn into any of the body's specialized cells -- nor where the cells reside, or how, short of injury, to spur them to action.

Using Mice and Fish, for Now

A short distance away, Dr. Leonard Zon, the chief of stem cell research at Children's Hospital, and his colleague Dr. George Q. Daley are working with stem cells from embryos, using mice and zebra fish for now. They want to learn how to transform the stem cells into immature blood cells that will divide and replenish themselves.

Then, if they can apply their work to human embryonic stem cells, they want to use the cells instead of bone marrow transplants to treat patients with genetic disorders like sickle cell anemia, and inborn disorders of the immune system.

Dr. Zon treats children with these diseases, most of whom do not have a relative whose cells match theirs closely enough to serve as a bone marrow donor. He urgently wants to help.

But he is not there yet. So far, in research that stem cell investigators say is among the most promising in the field, Dr. Zon and Dr. Daley have turned mouse embryonic stem cells into mouse blood cells. Those blood cells, however, are more mature than the ones they need, a particular type of early blood cells that can repopulate a patient's bone marrow and survive indefinitely. Ones that are more mature live out their lifespans and die within weeks.

They are also working with human embryonic stem cells, venturing into the most controversial area of stem cell work. Human embryonic stem cells are derived from human embryos, about a week old, and the only way to get the stem cells is to destroy the embryos.

Some human stem cells came from embryos that were donated by couples at fertility labs who had embryos left over after they decided their families were complete. Others came from embryos that were created to obtain stem cells; researchers paid women to donate eggs, fertilized them and let them grow to the stage where stem cells could be extracted.

The federal government has agreed to pay for research with human stem cells, but only for work with 22 lines; each line is the progeny of a single embryo. That restriction dates from Aug. 9, 2001, when President Bush issued a directive saying the government would pay for research, but only with cell lines created before that date.

Dr. James F. Battey, director of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and chairman of the National Institute of Health's stem cell task force, said scientists were free to study other stem cell lines if they used private money. He understands the researchers' complaints that it would be better if the government paid for work on more lines, but, he said, as far as the federal government is concerned, ''the argument isn't solely about science.''

''What the president has already said on multiple occasions is that he is committed to the notion that taxpayers' money should not be used to encourage the destruction of human embryos,'' Dr. Battey said. ''This is a White House policy.''

And, he said, ''it is not based solely on the needs of the scientific community.''

But Dr. Zon said being able to work on more human stem cell lines could help the research.

''When you are trying to do research, you look for every advantage you can,'' he said. ''Some embryonic stem cell lines make particular tissues better than others.''

Some, for example, might more easily turn into blood cells, and others might more easily grow into nerve cells, but there is no way to know whether there is a better stem cell line for a particular cell type without trying as many as possible, Dr. Zon said. ''You would want to find the line that makes the tissue you are studying.''

An Embryo by Cloning

Across the river in Cambridge, in the basement of a biology building on Harvard's campus, a small group of scientists works in a two-room lab on the site of a former machine shop. Among their goals is to plunge into one of the most controversial areas of stem cell research -- creating human embryos by cloning and obtaining stem cells from those embryos.

An embryo created by cloning would be an exact genetic match of the person whose cells were used to make it. Its stem cells and any mature cells derived from those stem cells would exactly match the cells in the person's body, making them perfect replacement cells.

One of the four part-time researchers at the Harvard lab, Dr. Kevin Eggan, learned to clone mice as a Ph.D. student at M.I.T. and, he said, the group is seeking approval from Harvard's ethics committee to try to start the cloning process with human cells.

The federal government forbids the use of its money to pay for such research, but this lab, directed by Dr. Douglas A. Melton, a Harvard developmental biologist, takes no federal money. Instead, the work is paid for by the Howard Hughes Foundation, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and the Naomi Berry Diabetes Center of Columbia University.

Cloning, however, can be onerous. In February, researchers in South Korea announced that they gotten stem cells from human embryos they created by cloning, but they began with 176 human eggs and ended up with one embryo that yielded stem cells.

Dr. Eggan, though, is not after replacement cells. His goal in cloning is to understand what goes wrong in a disease like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or diabetes.

Dr. Melton gave an example. Suppose he had stem cells that were exact matches of 50 patients with Parkinson's disease and directed them to grow in the laboratory into nerve cells of the type that die in the disease. He could then ask when, and why, the cells die.

''Do they all show a defect at the same stage? If so, that would mean there is a common cause, like a flat tire. Or maybe each one breaks down in a different way. Is there one way to get Parkinson's, or 50 ways?'' Dr. Melton asked.

''We could use that information to do drug screening,'' he added, possibly finding ways to prevent the nerve cell death.

For now, though, the Harvard lab is becoming a supplier to the world of its own 17 lines of human embryonic stem cells, created without cloning, and made from 286 frozen embryos created by in vitro fertilization.

Realism About Treatments

Meanwhile the national debate over the use of human embryonic stem cells goes on.

While many Americans say in polls that they favor using these cells, many others have strong moral objections. Creating and destroying a human embryo to obtain stem cells, they say, is ethically unacceptable, and doing research on human embryonic stem cell lines that are already in existence does not right the wrong.

It is ''a kind of after-the-fact cooperation with this destruction,'' said Richard Doerflinger, deputy director of pro-life activities for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

The challenge for scientists in the midst of a fierce political debate, many say, is to be realistic about how hard it is to develop treatments.

Dr. Battey lists some of the challenges ahead: getting the cells to develop into exactly the adult cells that are needed, demonstrating that the adult cells can survive, preventing rejection and controlling cell growth.

Such issues, Dr. Battey said, ''need to be addressed in animal models before any thoughtful person would go into humans.''

Correction:  August 31, 2004, Tuesday  An article in Science Times last Tuesday about the complexities of stem cell research misspelled the name of a diabetes center that helps finance research by Dr. Douglas A. Melton, a Harvard developmental biologist. It is the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center of Columbia University, not Berry.

	A Doctor for The Future


Dr. D. Holmes Morton stood at the front of the red-and-white-striped tent set up in a farm pasture in Lancaster County, Pa. Behind him were a horse and a buggy -- his host's main mode of transportation -- and a whitewashed barn and silo. To his left was a sunken barbecue pit, with 60 chickens cooking inside a homemade wire-mesh spit. Before him were seven families, upward of 50 people. The women wore bonnets and aprons, the men, long pants and long sleeves, in keeping with their Mennonite ways. Many of the youngest were in wheelchairs. One teenage girl had her left heel in her mouth. A boy was chewing on the handout Morton had distributed. It was two pages long and titled ''Pretzel Syndrome.''

The families had gathered here at the Weaver farm on this sticky July afternoon so that Morton could tell them what was wrong with their children. He could not give them a scientific name for their disease, because it did not have one yet. Morton and his team had discovered the existence of this illness only a few weeks earlier. Nor could he tell them how to cure it, or how to ease its symptoms, or what the future held for their kids -- though he said he hoped that would come in time. All he could tell them then was why -- why their children looked different, and had seizures, and could not speak, and died young. Why the youngsters' joints were so elastic that they could rest their feet behind their heads, their bodies twisted like pretzels. The cause, he could say with brand-new certainty, lay in their genes.

Morton, his gray hair blending with his faded jeans and herringbone jacket, his bow tie untied and draped around his neck, is a glimpse of the medicine of the future. And that future does not look the way we once thought it would. It has been five years since the first rough draft of the human-genome map was completed, five years since President Clinton predicted that ''with this profound new knowledge, humankind is on the verge of gaining immense new power to heal.'' At the time, scientists told us they would soon be able to tinker with our DNA, repair our imperfect chromosomes and eliminate inherited disease. Gene therapy would be like penicillin, they said -- a significant breakthrough, a complete cure.

That has not happened yet, and it is not likely to happen any time soon. ''The enthusiasm has dimmed,'' says Dr. David Ginsburg, a professor of medical genetics at the University of Michigan. ''Many in the field have been accused of overhyping it.''

But while all eyes were fixed in recent years on the gene-therapy prize, a quieter transformation has been taking place. From a single drop of blood, scientists can now read our DNA -- looking for which genes are present or missing, intact or broken, making diagnoses of disorders that were once either unheard-of, uncertain or misunderstood. From that they have been able to begin to decipher the consequences for a patient's life, longevity and health -- a process some have taken to calling ''genomic medicine.'' ''This really is the future,'' says Edward R.B. McCabe, co-director of the University of California at Los Angeles Center for Society and Genetics. ''Genomic medicine will be predictive, preventive and personalized,'' meaning that treatment will be shaped by, and tailored to, each patient's DNA. Perhaps doctors won't be able to fix genes, he says, but ''it won't be enough to just diagnose'' either. The time is past for knowledge for knowledge's sake, he says. ''You have to use that information to help the patient.''

Eventually doctors will be able to do that for all patients. Does heart disease run in your family? Your genes will one day reveal your personal risk in intricate detail. Is your genetic legacy Alzheimer's? Diabetes? Stroke? We're nearing the day when a quick blood test can refine your odds and allow you to prevent or mitigate what's etched in your DNA.

At the moment, though, this genetic approach to medicine applies mostly to clusters of rare disorders, ones caused by a single gene, making them easier to identify and, because they occur in a limited population, easier to study. And no doctor in the country treats more of those than Holmes Morton. Among his 700 pediatric patients, there are more than 60 rare disorders, making his practice, in the farmlands of Pennsylvania, both a model and a test of medicine as it will eventually be. In time, all patients will come to understand genes as clearly as they now understand germs. Morton's patients already do. Someday soon, patients will expect that doctors will look into their genes as surely as they look down their throats. Morton's patients are used to that, too. Eventually new parents will assume that their babies will be given a battery of tests at birth, screening for every possible disorder. Morton's patients are almost there.

Medicine combined completely and seamlessly with genetics is so unformed at the moment that it doesn't really have a name. Some universities have departments of ''human genetics'' and ''molecular medicine,'' though the former term implies research rather than treatment, and the latter connotes medicine on the cellular level, not the DNA level. Other schools use the term ''medical genetics,'' which is the name of the board-certified specialty, but Dr. Victor A. McKusick, who is known as the father of the entire field for his studies dating back to the 1950's, says the description is obsolete. He prefers ''genetic medicine,'' as in ''the McKusickNathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at Johns Hopkins,'' which was named after him. '''Medical genetics' conjures up visions of rare diseases that are only of interest to a few people,'' he says. '''Genetic medicine' tells it the way it is. Genetics pervades all of medicine. It is starting with the rare conditions that Holmes is seeing. But it involves hypertension, it involves heart disease, it involves us all.''

McCabe, at U.C.L.A., is among those who think that even the newer term ''genetic medicine'' is too limited in that it is used to describe genetic counseling and prenatal testing. Prediction (testing carriers, testing embryos), with its labyrinth of ethical dilemmas, is a different realm than treatment, so this label is lacking, too. McCabe uses the term ''genomic medicine'' to describe the implied promise of treatment in the mapped genome.

Whatever it is called, it is taking root in Lancaster County, home to one of the nation's largest populations of Old Order Amish and Mennonites. Genetically these are two separate groups with some shared culture and beliefs whom history brought to the same place. To outsiders, the Amish are the men with the beards and the Mennonites are the men without. Both separate themselves from the modern world, which they call ''the English,'' shunning technology, taking their children out of school after eighth grade, never becoming doctors or scientists, rather farmers and craftsmen.

At first, the juxtaposition seems a paradox -- this simple culture being treated at Morton's high-tech clinic, which sits literally in the middle of an alfalfa field in Strasburg, Pa. But look more closely, and it makes perfect sense. These groups, known collectively as the Plain People, have long been entwined with genetic research in the United States. Because members keep to themselves and marry within their communities, they rarely get to shuffle their genetic decks, and they are afflicted with a wide variety of rare diseases in far greater frequency than the population as a whole. For more than 30 years, genetic researchers have flocked here to study them, identifying the mutations that cause dozens of disorders by using samples of Amish and Mennonite blood. (McKusick's groundbreaking book, ''Medical Genetic Studies of the Amish,'' was published back in 1978.) Most researchers, though, swoop in from their universities, collect their samples, then return to their labs. Morton is the first who has stayed, not just researching but also treating -- taking tomorrow's health care to a world that lives in yesterday.

''Think of the rest of medicine trying to catch up with people in a horse and buggy,'' says G. Terry Sharrer, a curator of health sciences for the Smithsonian Institution, who has spent time studying Morton's clinic. ''We think of molecular medicine as being far off in the future. Well, molecular medicine is being practiced in an alfalfa field in Strasburg.''

Friends and colleagues describe him as a cross between Albert Einstein, Albert Schweitzer and the doctor in a Norman Rockwell painting, but back in his teens, Holmes Morton was a high-school dropout who wanted to be a writer. Born 55 years ago in Fayetteville, W.Va., then a town of 2,000 people, he figured he would have more to write about if he saw the world, so he spent six years as a boilerman and engineman in the Merchant Marines and the Navy. He read voraciously during those years, then talked his way into Trinity College and went on to Harvard Medical School. (When he won the prestigious Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism for his work in Lancaster County, in 1993, his high school awarded him an honorary diploma.) Gravitating toward the care of children, he did his pediatrics residency at Children's Hospital in Boston, followed by research work at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

He does not consider himself a geneticist. He considers himself a pediatrician. He stumbled onto the crossroads between the two worlds one night in 1988 when he was working in a hospital lab in Philadelphia and was asked to analyze a urine sample from a 6-year-old Amish boy named Danny Lapp. The child had the signs of cerebral palsy, but his parents insisted that he had been perfectly healthy for more than a year after he was born, whereas C.P. tends to make itself known much earlier. Morton ran a test and found glutaric acid in the boy's urine, the unmistakable sign of glutaric aciduria Type 1, known as GA1. It was a disease so rarely diagnosed as to be thought almost nonexistent. There were only seven or eight reported cases in the medical literature when Morton made his diagnosis, and not one of those was in Lancaster County.

Intrigued, Morton drove his old brown Honda to Amish country for the very first time. ''None of us had ever seen a case,'' he says. ''I came mostly out of curiosity.'' Danny's parents, John and Ida, told him how the boy had been crawling and babbling until he was 14 months old. Then he came down with a simple stomach virus and within a few hours became paralyzed and unable to speak. His uninsured farm family had amassed tens of thousands of dollars in bills trying to figure out what was wrong with him.

It was Morton's introduction to the Amish view of medicine. Although they keep their distance from most technology, they have developed a trust in doctors because they suffer from so much disease. It was also an introduction to their ways of paying for health care. The Old Order Amish do not accept government assistance, and therefore they do not get Medicaid. They also don't carry private insurance but rather rely on the community to cover bills that individuals cannot cover themselves. The system worked well for decades, back when medicine was simpler, but it was already struggling with the rising costs of treatment by the time Morton first arrived.

Morton tends to listen more than he talks, and only after the Lapps had told their story did he take his turn. GA1 works like that, he explained. It devastates swiftly and suddenly. GA1 patients lack an enzyme that fully breaks down protein. As a result, excess amounts of glutaric acid, a protein byproduct, accumulate in the brain and other organs. What happens next was unclear when Morton met the Lapps and remains fuzzy. But somehow the stress of what would normally be a mild childhood illness -- chickenpox, diarrhea, a simple cold -- can trigger a strokelike episode. Once the brain is ''injured,'' Morton said, the damage is irreversible.

Having read McKusick's work on Amish genetics, Morton theorized that if there was one patient with a rare genetic disorder in this contained population, there were likely to be others. (GA1, like nearly everything else Morton treats, is a recessive disorder -- to get it, a child must have a copy of the defective gene from each parent; if only one parent is a carrier, the couple will not produce a child with the disease, and if both parents are carriers, each of their children has a 25 percent chance of having the disease and a 50 percent chance of being a carrier.) When Morton asked Danny's parents if they knew of any other children like their son, they sent him to a neighboring family of seven children, two of whom had died, it appeared, of whatever had damaged Danny, and three of whom were still living but physically devastated. The gene for GA1 had not yet been found -- that would not happen for four more years -- but the biochemical urine tests Morton ran showed that these children, too, had glutaric aciduria. By the end of the summer, he had found 20 more cases among the Amish, some of whom had been told that their children had cerebral palsy, while others had never received a diagnosis.

And GA1 was not all he found. Every family knew someone with a child who was ''not right,'' and the list of rare disorders living behind the walls of the simple Lancaster County farms steadily grew. Many were metabolic disorders, which arise from the inability to fully break down proteins, fats or sugars, putting patients at risk for the sudden strokelike episodes. The isolation of these families, both physical and cultural, meant that their children could not quickly get the care they needed. The local pediatricians were not familiar with such obscure ailments. The nearest hospital was miles away, a trip the Amish make by horse and buggy or, if necessary, in a hired car or van. If help were closer and more attuned to their unique needs, Morton thought, these diseases might not be death sentences.

Against the advice of his mentors -- who believed he was throwing away a prestigious academic career -- he decided to open a clinic in Amish country. His goal, at first, had nothing to do with reading genes but was simply to treat disease. He kept his day job in the laboratory where he had diagnosed Danny Lapp's illness and also his night job in the newborn I.C.U. at a hospital near his suburban Philadelphia home. Once a week he would drive out to Lancaster County and make house calls on his growing list of Amish patients.

He did this for a year, while he applied for grant money, the traditional way of financing medical projects. He needed enough for some office space in Lancaster, a computer and a mass spectrometer, which cost about $80,000 at the time, to analyze urine and blood samples, as he had done with Danny Lapp. His wife, Caroline, would be his executive director. He would be the sole practitioner available to patients around the clock.

He did not get the grant, as his mentors warned, because as a junior clinician he was not good grant material. And most government and academic institutions prefer to finance pure research. He and Caroline were about to take a second mortgage on their house when The Wall Street Journal wrote about his struggle. Readers sent several hundred thousand dollars, Hewlett-Packard donated equipment and he was able to set up his clinic.

Today the Clinic for Special Children is probably the only place in the country with a mass spectrometer inside and a hitching post outside. The building itself was ''raised'' by a team of Amish and Mennonite carpenters, in the traditional post-and-beam style: it is held together by pegs, not nails. The two and a half acres of land on which it sits are in the middle of a field owned by the grandparents of some of the first children whose illnesses Morton diagnosed and who sold it to him at less than half the market price. As his office manager, Morton hired Rebecca Smoker, an Old Order Amish woman and aunt to the three children he met through the Lapps. Smoker greets patients wearing her traditional bonnet and apron and speaks to them in familiar Pennsylvania Dutch.

Ask Morton how his practice is different from every other medical office anywhere else in the country, and he will not start with the buggies and the bonnets and the clash of cultures. Nor will he begin with the fact that he no longer applies for research grants, because ''they take too much time to fill out, time I'd rather spend with patients,'' or that he raises most of his $1.2 million budget through the nominal fees he charges his patients and four annual auctions, organized entirely by the community, extravaganzas of handmade quilts, furniture and crafts.

What he will tell you is that he gets the rare chance to watch disease up close. Time was, he says, when all doctors treated genetic illness, though they didn't yet think of themselves as geneticists. ''We've been treating genetic disorders ever since the onset of the practice of medicine,'' he says. ''If your dad went deaf young and your granddad went deaf young, then odds were that you would go deaf young, and that was genetic, but we couldn't find the gene or see the gene or know about the gene, so it was simply called medicine.''

The modern era, he says, has brought knowledge, yes, but also a separation between those who study genetic roots of disease and those who treat that disease. ''We've trained a whole generation of people who, because they are in the lab, don't get very close to patients,'' he says. ''Funding has gone to lab-based research that doesn't require the individuals doing the research to know, meet or shake hands with the people who have the disease.''

In part that is because most geneticists study rare disorders, and the few patients who suffer from those disorders are scattered far from the research lab. So the researcher sees them only as bits of DNA collected on a field visit or sent by another doctor through the mail. On the flip side, the actual treating physician might see only one or two cases of a rare disorder in a career and will have to refer care to the experts in far-off research centers. Morton, in contrast, has a large percentage of existing GA1 cases in the country living right outside his clinic door, so he can research and treat at the same time. If an era of genomic medicine is to take root, he says, more doctors are going to have to learn how to combine the two. Separation of research and treatment might have worked during the intense discovery period of the last two decades, he says, but it will not work as genetic knowledge is more regularly integrated with patient care.

Which is not to say that he does not understand the value of traditional distance -- of keeping some analytical breathing space between doctor and patient. He has not, for instance, ''gone Amish.'' He lives in Strasburg, about a mile away from the clinic, in a house with electricity within and two cars outside. He and Caroline have three college-age children, who went to nearby public schools. True, they spent more time than the average child playing in barns with Amish friends. And there was the year they surprised their parents by bidding on and winning a pony and cart at one of the clinic fund-raising auctions. Soon after, the children could be seen riding the back roads between the clinic and their home in their own version of a horse and buggy.

But while Morton is not of the community he treats, he is immersed in it, and he says that the proximity has taught him volumes. ''We have struggled to take care of them over the years,'' he says, thinking of those he has lost, like Danny Lapp, who died a couple of years after the clinic opened. ''We've learned a lot.''

It is a process he compares to playing the cello. He took up the instrument five years ago, when he was 50. He was a lover of classical string music and often listened to J.S. Bach's Suites for Cello, which in their entirety take more than two hours to play. The Suite V in C minor Sarabande contains 107 notes, and he set out to master those. He has played them every day for the past five years and still finds them difficult, still finds the unexpected. That, he says, is the way to study disease as well. ''Over 15 years, I have spent more than 10,000 hours learning about GA,'' he says. ''Many days, I have worked 18 hours or more trying to keep a child alive and limit the injury the disease causes the brain. I study the cello just as I study medicine. I am not looking for skills and information. I want insight, understanding.''

Through immersion he has come to understand that the devastation of metabolic disorders like GA1 is not inevitable, as had once been thought. If you can keep the child healthy for the first 24 months of life, the time of the greatest brain development, Morton has learned, you can probably keep him healthy for life. Strict monitoring from birth of the ingestion of protein can keep glutaric acid from accumulating and becoming toxic. But even if the child does go ''into crisis,'' does get a cold or flu, etc., Morton has also learned to take immediate action to limit the transformation from healthy to helpless. ''We've developed strategies for rescuing children when they get sick,'' he says, including immediate infusions of sugar to keep patients from losing oxygen, and an amino-acid derivative, carnitine, that helps the brain reverse the buildup of excess glutaric acid. The clinic has taken to giving parties for 2-year-old GA1 patients because ''it truly is a new birth day,'' Morton says. He does not get every patient past the danger zone, but he certainly saves more lives than before. When he first arrived in Lancaster, 95 percent of the GA1 children he treated were physically and cognitively devastated. Now only 25 percent are.

While he was fine-tuning clinical treatment, Morton was also filling in genetic informational gaps. During the 1990's, scientists throughout the world identified a variety of different mutations, or genetic glitches, that can cause GA1. In 1996, by comparing the DNA of his affected patients with the range of possible mutations found to cause the disease, Morton determined which mutation all his patients shared. Now known as ''the Amish mutation,'' it is also found in patients in areas of Europe where the ancestors of his patients once lived. Morton has come to know the genes that cause other Plain People diseases too. Some he discovered himself -- like the gene for one cause of sudden infant death syndrome common in the Amish. Others he did not discover but narrowed down -- like the gene for maple syrup urine disease, which got its name because sugars thrown off by the body give patients' urine a distinctly sweet smell. M.S.U.D. is effectively the Mennonite version of GA1 -- similar symptoms, similar inability to digest certain proteins, but found among Mennonites rather than the Amish. It can be caused by a variety of genes and mutations, and in 1994 Morton determined which of these specifically afflicted his Mennonite patients.

Such knowledge fortified his treatment arsenal. All of Morton's Mennonite M.S.U.D. patients have the same mutation for the disease, and theirs is the most lethal version possible; their bodies do not produce any of the enzyme required to break down proteins properly. But not all his M.S.U.D. patients are Mennonite. About 15 percent of his practice consists of non-Plain families who have traveled to Lancaster from 27 states and more than a dozen countries, learning of his work through the word-of-mouth and Web-based communities that grow up around any disease. These patients often have less-lethal versions of the mutation, a fact that is verifiable only once you can read their genes. Morton recently began treating a 14-year-old girl whose family is not Mennonite but was originally from Puerto Rico and who has a milder form of M.S.U.D. in that her body produces some of the critical enzyme. The girl can eat three times as much protein as the Mennonite children, which makes a world of difference to her every day.

For a brief moment, Morton thought he could cure at least some of his patients. The year was 1999, and the disease was Crigler-Najjar syndrome, a liver-enzyme deficiency that allows a lethal buildup of bilirubin in the blood. It was first discovered in 1952 by Dr. Victor Najjar and Dr. John Crigler, who was a professor of Morton's at Harvard Medical School. Crigler-Najjar children become severely jaundiced and must sleep under hot, bright, blue-toned lights to break down the bilirubin. Eventually, though, even the lights don't work, and the condition causes brain damage or death. There are about 90 known cases in the country, and 25 of those are Amish or Mennonite. Nearly all of those are Morton's patients.

The field of gene therapy had existed for only a decade when, in June 1999, Morton invited many of those patients to a conference at a local inn. There the families learned of a new delivery system for genetic repair. Until that point, scientists had been experimenting with a method using viruses to transport DNA into the body, hoping that the viruses would insert themselves into cell structure and that the replacement DNA would correct the gene mutation. The new theory introduced at the 1999 meeting was called chimeraplasty, and rather than relying on viruses, it used a molecule called a chimeraplast -- a manufactured mix of DNA and RNA -- to trigger the system's cells to repair themselves.

The most notable moment came when Morton announced that the first human trials of the new approach would be on three of his Crigler-Najjar patients. The company that had developed the chimera technology would ask the F.D.A. for permission to test it on humans in the fall. ''I really thought we would start treatment in six months,'' he says now. ''I believed it would happen.''

What happened instead was that two months after the conference, in September 1999, an 18-year-old Arizonan named Jesse Gelsinger died during a gene-therapy trial at the University of Pennsylvania. Gelsinger was not a Crigler-Najjar patient, and the trial in question used viruses, not chimeraplasts, but the field came to a complete halt for several years and has still not recovered. The company that was to conduct the Crigler-Najjar trials was sold to a French firm, and the scientists who had brought hope to Morton's patients moved on to other things.

The disappointment changed the lens on Morton's view of medicine. It made him look not at what science might someday be but rather at what was already possible. It solidified his conviction that genetics is not a separate realm but a part of everyday care. He had been waiting for the start of genomic medicine. When his gene-therapy trials fell through, he realized that genomic medicine was what he was already practicing. +

Crigler-Najjar patients, he knew, would benefit from liver transplants, but transplants are invasive and expensive, and he had been delaying the procedure for a number of children, hoping to stall until gene therapy was available. He stopped stalling, and four of his patients have had those transplants since then. Similarly, he concluded that the best available hope for GA1 patients was diagnosing their disease at birth, before they are nursed or given protein-rich formula. So he turned new attention to the subject of newborn testing.

To that end, he hired Erik Puffenberger, who has a Ph.D. in human genetics. Puffenberger now oversees the hundreds of thousands of dollars of instrumentation at the clinic -- a single room that is as well equipped as most university labs. There is the mass spectrometer that Morton started with 17 years ago. (Although the original has been replaced with a newer model.) There is also a gene sequencer, an amino-acid analyzer and a gas chromatograph, which allows scientists to separate and identify organic acids in a sample of blood or urine.

Morton began screening newborns before he even opened the clinic, starting by collecting urine-soaked diapers from local midwives and testing them for GA1 and M.S.U.D. Now, under Puffenberger, the clinic does onsite tests for about 40 disorders, and while some of those tests can be done during pregnancy, they rarely are, because for the Amish and Mennonites terminating a pregnancy is not an option. Testing immediately before birth, however, raises no such ethical issues, and patients have come to expect that when labor begins and water breaks, a midwife will send a sample of amniotic fluid to the clinic via courier, and the analysis will be done within hours, sometimes even before the baby is born. Some are biochemical tests -- looking for chemicals in blood or urine that are the warning signs of a disease. Some are genetic tests -- actually looking into a patient's DNA to either confirm a preliminary biological test or find evidence of a disorder that cannot be confirmed by other means. But whichever the mechanism, the disorders found are all caused by defective genes.

The clinic tests vigorously because all the rest of the doctors' knowledge -- how to manage patients, and adjust their protein intake, and recognize their early danger signs -- is worthless if they don't know which patients to treat. ''It makes no sense to identify a child with a genetic disease only after that child has been injured,'' Puffenberger says. ''The only way you can even think of treating that child is to identify them before they get sick and then figuring out how to keep them healthy.''

For more than a decade, Morton has been part of a rising chorus of voices around the country arguing that every state should test for a wide array of genetic disorders from birth -- including GA1. That, Morton says, is the best current use of genetic knowledge. It is an idea that is slowly gaining traction. Just this year, the March of Dimes recommended that babies should be screened for 29 disorders, including GA1. But at the moment, the country is still a procedural patchwork. The tests a newborn receives depend on where a mother gives birth. According to the National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center, Mississippi tests for 51 disorders, while miles away in Louisiana newborns are tested for only 9. Massachusetts tests for 16, Texas for 8. New York began testing for 50 over the past year, but before that tested for only 11.

Each added test has the potential to save lives, Morton preaches. Donna Upchurch, who has never met Morton, is not of Amish descent but is a believer. When her daughter Alli was born three years ago in a very modern suburb of Atlanta, Donna and her husband decided to bank her cord blood as a potential treatment for her mother-in-law, who had leukemia. In the package that came with the collection vial was an expanded newborn screening kit, one that looked for 25 disorders that Georgia does not routinely screen for. Donna took that kit to her daughter's one-week checkup. The test came back positive for GA1, the first known case in the state.

And yet GA1 is still not included in Georgia's mandated screening panel, and the standard argument against adding any difficult and rare disease goes something like this: ''They say, 'We're not sure we want to screen for it because we don't know how to treat it,''' Caroline Morton says. ''Well, it's not like the disease goes away if you don't screen it. At best you learn more with each diagnosis until you can treat it, and at worst you give the families some early idea of what their future might hold.''

A related mission of the clinic, therefore, is improving methods of treatment for rare syndromes as a way of breaking the cycle of objections to screening. If a disorder can be treated, then testing for it becomes less controversial. To this end, Morton invited Kevin Strauss, a young Harvard-trained pediatrician, to join the clinic, the first time a second doctor has taken full responsibility for patients. In part, Morton brought Strauss aboard because he wanted someone in the clinic whose training is more up-to-date than his own. And in part he is there to give Morton time to share the clinic's knowledge with the rest of the medical world. Until Strauss arrived, Morton had written very little of what he knew about GA1 treatment for publication in scientific journals. And that has caused some in medical circles to think of him as a maverick and an outsider, because serious scientists validate what they know through publication and peer review.

Morton agrees that he does not publish enough, and that talking to doctors who track him down when they are confronted with a case of GA1 is not the best way to disseminate medical information. ''In 15 minutes over the telephone, we can't tell them what it took 15 years to learn,'' he says. In the four years since Strauss joined the practice, Morton has published two articles in the respected American Journal of Medical Genetics, summarizing the accumulated knowledge of years of GA1 and maple syrup urine disease treatments. ''We want to publish, we intend to publish,'' he says, ''but we also have patients to treat.''

Every year, Morton travels back to West Virginia to talk at the National Youth Science Camp, which invites outstanding students to come explore nature and science for several weeks. He does this in part to remind himself of where he expected life would take him and where he is now. He begins by playing the Suite V Sarabande, and then he tells the high schoolers, among other things, that ''the course of my life, my current work as a doctor, the questions that I have asked and answered were unimaginable when'' he was their age. ''Technology and information, upon which I depend every day, has changed in remarkable and unpredictable ways over the past 40 years. The very language of questions and answers that are fundamental to my current professional life didn't exist'' when he was in high school.

What is true of Morton's life is true of medicine in general. It is not what scientists expected it to be, and the road it has taken was not even constructed when most of today's physicians and geneticists began their training. It is also true of individual research journeys. Morton has begun with many a routine assumption and wound up with an unusual, unforeseen conclusion.

Such was the case with Shawn Weaver, a Mennonite boy Morton examined at a few weeks of age in 1998. Shawn's mother, Dorothy, described a difficult pregnancy, with far too much amniotic fluid and a premature birth. From the beginning, Shawn had difficulty breathing and nursing and growing. Years ago a baby this sick would probably not have survived, which may be why the Weavers had no known history of any genetic disorders in their families.

Dorothy and her husband, Mark, had taken their eldest son to the clinic because the boy would not stop screaming. Morton saw the problem for himself when Shawn cried for three hours. ''We put him in the hospital for a few days just to give his family a break and so I could have a chance to figure out what was wrong with him,'' Morton says. He first suspected reflux, but treatment didn't keep the boy from crying.

When Shawn was 5 months old, he had his first seizure. Dorothy was nursing him when he became rigid and his eyes rolled up in his head. A few hours later he had another one. Morton prescribed anticonvulsant medication, which seemed to reduce the severity but not the number of seizures; soon the boy was suffering through as many as 20 episodes a day. Despite every test Morton and Puffenberger could think of, they had no idea what disease Shawn had.

''The only thing I knew is that I didn't know what it was,'' Morton says. ''That's an important kind of knowledge. You keep looking.'' As all the tests continued to come back negative, Dorothy remembers thinking, ''Well, at least it's not something genetic, because we wanted to have more children.'' When Shawn turned 5, the tests stopped. ''We gave up on having a diagnosis,'' Dorothy says. ''We assumed we would never know.''

Shawn's little sister was born, healthy, in 2001 and his baby brother, healthy too, arrived in 2004. Shawn, in the meantime, repeatedly missed developmental milestones. Though he could understand what was said to him, he could not form words. Nor could he walk or control his hands. What he could do was rest the soles of his feet up against his ears.

Shawn was hospitalized at Lancaster General 15 times during the first five years of his life. It was during one of those visits, in spring 2004, that Morton asked Dorothy the same question he asked the Lapps 16 years before: Do you know any other children like your son? By that time the genome had been mapped, and there were new genetic techniques that made it simpler to find gene mutations working with a small sample size of affected patients, he told her. Whereas just a few years earlier it took hundreds of samples to screen for one mutant gene, new methods, more precise and quicker, made it possible to use as few as two or three. If they found a few more children, Morton said, the clinic could try to find the underlying genetic cause.

As it happened, Dorothy did know, indirectly, of two other Mennonite children. The first was a boy born five months before Shawn who lived in Illinois. Shawn's great-aunt knew this boy's family through her church conference and said she thought that the two children resembled each other, so Dorothy wrote to the family a few years earlier, describing Shawn, and struck up a long-distance friendship. The second child used to come with his mother into the grocery store that Dorothy's parents own nearby. Dorothy's mother often talked about the boy who looked just like Shawn. Both of the other boys had died by the time Morton asked his pivotal question. But their families, who each had another affected child, agreed to participate in research. Deciding, as Morton had years earlier, that where there were two there must be more, Dorothy set out to find them, searching the interwoven Mennonite pockets spread across the country.

The culture of Plain People is a patchwork of practice and belief. Among the Mennonites there are those, like the Weavers, who are strict constructionists, though even they bend the rules to adapt to the times. A phone in the house is prohibited, for instance, but they can keep one out in a shack in the field for urgent matters and farm business. Some of the families Dorothy called from her shack phone spoke to her from their own shacks, others from within their homes, a few on their cellphones. Some ban radio and television from their lives, a few have computers, but just for business use, others searched the Web regularly. But despite these differences, the stories they told were almost identical, hinting at their shared roots. All their children had been born early, all their pregnancies involved extra amniotic fluid, all had seizures and hyperelastic limbs. And none of their doctors could figure out what was wrong.

In summer 2004, four of these families met at the clinic so Erik Puffenberger could take blood from the parents and children; three other families sent samples by air courier. Analyzing the DNA would require a cutting-edge Affymetrix GeneChip scanner, which Puffenberger did not have. Instead, he sent the collected blood off to the Translational Genomics Research Institute, a biotech company based in Phoenix. It owned the $250,000 machine and offered to run the samples free of charge, for the sake of research. (A few months later, Affymetrix donated a new scanner to the clinic and trained Puffenberger to use it.)

The data the machine generated was a computerized array of letters and numbers that represent clusters of genes. He ran programs that analyzed the data, as he had done in the past with samples of as few as two or three. But this time nothing jumped out of the computer. Then Puffenberger began scrolling through the 84,000 genetic markers (12,000 from each patient), trying to find the mutation -- the piece of DNA that had been scrambled -- that all seven children had in common.

Puffenberger spent hours, days, weeks staring at the screen, waking up in the middle of the night, pacing the clinic hallways. At one point, he began to doubt the accuracy of his samples, thinking that maybe all seven children didn't have the same syndrome after all. ''Are you sure all these kids have pretzel syndrome?'' he asked Morton, using the nickname the staff had given the disease. Assured that they all had the same symptoms and appeared to have the same disorder, Puffenberger came back at the data from another direction. It was then that he noticed not the presence of something but the absence. All seven children showed a ''no call'' for the same marker on Chromosome 17. A piece of DNA was missing from each, resulting in a partial deletion of a gene. After that it was a simple step to develop an in-house test to identify the mutation in patients who might have it and parents who might carry it. A few weeks later they used that test for the first time to diagnose pretzel syndrome in a new patient.

Morton, Puffenberger and Strauss are now creating a portrait of the disease -- information they say they eventually hope to publish in a medical journal, along with the exact location of the gene, so that other scientists can critique their work. For the moment, their rough sketch of the disorder shows patients with fewer nerve cells in their brains, which probably leads to their seizures and might explain why known seizure medications don't really help them. They have an increased likelihood of heart problems, in the form of a ''hole in the heart,'' and also of kidney problems, resulting in constant thirst and urination, known as diabetes insipidus. (It is this constant thirst that Morton hypothesizes might have caused Shawn to cry nonstop as a baby.) Their skeletons are abnormally shaped, their mental development is significantly slowed, the connective tissue of their joints is malformed and at least one of the children developed leukemia. They will probably die young. As far as Morton and his colleagues know, there is no available cure.

It was early spring of this year when Morton told Dorothy and Mark Weaver that he thought his team had found the pretzel syndrome gene. A week later their son died. ''It didn't come in time to help Shawn, but it did help us,'' Dorothy says. She and the other mothers had started a ''circle letter,'' in which the first in the chain writes a page and mails it to the second, who adds her own page and sends it farther down the line. That's what she uses to spread medical news from Morton.

When genomic medicine is at its best, it works as it does for GA1. A look into a patient's genes gives doctors something specific and practical to use to protect the patient. Diseases like GA1 are the easiest to do this with because they are not only single-gene disorders -- disorders that are caused by a mutation of just one gene -- but they are also metabolic, meaning that the cascade of damage can be prevented with early intervention. That they are simple in their genetics and straightforward in their mechanics makes these disorders easier to find and to mitigate.

More difficult are complex traits, caused by the interaction of several genes at once -- things like high blood pressure or arthritis or osteoporosis. These are harder to find and more complicated to mitigate, though the chances brightened recently with the announcement that a follow-up of the Human Genome Project is now complete. It is effectively a ''map'' that identifies ''neighborhoods,'' in which genes likely to cause related diseases tend to cluster, perhaps making it easier to find the source of common conditions. Odds are that even after doctors learn to read the genetic roots of these disorders, and tell us that we are at risk, it will be a long while before they can tell us exactly how to fix things.

Pretzel syndrome is a single-gene disorder, but it is complex in its mechanics, and in that way it is the more telling example of the implications of genomic medicine for most of us. All Morton can offer the pretzel syndrome patients at the moment is information. Which leads to the question, What is the value of knowing if that knowledge does not come with a cure? It's a question the families in the study wrestled with last July when the Weavers invited them all to their farm for barbecued chicken and an update from Morton.

Mary Lou Martin, whose teenage daughter, Jennifer, is afflicted with the disorder, spent a long time that day talking with Kendra Zimmerman, who was there with 7-year-old Alana. Mary Lou had been hearing about Alana for years, as mutual friends would regularly tell her about the little girl whose behavior and movements were just like her own daughter's. Long before Dorothy Weaver called to invite her into the study, Mary Lou suspected that Jennifer and Alana had the same disease, but she was unsure about approaching the younger mother to tell her. To do so, she knew, would be to rob Kendra of denial and possibility. ''Alana was still young,'' she says. ''I don't know how I would have felt back when Jennifer was little if somebody who had a child eight years older had come and said their child, who had so many problems, seemed just like mine. When they are still a baby, you are still thinking it might get better.''

But at the picnic, Kendra told Mary Lou that she had been wanting to talk over the years, too. Sitting together, Mary Lou says, the harsh truths she had been trying to spare a stranger walloped both of them full force. Seeing other children with the same disorder meant facing the reality that the damage was lasting. ''You see all these children in one place and you realize, This is the way it's going to be,'' she says. ''They will always be in diapers, in wheelchairs. We got some knowledge, but at the same time we gave up some hope.''

Alana died last month. And still, both women say that they would rather have answers than uncertainty. That is Morton's conclusion too. His entire career was changed the day he told Danny Lapp's family that he knew what was wrong with their son. Then he set about learning how to cure it. He says he hopes, one day, to be able to soften the blows that pretzel syndrome deals his patients too. But even if that isn't possible, he says, ''at least they have a name for what's wrong. We can tell them it's not their fault, it's nothing they did wrong. It's in their genes. That gives us a place to start.''

	The Biotech Death of Jesse Gelsinger


The jagged peak of Mount Wrightson towers 9,450 feet above Tucson, overlooking a deep gorge where the prickly pear cactus that dots the desert floor gives way to a lush forest of ponderosa pine. It is said that this is as close to heaven as you can get in southern Arizona. Jesse Gelsinger loved this place. So it was here, on a clear Sunday afternoon in early November, that Paul Gelsinger laid his 18-year-old son to rest, seven weeks after a gene-therapy experiment cost him his life.

The ceremony was simple and impromptu. Two dozen mourners -- Jesse's father; his mother, Pattie; his stepmother, Mickie; and two sisters, a brother, three doctors and a smattering of friends -- trudged five miles along a steep trail to reach the rocky outcropping at the top. There, Paul Gelsinger shared stories of his son, who loved motorcycles and professional wrestling and was, to his father's irritation, distinctly lacking in ambition. Jesse was the kind of kid who kept $10.10 in his bank account -- You need $10 to keep it open,'' Gelsinger explained -- but those assembled on the mountaintop agreed that he had a sharp wit and a sensitive heart.

At Gelsinger's request, the hikers had carried Jesse's medicine bottles filled with his ashes, and now they were gathered at the edge of the peak. Steve Raper, the surgeon who gave Jesse what turned out to be a lethal injection of new genes, pulled a small blue book of poetry from his pocket. ''Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth,'' Raper read, reciting a passage from an elegy by Thomas Gray, ''a youth to Fortune and Fame unknown./Fair Science frowned not on his humble birth.'' Then the surgeon, the grieving father and the rest scattered Jesse's ashes into the canyon, where they rose on a gust of wind and fell again in a powerful cloud of fine gray dust. ''I will look to you here often, Jess,'' Paul Gelsinger said sadly.

Jesse Gelsinger was not sick before died. He suffered from ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, a rare metabolic disorder, but it was controlled with a low-protein diet and drugs, 32 pills a day. He knew when he signed up for the experiment at the University of Pennsylvania that he would not benefit; the study was to test the safety of a treatment for babies with a fatal form of his disorder. Still, it offered hope, the promise that someday Jesse might be rid of the cumbersome medications and diet so restrictive that half a hot dog was a treat. ''What's the worst that can happen to me?'' he told a friend shortly before he left for the Penn hospital, in Philadelphia. ''I die, and it's for the babies.''

As far as government officials know, Jesse's death on Sept. 17 was the first directly related to gene therapy. The official cause, as listed on the death certificate filed by Raper, was adult respiratory distress syndrome: his lungs shut down. The truth is more complicated. Jesse's therapy consisted of an infusion of corrective genes, encased in a dose of weakened cold virus, adenovirus, which functioned as what scientists call a vector. Vectors are like taxicabs that drive healthy DNA into cells; viruses, whose sole purpose is to get inside cells and infect them, make useful vectors. The Penn researchers had tested their vector, at the same dose Jesse got, in mice, monkeys, baboons and one human patient, and had seen expected, flulike side effects, along with some mild liver inflammation, which disappeared on its own. When Jesse got the vector, he suffered a chain reaction that the testing had not predicted -- jaundice, a blood-clotting disorder, kidney failure, lung failure and brain death: in Raper's words, ''multiple-organ-system failure.'' The doctors are still investigating; their current hypothesis is that the adenovirus triggered an overwhelming inflammatory reaction -- in essence, an immune-system revolt. What they do not understand yet is why.

Every realm of medicine has its defining moment, often with a human face attached. Polio had Jonas Salk. In vitro fertilization had Louise Brown, the world's first test-tube baby. Transplant surgery had Barney Clark, the Seattle dentist with the artificial heart. AIDS had Magic Johnson. Now gene therapy has Jesse Gelsinger.

Until Jesse died, gene therapy was a promising idea that had so far failed to deliver. As scientists map the human genome, they are literally tripping over mutations that cause rare genetic disorders, including OTC deficiency, Jesse's disease. The initial goal was simple: to cure, or prevent, these illnesses by replacing defective genes with healthy ones. Biotech companies have poured millions into research -- not for rare hereditary disorders but for big-profit illnesses like cancer, heart disease and AIDS. As of August, the government had reviewed 331 gene-therapy protocols involving more than 4,000 patients. Just 41 were for the ''monogeneic,'' or single-gene, defect diseases whose patients so desperately hoped gene therapy would be their salvation.

At the same time, the science has progressed slowly; researchers have had trouble devising vectors that can carry genes to the right cells and get them to work once they are there. Four years ago, Dr. Harold Varmus, the director of the National Institutes of Health, commissioned a highly critical report about gene therapy, chiding investigators for creating ''the mistaken and widespread perception of success.'' Since then, there have been some accomplishments: a team at Tufts University has used gene therapy to grow new blood vessels for heart disease patients, for instance. But so far, gene therapy has not cured anyone. As Ruth Macklin, a bioethicist and member of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, the National Institutes of Health panel that oversees gene-therapy research, says, bluntly, ''Gene therapy is not yet therapy.''

On Dec. 8, the ''RAC,'' as the committee is called, will begin a public inquiry into Jesse's death, as well as the safety of adenovirus, which has been used in roughly one-quarter of all gene-therapy clinical trials. The Penn scientists will report on their preliminary results, and investigators, who at the RAC's request have submitted thousands of pages of patient safety data to the committee, will discuss the side effects of adenovirus. Among them will be researchers from the Schering-Plough Corporation, which was running two experiments in advanced liver cancer patients that used methods similar to Penn's. Enrollment in those trials was suspended by the Food and Drug Administration after Jesse's death. The company, under pressure from the RAC, has since released information showing that some patients experienced serious side effects, including changes in liver function and blood-cell counts, mental confusion and nausea; two experienced minor strokes, although one had a history of them. Once all the data on adenovirus are analyzed at the Dec. 8 meeting, the RAC may recommend restrictions on its use, which will almost certainly slow down some aspects of gene-therapy research.

The meeting will be important for another reason: it will mark an unprecedented public airing of information about the safety of gene therapy -- precisely the kind of sharing the RAC has unsuccessfully sought in the past. Officials say gene therapy has claimed no lives besides Jesse's. But since his death, there have been news reports that other patients died during the course of experiments -- from their diseases, as opposed to the therapy -- and that the scientists involved did not report those deaths to the RAC, as is required. This has created a growing cloud of suspicion over gene therapy, raising questions about whether other scientists may have withheld information that could have prevented Jesse's death. That question cannot be answered until all the data are analyzed. But one thing is certain: four years after the field was rocked by Varmus's highly critical evaluation, it is now being rocked again, this time over an issue more fundamental than efficacy -- safety.

''I think it's a perilous time for gene therapy,'' says LeRoy Walters, a bioethicist at Georgetown University and former chairman of the RAC. ''Until now, we have been able to say, 'Well, it hasn't helped many people, but at least it hasn't hurt people.' That has changed.''

No one, perhaps, is more acutely aware of gene therapy's broken promise than Mark Batshaw, the pediatrician who proposed the experiment that cost Jesse Gelsinger his life.

At 54, Batshaw, who left the University of Pennsylvania last year for Children's National Medical Center, in Washington, is tall and gangly with slightly stooped shoulders and a shy smile that gives him the air of an awkward schoolboy, which he once was. As a child, Batshaw struggled with hyperactivity: he didn't read until the third grade; in the fourth, his teacher grew so irritated at his constant chatter that she stuck his chair out in the hall. The experience has left him with a soft spot for developmentally disabled children, which is how he has become one of the world's foremost experts in urea-cycle disorders, among them OTC deficiency.

The urea cycle is a series of five liver enzymes that help rid the body of ammonia, a toxic breakdown product of protein. When these enzymes are missing or deficient, ammonia -- the same ammonia that you scrub your floors with,'' Batshaw explains -- accumulates in the blood and travels to the brain, causing coma, brain damage and death. OTC deficiency is the most common urea-cycle disorder, occurring in one out of every 40,000 births. Its genetic mutation occurs on the X chromosome, so women are typically carriers, while their sons suffer the disease.

Severe OTC deficiency is, Batshaw says, ''a devastating disease.'' Typically, newborns slip into a coma within 72 hours of birth. Most suffer severe brain damage. Half die in the first month, and half of the survivors die by age 5. Batshaw was a young postdoctoral fellow when he met his first urea-cycle-disorder patient in 1973, correctly diagnosing the disease at a time when most other doctors had never heard of it. Within two years, he and his colleagues had devised the first treatment, a low-protein formula called keto-acid. Later, they came up with what remains standard therapy to this day: sodium benzoate, a preservative, and another type of sodium, which bind to ammonia and help eliminate it from the body.

But the therapy cannot prevent the coma that is often the first sign of OTC and ravages the affected infant. By the time Batshaw joined the faculty at Penn in 1988, he was dreaming of a cure -- gene therapy. Patients were dreaming, too, says Tish Simon, former co-president of the National Urea Cycle Disorders Foundation, whose son died of OTC deficiency three years ago. ''All of us saw gene therapy as the hope for the future,'' Simon says. ''And certainly, if anybody was going to do it, it had to be Mark Batshaw.''

Gene therapy became a reality on Sept. 14, 1990, in a hospital room at the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Md., when a 4-year-old girl with a severe immune-system deficiency received a 30-minute infusion of white blood cells that had been engineered to contain copies of the gene she lacked. Rarely in modern medicine has an experiment been filled with so much hope; news of the treatment ricocheted off front pages around the world. The scientist who conducted it, Dr. W. French Anderson, quickly became known as the father of gene therapy. ''We had got ourselves all hyped up,'' Anderson now admits, ''thinking there would be rapid, quick, easy, early cures.''

Among those keeping a close eye on Anderson's debut was Jim Wilson, a square-jawed, sandy-haired Midwesterner who decided to follow his father's footsteps in medicine when he realized he wasn't going to make it in football. As a graduate student in biological chemistry, Wilson had taken a keen interest in rare genetic diseases. ''All I did,'' he says, ''was dream about gene therapy.''

Today, as director of the Institute for Human Gene Therapy at the University of Pennsylvania, Wilson is in an excellent position to make that dream a reality. Headquartered in a century-old building amid the leafy maple trees and brick sidewalks of the picturesque Penn campus, the six-year-old institute, with 250 employees, state-of-the-art laboratories and a $25 million annual budget, is the largest academic gene-therapy program in the nation. In a field rife with big egos, Wilson is regarded as first-rate. ''Present company excluded,'' Anderson says, ''he's the best person in the field.''

Batshaw was banging on Wilson's door even before Wilson arrived at Penn in March 1993, and within a month they were collaborating on studies of OTC-deficient mice. Their first task was to develop a vector. Adenovirus seemed a logical choice.

There had been some early problems with safety -- a 1993 cystic fibrosis experiment was shut down when a patient was hospitalized with inflamed lungs -- but Wilson and Batshaw say they figured out how to make a safer vector by deleting extra viral genes. Adenovirus was the right size: when its viral genes were excised, the OTC gene fit right in. It had a ''ZIP code,'' on it, Batshaw says, that would carry it straight to the liver. And while its effects did not last, it worked quickly, which meant that it might be able to reverse a coma, sparing babies from brain damage. ''It wasn't going to be a cure soon,'' Batshaw says, ''but it might be a treatment soon.''

The mouse experiments were encouraging. Mice that had the therapy survived for two to three months even while fed a high-protein diet. Those that lacked the treatment died. ''It wasn't subtle,'' Wilson says. ''We felt pretty compelled by that.'' But when the team contemplated testing in people, they ran smack into an ethical quandary: who should be their subjects?

To Wilson, the answer seemed obvious: sick babies. Arthur Caplan, the university's resident bioethics expert, thought otherwise. Caplan says parents of dying infants are incapable of giving informed consent: ''They are coerced by the disease of their child.'' He advised Wilson to test only stable adults, either female carriers or men like Jesse, with partial enzyme deficiencies. The National Urea Cycle Disorders Foundation agreed. When Batshaw turned up at their 1994 annual meeting asking for volunteers, so many mothers offered to be screened for the OTC gene that it took him four hours to draw all the blood.

By the time Mark Batshaw and Jim Wilson submitted their experiment to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for approval, the panel was in danger of being disbanded. Varmus, the N.I.H. director, who won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of a family of cancer-causing genes, had made no secret of his distaste for the conduct of gene-therapy researchers. He thought the science was too shoddy to push forward with human testing, and it bothered him that so few experiments were focusing on genetic diseases. It irked him to have to sign off on protocols the RAC approved, and it irked him even more to see biotech companies touting those approvals, like some kind of N.I.H. imprimatur, in the business pages of the papers. ''Some days,'' says Dr. Nelson Wivel, the committee's former executive director, who now works for Wilson at Penn, ''it felt as though the RAC was helping the biotech industry raise money. Dr. Varmus hated that.''

At the same time, the pharmaceutical industry and AIDS activists were complaining that the RAC was redundant: the F.D.A. already reviewed gene-therapy proposals. So in mid-1995, after seeking the advice of an expert panel, Varmus reorganized the RAC, slashing its membership from 25 to 15 and stripping it of its approval authority -- a decision that, some say, has enabled gene-therapy researchers to ignore the panel and keep information about safety to themselves. ''The RAC,'' complains Dr. Robert Erickson, a University of Arizona medical geneticist who served on the panel, ''became a debating society.''

The Batshaw-Wilson protocol was among the last the committee would ever approve. The plan was for 18 adults (19 eventually signed up, including Tish Simon, but the last patient was never treated, because of Jesse's death) to receive an infusion of the OTC gene, tucked inside an adenovirus vector, through a catheter in the hepatic artery, which leads to the liver. The goal was to find what Wilson calls ''the maximum tolerated dose,'' one high enough to get the gene to work, but low enough to spare patients serious side effects. Subjects would be split into six groups of three, with each group receiving a slightly higher dose than the last. This is standard fare in safety testing. ''You go up in small-enough increments,'' Wilson explains, ''that you can pull the plug on the thing before people get hurt.''

The experiment stood in stark contrast to others that had earned Varmus's scorn. It was paid for by N.I.H., which meant it had withstood the rigors of scientific peer review. It was aimed at a rare genetic disease, not cancer or AIDS. It was supported by plenty of animal research: Wilson and his team had performed more than 20 mouse experiments to test efficacy and a dozen safety studies on mice, rhesus monkeys and baboons. Still, it made Erickson, one of two scientists assigned by the RAC to review the experiment, uneasy.

He was troubled by data showing that three monkeys had died of a blood-clotting disorder and severe liver inflammation when they received an earlier, stronger version of the adenovirus vector at a dose 20 times the highest dose planned for the study. No one had injected adenovirus directly into the bloodstream before, either via the liver or otherwise, and the scientists admitted that it was difficult to tell precisely how people would respond. They planned to confine the infusion to the right lobe of the liver, so that if damage occurred it would be contained there, sparing the left lobe. And they outlined the major risks: bleeding, from either the gene-therapy site or a subsequent liver biopsy, which would require surgery; or serious liver inflammation, which could require an organ transplant and might lead to death.

Both Erickson and the other scientific reviewer thought the experiment was too risky to test on asymptomatic volunteers and recommended rejection. But in the end, Batshaw and Wilson prevailed. They offered up Caplan's argument that testing on babies was inappropriate. And they agreed to inject the vector into the bloodstream, as opposed to putting it directly into the liver. That decision, however, was later reversed by the F.D.A., which insisted that because the adenovirus would travel through the blood and wind up in the liver anyway, the original plan was safer.

The RAC, in such disarray from Varmus's reorganization that it did not meet again for another year, was never informed of the change.

Jesse Gelsinger was 17 when his pediatric geneticist, Dr. Randy Heidenreich, first told him about the Penn proposal. He wanted to sign up right away. But he had to wait until he was 18.

Paul Gelsinger was also enthusiastic. A trim 47-year-old with intense blue eyes, Gelsinger, who makes his living as a handyman, gained custody of his four children nine years ago, when he divorced their mother, who suffers from manic depression. He had been having some difficulty with Jesse then; the boy was in the midst of an adolescent rebellion and was refusing to take his medicine. ''I said: 'Wow, Jess, they're working on your disorder. Maybe they'll come up with a cure.'''

Jesse's was not a typical case of OTC deficiency: his mutation appears to have occurred spontaneously in the womb. His disease having been diagnosed when he was 2, Jesse was what scientists call a mosaic -- a small portion of his cells produced the missing enzyme. When he watched what he ate and took his medicine, he was fine. But one day last December, Paul Gelsinger arrived home to find his son curled up on the couch. He had been vomiting uncontrollably, a sign, Paul knew, that Jesse's ammonia was rising. Jesse landed in the hospital, comatose and on life support. When he recovered, he never missed another pill.

On June 18, the day Jesse turned 18, the Gelsingers -- Paul, Mickie and the children -- flew to Philadelphia to see Paul's family. They played tourists, visiting the Liberty Bell and the Rocky statue, where Jesse was photographed, fists raised, a picture that would circulate in the newspapers after his death. On the 22nd, they went to the University of Pennsylvania, where they met Raper, the surgeon, who explained the experiment and did blood and liver-function tests to see if Jesse was eligible. He was, and his treatment was scheduled for the fall. Jesse would be the youngest patient enrolled.

On Sept. 9, Jesse returned to Philadelphia, this time alone. He took one duffel bag full of clothes and another full of wrestling videos. Paul Gelsinger planned to fly in a week later for the liver biopsy, which he considered the trial's most serious risk.

The treatment began on Monday, Sept. 13. Jesse would receive the highest dose. Seventeen patients had already been treated, including one woman who had been given the same dose that Jesse would get, albeit from a different lot, and had done ''quite well,'' Raper says. That morning, Jesse was taken to the interventional-radiology suite, where he was sedated and strapped to a table while a team of radiologists threaded two catheters into his groin. At 10:30 a.m., Raper drew 30 milliliters of the vector and injected it slowly. At half past noon, he was done.

That night, Jesse was sick to his stomach and spiked a fever, 104.5 degrees. Raper was not particularly surprised: other patients had experienced the same reaction. Paul Gelsinger called; he and Jesse talked briefly, exchanging I love yous. Those were the last words they ever spoke.

Early Tuesday morning a nurse called Raper at home; Jesse seemed disoriented. When Raper got to the hospital, about 6:15 a.m., he noticed that the whites of Jesse's eyes were yellow. That meant jaundice, not a good sign. ''It was not something we had seen before,'' Raper says. A test confirmed that Jesse's bilirubin, a breakdown product of red blood cells, was four times the normal level. Raper called Gelsinger, and Batshaw in Washington, who said he would get on a train and be there in two hours.

Both doctors knew that the high bilirubin meant one of two things: either Jesse's liver was failing or he was suffering a clotting disorder in which his red blood cells were breaking down faster than the liver could metabolize them. This was the same disorder the scientists had seen in the monkeys that had been given the stronger vector. The condition is life-threatening for anyone, but particularly dangerous for someone with Jesse's disease, because red blood cells liberate protein when they break down.

By midafternoon Tuesday, a little more than 24 hours after the injection, the clotting disorder had pushed Jesse into a coma. By 11:30 p.m., his ammonia level was 393 micromoles per liter of blood. Normal is 35. The doctors began dialysis.

Paul Gelsinger had booked a red-eye flight. When he arrived in the surgical intensive care unit at 8 Wednesday morning, Raper and Batshaw told him that dialysis had brought Jesse's ammonia level down to 72 but that other complications were developing. He was hyperventilating, which would increase the level of ammonia in his brain. They wanted to paralyze his muscles and induce a deeper coma, so that a ventilator could breathe for him. Gelsinger gave consent. Then he put on scrubs, gloves and a mask and went in to see his son.

By Wednesday afternoon, Jesse seemed to be stabilizing. Batshaw went back to Washington. Paul felt comfortable enough to meet his brother for dinner. But later that night Jesse worsened again. His lungs grew stiff; the doctors were giving him 100 percent oxygen, but not enough of it was getting to his bloodstream. They consulted a liver-transplant team and learned that Jesse was not a good candidate. Raper was beside himself. He consulted with Batshaw and Wilson, and they decided to take an extraordinary step, a procedure known as ECMO, for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, essentially an external lung that filters the blood, removing carbon dioxide and adding oxygen. It had been tried on only 1,000 people before, Raper says. Only half had survived.

''If we could just buy his lungs a day or two,'' Raper said later, they thought ''maybe he would go ahead and heal up.''

The next day, Thursday, Sept. 16, Hurricane Floyd slammed into the East Coast. Mickie Gelsinger flew in from Tucson just before the airport closed. (Pattie Gelsinger, Jesse's mother, was being treated in a psychiatric facility and was unable to leave.) Batshaw spent the day trapped outside Baltimore on an Amtrak train. He ran down his cell phone calling Raper; when it went dead, he persuaded another passenger to lend him his. The ECMO, Raper reported, appeared to be working. But then another problem cropped up: Jesse's kidneys stopped making urine. ''He was sliding into multiple-organ-system failure,'' Raper says.

That night, at his hotel, Paul Gelsinger couldn't sleep. He left his wife a note and walked the half mile to the Penn medical center to see Jesse. The boy was bloated beyond recognition; even his ears were swollen shut. Gelsinger noticed blood in Jesse's urine, an indication, he knew, that the kidneys were shutting down. How can anybody, he thought, survive this?

On the morning of Friday the 17th, a test showed that Jesse was brain dead. Paul Gelsinger didn't need to be told: ''I knew it already.'' He called for a chaplain to hold a bedside service, with prayers for the removal of life support.

The room was crowded with equipment and people: 7 of Paul's 15 siblings came in, plus an array of doctors and nurses. Raper and Batshaw, shellshocked and exhausted, stood in the back. The chaplain anointed Jesse's forehead with oil, then read the Lord's Prayer. The doctors fought back tears. When the intensive-care specialist flipped two toggle switches, one to turn off the ventilator and the other to turn off the ECMO machine, Raper stepped forward. He checked the heart-rate monitor, watched the line go flat and noted the time: 2:30 p.m. He put his stethoscope to Jesse's chest, more out of habit than necessity, and pronounced the death official. ''Goodbye, Jesse,'' he said. ''We'll figure this out.''

Wilson reported the death immediately, drawing praise from government officials but criticism from Arthur Caplan, who says they should have made the news public, in a news conference. In the weeks since, the Penn team has put every detail of Jesse's treatment under a microscope. It has rechecked the vector to make certain it was not tainted, tested the same lot on monkeys, re-examined lab and autopsy findings. Wilson's biggest fear was that Jesse died as a result of human error, but so far there has been no evidence of that. ''That's what's so frightening,'' French Anderson says. ''If they made a mistake, you would feel a little safer.''

The death has rattled the three doctors in various ways. Wilson has asked himself over and over again whether he should have done anything differently. ''At this point, I say no, but I'm continuing to re-evaluate constantly.'' He has been besieged by worry, about the morale of his staff, about whether his institute's financial sponsors would pull out, about whether patients would continue to volunteer, about whether he would lose his bravado -- the death knell for a scientist on the cutting edge. ''My concern,'' he confessed, over dinner one night in Philadelphia, ''is, I'm going to get timid, that I'll get risk averse.''

Raper has thrown himself into his work, trying to live up to his promise to ''figure this out.'' There are a number of possible explanations, he says: the vector may have reacted badly with Jesse's medication; Jesse's status as a mosaic may have played a role; or perhaps the early testing in monkeys, which showed that the stronger vector had deleterious side effects, was more of a harbinger of danger than the doctors realized. An answer may take months, but he is determined to find one; only by understanding what happened to Jesse, and how to prevent it in others, can the research continue. ''That,'' Raper says, ''would be the best tribute to Jesse.''

Of the three, Batshaw seems to have taken it the hardest. He is not a particularly religious man, but a few days after Jesse died he went to synagogue to say Kaddish, the Jewish mourner's prayer. He struggles with the idea of personal responsibility. He has cradled many a dying child in his career, but never before, he says, has a patient been made worse by his care. ''What is the Hippocratic oath?'' Batshaw asks rhetorically, looking into the distance as his fingers drum the tabletop. He pauses, as if to steel himself, and says, ''I did harm.''

Paul Gelsinger does not hold the doctors responsible, although he is acutely interested in knowing what other scientists knew about adenovirus before Jesse died. He has experienced a deep spiritual awakening since losing his son; in dying, he says, Jesse taught him how to live. He speaks frequently of God, and of ''purity of intent,'' which is his way of saying that Jesse demonstrated an altruism the rest of us might do well to emulate. ''I hope,'' he said on the mountaintop that Sunday afternoon, ''that I can die as well as my son has died.''

Two decades of grappling with AIDS have taught scientists not only arcane lessons about the molecules that cause illness and the molecules that can treat it, but also some basic truths about the politics, economics, and psychology of health and disease.

AIDS exploded a scientific complacency that seems inconceivably naïve today. Few experts were ruminating about new plagues in the 1970's because it was widely assumed that vaccination, sanitation and antibiotics were making infections obsolete. The retroviruses, the family of viruses that includes the AIDS virus, H.I.V., were felt to be of academic interest only.

''The consensus was that retroviruses did not infect humans, that viruses did not cause cancer and that infectious diseases were a problem for the third world but not for us,'' said Dr. Robert C. Gallo, co-discoverer of the AIDS virus, who now directs the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute in Baltimore. ''Those biases were shattered in just a few years.''

The chain of medical events unleashed by H.I.V. is unique. The virus causes a turmoil in the body from the moment of infection on, appropriating enzymes in the infected person's own cells to spawn billions more viruses daily. These penetrate every human tissue and slowly destroy the integrity of the body's immune system.

The infected person can transmit the disease to others but looks and feels well: the infection is largely invisible until its last stages, a decade or more afterward, when a depleted immune system leaves its owner vulnerable to a range of infections and cancers. Drugs that stop the virus from replicating can keep infected people healthy but will not eradicate the infection.

In the years it took to figure this all out, experts in virtually every corner of science learned important lessons.

In addition to valuable nuances of cell biology, virologists have learned that viral infections can indeed be treated, Dr. Gallo said. Before AIDS, only a few primitive antiviral drugs existed. Most scientists thought that, because viruses use the body's cellular machinery to reproduce, developing better ones would be so difficult as to be ''almost hopeless,'' as well as prohibitively costly. With AIDS, the clear need for drugs outstripped the naysaying, and the success of the anti-H.I.V. drugs became a milestone in antiviral treatment.

Immunologists now have a far better understanding of the primary immune cells called T-lymphocytes that the virus particularly strikes, said Dr. Fred T. Valentine, a professor of medicine, infectious diseases and immunology at New York University. The complex links between cancer, immunity and infection have also been cemented by findings in H.I.V.-infected people, he said. And AIDS has re-educated the scientists in the importance of vaccines, he said.

Lessons at the bedside have been no less striking. AIDS taught doctors to be suspicious of their patients' private lives, delving for intimate autobiographical details -- a brief experiment with drugs, an unwise sexual encounter -- they would never have pursued in years past. AIDS has also taught them to be suspicious of their patients' blood, that supremely dangerous weapon: the disease forced complete overhauls of standard protocols for blood drawing, blood transfusion and organ transplantation, not to mention surgery and dentistry. Thanks to AIDS, a box of latex gloves now appears at every hospital bedside.

But if AIDS alienated doctors from patients with rude questions and latex barriers, it bound them together in other ways. In the early years of the epidemic, it rekindled many doctors' interest in the almost lost art of caring for dying patients. They were untethered from useless, life-prolonging machinery and allowed to die quietly. Medical ethicists agree that AIDS was a prime force in introducing living wills, health care proxies, do-not-resuscitate orders and hospice care into common parlance.

While patients dying from AIDS taught doctors some lessons, people living with it taught them others. AIDS has been the first disease on record to spawn a huge, vocal, visible, angry grass-roots patients' rights movement that managed to change the course of medical history.

Agitating for better, more available treatments, activists changed the process of drug approval in the United States, prompting the Food and Drug Administration to create a fast track for the rapid release of lifesaving medications. They changed the structure of scientific meetings, which now routinely allow patients to attend and participate. They changed the balance of power in doctors' offices, becoming collaborators in their own care -- a philosophy that has carried over to people with many other diseases.

AIDS taught scientists to look past their laboratory doors to a world that is both smaller and bigger than they may assume. The world has become so small that an African in the bush, a peasant in rural China and a prep-schooled, Ivy Leagued systems analyst in Manhattan can all see a doctor for exactly the same complaints, can all be given the same AIDS diagnosis and can all be recommended the same medications. The world is still so big that only one of these people will be treated.

''AIDS has taught us both the power of science and its limitations,'' said Dr. Gerald Friedland, professor of medicine at Yale and director of the AIDS program there. ''It has given us incredible technologic successes. But fully implementing those successes still escapes us.''

	Mutation That Slows H.I.V. May Play a Role in Hepatitis C


Five years ago, scientists discovered that some people had a genetic mutation in their cells that could either protect them against infection from the AIDS virus or significantly slow the course of AIDS.

Today, German scientists reported an odd twist to the mutation story. At the eighth annual retrovirus meeting here, they reported evidence suggesting that the mutation could have a negative effect for people infected with the hepatitis C virus, which causes potentially fatal liver disease.

Further research is needed. But the findings could have potential importance in the epidemiology of hepatitis C infections and the development of anti-H.I.V. drugs directed at the mutation, Dr. Rainer Woitas, the head of the German team from the University of Bonn, said in an interview.

The mutation involves the deletion of part of a gene on the surface of cells. The gene, CCR5, is one of the major receptor sites for the entry of H.I.V.

About 1 percent of Caucasians inherit a double dose of the mutation that usually confers resistance to H.I.V. infection. People who inherit only one dose of the mutation and become H.I.V.-infected often take about two years longer to develop AIDS than infected people without the mutation.

Dr. Woitas, a specialist in internal medicine with a long interest in hepatitis C, came to his findings in an unusual way. After other scientists in the United States and Europe discovered the mutation's effect in H.I.V. in 1996, Dr. Woitas theorized that it might also play a role in hepatitis C.

So he and his colleagues conducted tests to determine the frequency of the mutation among four groups. One group of 153 people had the  hepatitis C virus only. A second group of 102 people had H.I.V. only. A third group of 130 people had both infections. A fourth group of 102 people were blood donors with no known infections who were included for purposes of a scientific control.

Dr. Woitas's team confirmed the finding that the double dose form of the mutation protected against H.I.V. infection. But 12 of the 153, or 7.8 percent, in the hepatitis-C-only group had the mutation, and statistical tests showed it was three times more common than expected.

People with the mutation also had levels of hepatitis C virus in their blood about four times higher than in those without the mutation.

People with higher levels of a virus in the blood often fare worse than those with lower levels. But because the German studies were not developed to measure outcomes, Dr. Woitas said that additional studies were needed to document whether people with the mutation fared worse, and that they were under way.

Dr. Woitas theorized that the mutation interfered with the immune system in some unknown way to have an adverse effect on hepatitis C and the protective effect on H.I.V.

The study also led Dr. Woitas to speculate that the immune system might in some cases successfully defend against the hepatitis C virus and lose the antibodies. If so, he said, scientists would need to develop a new test to determine who had been infected with hepatitis C, since current tests screen for the infection by using antibodies to the virus.

	Scientists Report 2 Major Advances in Stem-Cell Research


Scientists report two major advances today in the concept of using embryonic cells to regenerate human tissues, results that are expected to sharpen the clash between advocates of biomedical research and opponents of abortion.

The advances come as the Bush administration, facing intense lobbying from the two sides, is reviewing the Clinton administration's proposal to let government-financed scientists proceed with the research.

In one of the reports, biologists at the National Institutes of Health used mouse embryonic stem cells to generate insulin-producing organs resembling the islets of the pancreas, a feat that holds promise for treating Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes.

In the other report, Rockefeller University biologists have proved in principle, though only in mice, the strange and once futuristic concept known as therapeutic cloning. The idea is to take an ordinary skin cell from a patient, convert it into an embryo and use the embryo's cells to repair any desired tissue of the patient's body. The embryo is destroyed in the process.

In this case the Rockefeller researchers chopped a tenth of an inch off the tails of mice and converted the tails' skin cells into embryonic stem cells. Colleagues at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center then made the stem cells morph into the dopamine-producing cells of the brain that are lost in Parkinson's disease.

Both studies are published in today's issue of Science.

The studies bolster hopes for a novel form of therapy referred to as regenerative medicine. Embryonic stem cells, taken from an embryo a few days old at the stage when it is a barely visible, hollow sphere of cells, are expected to play a central role in regenerative medicine since these powerful cells give rise to all the tissues of the adult body.

Probably as a defense against cancer, the body's adult cells are kept under tight leash and cannot divide very much or change into different types of cells. This constraint severely limits the aging body's ability to regenerate its organs and tissues, even though the information to do so still resides in every cell's genes.

But embryonic stem cells should be able to generate all medically desired new tissues, once biologists can find the right natural signals to coax them into any desired cell type. Though human embryonic stem cells were first obtained in 1998, almost all work on the cells is being done in mice, in part because federal financing for work on human embryonic cells has been in abeyance because of objections by abortion opponents, and in part because the mouse is a quicker and more practical test bed for working out the new principles.

Today's work with pancreatic cells, conducted by Nadya Lumelsky, Ron McKay and others in Dr. McKay's laboratory at the National Institutes of Health, lays the basis for a novel treatment of Type 1 diabetes, a disease in which the pancreas fails to produce insulin. The researchers devised a novel procedure for driving mouse embryonic stem cells down the particular line of development that leads to a pancreatic precursor cell. These precursor cells formed at least four types of pancreatic cells, including those that secrete insulin and two other hormones known as glucagon and somatostatin.

The different cell types then combined with each other in much the same architecture as do cells in the islets of the pancreas. This seems to be the first time that a miniature organ has been coaxed to form from embryonic stem cells, proof that in the right circumstances the body is a self-assembling system.

The islet-like structures produced insulin when exposed to glucose. When injected under the skin of diabetic mice, they induced the body to build a blood supply to them and enabled the mice to live longer. They did not produce enough insulin to cure the mice; Dr. McKay said more work was needed to mature the cells.

Last year Canadian researchers reported that transplants of human islet cells from donor organs had freed eight patients from the chore of daily insulin injections. There are not enough donor organs to treat the 16 million Americans who suffer from Type 1 diabetes. But if fully functional, islet-like structures could be generated from human embryonic stem cells, supply would not be a problem.

Dr. Lumelsky is trying to replicate the mouse work in human cells. Because researchers cannot use federal money to work on human embryonic stem cells, she has moved to the Harvard laboratory of Dr. Douglas A. Melton, who studies the cells with support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

Dr. Melton said it was a burden, not a privilege, to be one of the few researchers able to work with human embryonic stem cells. ''A result like Ron McKay's makes one see what kind of potential is going to be shut off by not funding this research,'' Dr. Melton said. ''This is such an exciting area, not just for diabetes but for many other diseases, that rather than limiting the funds, one should aggressively pursue a line of research that holds such enormous promise.''

Similiar frustration was expressed by Dr. Robert Goldstein, chief scientific officer of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. He said his organization was ''very distressed,'' both that the large and expert corps of government-financed medical researchers were unable to work on the cells, and that the research now legally proceeding in the private sector lacked the benefit of public oversight. ''Our magnificent biomedical research enterprise won't be working in this area, Dr. Goldstein said. ''We think that is very unfortunate.''

Abortion opponents object to the fact that embryonic stem cells are derived by destroying embryos and advocate using a different class of stem cell, known as adult stem cells, which are found in various adult tissues. But adult stem cells are less versatile; none can yet be converted into the tissues needed to treat diabetes and Parkinson's.

Today's other report proves that therapeutic cloning works in mice, although the researchers have yet to inject the dopamine-producing cells they created into the brains of mice with Parkinson's disease to see if symptoms are relieved. The creation of mouse embryonic stem cells from mouse skin cells was carried out by Dr. Teruhiko Wakayama and colleagues in the Rockefeller University laboratory of Dr. Peter Mombaerts. Dr. Lorenz Studer at Sloan-Kettering converted the embryonic cells into brain cells.

But to take therapeutic cloning from mice to people will not be simple. The mouse skin cell is converted to embryonic form by removing its nucleus and inserting it into a mouse egg whose own nucleus has been removed, the same process that was used in cloning Dolly the sheep. This egg is allowed to develop for a few days in glassware until it is a hollow sphere of some 120 cells. From these cells, which would form all the tissues of the mouse's body, embryonic cells are derived.

The same process in people might require a human egg cell to reprogram the skin cell nucleus. The embryo thus created could in principle be brought to term if inserted in a uterus, a procedure that would lead to cloning the person. Under therapeutic cloning, however, the embryo would instead be destroyed in order to create embryonic stem cells.  Therapeutic cloning with human cells has been approved in Britain but in the United States it would not  be permitted for researchers financed by the National Institutes of Health, even if the Bush administration were to let research with embryonic stem cells proceed.

	A CONVERSATION WITH -- Douglas Melton; At Harvard's Stem Cell Center, the Barriers Run Deep and Wide


To enter his laboratory at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute here, Douglas Melton must use a special key card that electronically checks his identity.

Even before President Bush barred federal financing for most human embryonic stem cell research in August 2001, the work of Dr. Melton was mired in controversy.

And once the ban was enacted, a new set of barriers rose, extending the scientists' challenges far beyond the test tube.

At Dr. Melton's lab, embryonic stem cells from fertilized human eggs are part of a search for a cure to Type 1 diabetes.

Though Dr. Melton's research is privately financed, he must certify that no federal money supports any of his efforts. Hence the key cards. They provide a kind of barrier against people and things that have a federal tie.

''Running a stem cell lab is a little like keeping a kosher kitchen: you've got to really keep things separate,'' said Dr. Melton, who is 52. ''Actually, a kosher kitchen is probably easier.''

Q. Last month, after the Korean stem cell cloning scandal broke, a Roman Catholic scientist-theologian, the Rev. Tadeusz Pacholczyk, told The Boston Globe that too many researchers in this renegade branch of science had been playing down the grave ethical concerns for much too long. What is your response?

A. My first response is, There's nothing unethical about what we're doing here. We think embryonic stem cells can be made to become pancreatic beta cells and that they will be able to help diabetics produce their own insulin. I've never once doubted the morality of this work.

This is all about differing religious beliefs. I don't believe I have the right to tell others when life begins. Science doesn't have the answer to that question; it's metaphysical.

Now it's true, we use fertilized human eggs to derive embryonic stem cells. And those fertilized eggs have the potential, under certain circumstances, to become a living person. There are many who believe that there's a moral imperative to use that potential to try to help living sick people.

I hold with them.

Q. You have a child at home with diabetes, right?

A. It's a little bit uncomfortable to talk about this. But it's not a secret. My interest was, for many years, in basic embryology.

When my son, Samuel, was about 6 months old, he came down with Type 1 diabetes, which means that his pancreas couldn't make insulin. About four years ago, my daughter came down with this same disease.

Like any parent, I asked myself, What can I do? The answer was to shift my research to an area that might help them.

I wanted my children to know I was doing everything I could for them.

Q. Does the Korean stem call scandal surrounding the stem cell research of Hwang Woo Suk make your work harder?

A. It has to raise, in the public's mind, the question as to whether there's legitimacy to this kind of science. Fortunately, stem cell research is not dependent on one discovery. Even though Hwang's findings turned out to be fraudulent, nothing he claimed was a fundamental challenge to the principles of embryonic stem cell research.

Hwang claimed to have successfully cloned human embryos, which was only a technical accomplishment. It's something that's already been done in animals.

If you ask me what really holds this research back, I'd say that the policies of the Bush administration have affected us more significantly than the Hwang debacle. The lack of federal support keeps many of America's brightest young scientists from working in this area.

Q. Were you ever skeptical of Dr. Hwang as he reported a succession of breakthroughs in human stem cell research?

A. I'd like to tell you I suspected something. I didn't. When his papers were published, I read them carefully. I was impressed by the speed and the efficiency by which he'd cloned a human embryo. We hadn't done those experiments ourselves. So I didn't know how difficult it would be in humans.

I met Dr. Hwang and his colleagues several times. He didn't seem nutty, squirrely or deceptive or anything like that.

Q. How exactly has President Bush's ban on federal financing for most embryonic stem cell study affected your research?

A. It made it more difficult, to say the least. Long before Bush's speech, we had planned stem cell experiments. Afterward, we were able to go forward because the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Juvenile Diabetes Association and Harvard alumni provided private funding.

However, because of administration policy, we had to set up this whole new laboratory that was separate from everything else here at Harvard.

And we had to separate the money in a really scrupulous way. We have an accountant who makes sure that not a penny of federal funds goes to embryonic stem cell research. We have separate everything -- light bulbs, computers, centrifuges.

This can be burdensome. Most of the activities at this university receive federal money in some indirect way. So you have to ask yourself, ''How can you do the research without any imprint of federal funding?''

And we're not just talking about equipment and real estate; it's people. Let's suppose there's a graduate student who's receiving a federally funded fellowship, can he or she participate in thinking about this research or even look at the data? The answer is no.

Q. Some say that your laboratory's existence proves that the Bush administration's directive didn't stop research in this controversial area. Are they right?

A. Listen, I'm a tenured professor at Harvard, where I have a president who backs my freedom of inquiry -- and puts money behind it. If I'd been at a state college, it would have been a different story. Though some states are now keen to support stem cell research, state governments, at first, were very worried.

The bottom line here is that it's unlikely that one person or one lab will solve a problem as big as degenerative diseases, which is what stem cell researchers are trying to do.

It takes a community of people in an area to solve a big problem. If you were trying to solve cancer at two places, no one would think that was enough.

Q. Your lab created 30 stem cell lines and offered them free to any scientist who wanted them. Why?

A. Because in his speech, President Bush said that he was going to permit federal funding for scientists to work with some 60 pre-existing stem cell lines and it turned out that there were probably only about 10 usable lines. Maybe a few more.

And many of those were problematic. Some had abnormal chromosomes, like a cancer cell might. If you're using stem cells to create pancreatic beta or muscle or nerve cells, you want to begin with high-quality normal cells.

All the pre-existing lines were grown with mouse cells -- which probably means you can't ever use them with human patients to treat diseases. Some of the lines, when researchers asked for them, came from a biotech company or some investigator who wanted to impose onerous restrictions on their use.

So we made our cell lines because we thought there aren't enough human stem cell lines around for researchers to really explore their properties.

We offered them free of charge because there's a long scientific tradition of making the fruits of one's research available to others.

Q. How far have you gotten in your quest to find a way to make pancreatic cells that will produce insulin for patients?

A. I'd say we've made progress. We don't know exactly how much because we don't yet know how many pieces there are in the puzzle we're trying to solve. I'm an optimist, though. I don't think we'll fail.

	From Light to Darkness: Astronomy's New Universe


A gasp went through the auditorium of the Space Telescope Science Institute on Wednesday when Dr. Adam Riess, a young astronomer from the institute, put the last mark on his so-called Hubble diagram, a plot of the brightness and speed of distant objects that astronomers use to divine the history of the universe.

The Darth Vaders of astronomy had gathered here to take stock of their expanding and increasingly dark realm. Once upon a time astronomy was about what could be seen in the sky, about jewel-like lights that moved in eternally recurring patterns and the soft glow of galaxies and comets.

Now it is about what cannot be seen. In the last few decades astronomers have had to confront the possibility that stars and galaxies -- not to mention the creatures that inhabit them -- are barely more than flecks of froth on a stormy sea of dark matter.

Now Dr. Riess was presenting his colleagues with evidence, based on observations of a star that exploded 11 billion years ago, that the universe -- dark matter and all -- was being blown apart under the influence of a mysterious antigravitational force known only as ''dark energy.''

''We are doing astronomy of the invisible,'' admitted Dr. Mario Livio, a theorist at the Space Telescope institute, who had organized the meeting, called ''The Dark Universe: Matter, Energy, and Gravity'' last fall.

As it turned out, the meeting coincided with a NASA news conference announcing the breakthrough discovery by Dr. Riess and his colleagues and thus was dominated by discussions of new telescopes in space and new dimensions in the universe as astronomers grappled with the meaning of dark energy and how to take its measure.

Now physicists, some of whom have been reluctant to take acceleration of the universe seriously, will have to explain what this dark energy is. ''Those numbers are alarming, and apparently true,'' said Dr. Michael Dine, a theoretical physicist from the University of California at Santa Cruz. He described his colleagues as now working ''frantically'' to find an explanation.

On one level, the universe, with all of its dark baggage, seems to make sense. The total amount of matter and energy seems to be just enough to guarantee  that the large-scale geometry of space-time is ''flat,'' or Euclidean, a result that cosmologists have long considered to be the most desirable and aesthetic. On the other hand, the detailed breakdown of the constituents of the cosmos is, as Dr. Livio says, ''ugly'' -- 65 percent dark matter, 30 percent dark matter of unknown nature and only 5 percent stars, gas and dust.

''We live in a preposterous universe,'' said Dr. Michael Turner, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago. ''Dark energy. Who ordered that?''

Of course, it was Einstein who originally ordered dark energy when he inserted a fudge factor called the cosmological constant into his gravitational equations describing the universe. Lambda, as it is known, after the Greek letter, represented a sort of cosmic repulsion associated with space itself that kept the cosmos from collapsing of its own weight. Einstein abandoned the cosmological constant when it was discovered that the universe was expanding, and resisted efforts to bring it back, once referring to it as his biggest blunder.

But he couldn't keep it out forever. In 1998 two competing teams of astronomers trying to measure how the expansion of the universe was slowing down because of cosmic gravity, found that the universe was actually speeding up, as if the galaxies were being pushed apart by a force -- dubbed, in the spirit of the times, ''dark energy.''

''This was a very strange result,'' recalled Dr. Riess, who was a member of one of the teams. ''It was the opposite of what we thought we were doing.'' Was this Einstein's old cosmological constant, something even weirder or a mistake?

The effect had showed up as an unexpected dimness on the part of certain exploding stars known as supernovae that the astronomers were using as so-called standard candles, objects whose distance could be gauged from their apparent brightness. The astronomers deduced that these stars were farther away than  they should have been in an evenly expanding universe, and that therefore the expansion was actually accelerating.

But dust or chemical changes over the eons in the stars could also have dimmed the supernovae. The cleanest test of dark energy and the acceleration hypothesis, Dr. Riess explained, would be to find supernovae even farther out and back into the past, halfway or more back to the Big Bang itself. Because it is space itself that provides the repulsive push, according to Einstein's equations, that push should start out small when the universe is small and grow as the universe expands. Cosmic acceleration would only kick in when lambda's push got big enough to dominate the gravity of ordinary matter and energy in the universe, about five or six billion years ago. Before then the universe would have been slowing down, like a Mark McGwire blast that has not yet reached the top of its trajectory, and a supernova glimpsed at that great distance would appear relatively brighter than it should. If dust or chemical evolution were responsible, such distant stars should appear relatively even dimmer.

By chance the Hubble Space Telescope had observed a supernova in late 1997 and early 1998 that proved to be 11 billion light-years away -- the most distant yet seen. On Dr. Riess's Hubble diagram it appeared twice as bright as it should.

''Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence -- I hope the I.R.S. doesn't say that to you,'' Dr. Riess told his audience, but, he concluded, ''the cosmological constant looks good for this supernova.''

Dr. Livio said, ''A year ago probably a large fraction of the people in this room would not have believed it.''

But there were more complicated explanations, forms of dark energy other than the cosmological constant on physicists' drawing boards, as well as the possibility that astronomers were still being fooled. To explicate the nature of the dark energy, astronomers need to observe more supernovae as far back as 11 billion years ago, to cover the time when the universe began to accelerate.

''How fast did it go from deceleration to acceleration?'' asked Dr. Riess. Answering such questions could help astronomers determine how hard the dark energy is pushing on the universe compared with the predictions for the cosmological constant. A fast turnaround, he said, ''begins to tell you there is a lot of oomph for a given amount of 'it.' ''

''The cosmological constant is the benchmark oomph,'' he said.

To find those supernovae so far out cosmologists will have to go to space, said Dr. Saul Perlmutter, a physicist at the University of California's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a veteran dark energy hunter.

On the ground, the supernova researchers have to employ a wide network of people and telescopes to detect the explosions, diagnose their type and then to watch them fade. Dr. Perlmutter described an orbiting  telescope that would perform all three functions. The Supernova/Acceleration Probe, or SNAP, would combine an 80-inch diameter mirror (only about 16 percent smaller than the Hubble), a giant electronic camera with a billion pixels and a special spectroscope.

If all goes well, Dr. Perlmutter said, the telescope could be launched in 2008. In three years of operation, he estimated, SNAP could harvest about 2,000 supernovae. To distinguish the different ideas about dark energy, observations would have to be refined to the level of 1 or 2 percent uncertainty .

''We're all excited,'' he said.

So are the physicists. Their list of suspects begins with Einstein's cosmological constant, but therein lies a problem. About the time that Einstein was abandoning it, quantum mechanics -- the set of rules that govern the subatomic realm -- was establishing a theoretical foundation for the cosmological constant. According to quantum theory, empty space should be foaming with temporary particles and their cumulative energy would outweigh the matter in the universe, including dark matter, by 120 orders of magnitude -- that is, a factor of 10 followed by 119 zeros. At that level, the force of the vacuum would either have crumpled the universe or blown it apart before even an atom had the chance to form.

The fact that the universe is in fact puttering along rather gently suggests that there is something fundamental about physics and the universe that physicists still don't know. Dr. Steven Weinberg, the Nobel Prize-winning particle theorist at the University of Texas, has called the cosmological constant ''the bone in our throat.'' If the dark energy really is Einstein's cosmological constant, then physicists have to answer questions like why it is so small -- roughly comparable, in fact, to the density of matter in our own epoch.

Lacking an answer so far, even from string theory, the mathematically daunting candidate theory of everything, some theorists have resorted to a controversial and somewhat philosophical notion called the anthropic principle, which, in effect, says that physicists need to factor in their own existence when they think about the universe. Out of all the possible universes that can be imagined, this line of thinking goes, the only ones in which humans can find themselves is one that is conducive to human life.

That means, Dr. Weinberg has  pointed out, that the cosmological constant has to be small enough to allow time for galaxies and stars to condense from the primordial fog before it takes over and starts blowing the universe apart.

Dr. Alex Vilenkin of Tufts University in Massachusetts pointed out to the Dark Universe audience that the universe was at its peak in making stars about five billion or six billion years ago, just about the time that dark energy and the matter density would have been equal. Our own sun, some 4.5 billion years old, was on the tale end of that wave, and now here we are. ''Observers are where the galaxies are,'' said Dr. Vilenkin. ''A typical observer will see a small cosmological constant.''

Many physicists are uncomfortable with this line of reasoning, and they are seeking the answer in different class of theories known as quintessence, after the Greek word for the fifth element. Modern physics, noted Dr. Paul Steinhardt, a theorist at Princeton, is replete with mysterious energy fields that would exhibit negative gravity. The trick, Dr. Steinhardt explained, is finding a field that would act like the dark energy without a lot of fudging on the part of theorists.

''The observations are forcing us to do this,'' he said. ''Dark energy is an interesting problem. Any solution is quite interesting.''

One theory that captured the fancy of the astronomers in Baltimore was a modification of gravity recently proposed by three string theorists at New York University: Dr. Gia Dvali, Dr. Gregory Gabadadze and Dr. Massimo Porrati. In string theory -- so named because it describes elementary particles as tiny vibrating strings -- the ordinary world is often envisioned as a three-dimensional island (a membrane, or ''brane'' in string jargon) floating in a 10- or 11-dimensional space. Ordinary particles like electrons and quarks and forces like electromagnetism are confined to three dimensions, to the brane, but gravity is not.

As a result, Dr. Dvali suggested that gravity could only travel so far through conventional space before it leaked off into the extra dimensions, thereby weakening itself. To an observer in the traditional three dimensions it looks as if the universe is accelerating. The cosmological constant, in effect, he said, is a kind of gravitational brane drain. ''Gravity fools itself,'' he said. ''It sees itself as a cosmological constant.''

Dr. Dvali's theory was welcomed by the astronomers as a sign that string theory was beginning to come down from its ivory tower of abstraction and make useful, testable predictions about the real world. (In another string contribution, Dr. Steinhardt introduced a new theory of the early universe, in which the Big Bang is set off by a pair of branes clashing together like cymbals.)

Afterward Dr. Riess and Dr. Perlmutter pressed Dr. Dvali on what they would see when they looked out past the crossover point where gravity began falling out of the world; would the transition between a decelerating universe and an accelerating one happen more abruptly than in the case of the cosmological constant? Dr. Dvali said he hadn't done any calculations, but he said it was his ''naïve guess'' that the crossover would happen more smoothly than in a lambda world.

''I'd love to see this guy do some Hubble diagrams,'' Dr. Riess said.

Even if Dr. Dvali could be coaxed into providing a prediction, however, success in identifying the dark energy was not guaranteed to the astronomers. Calling himself a spokesman for the ''cranky point of view,'' Dr. Steinhardt pointed out that the oft-proclaimed era of ''precision cosmology'' was bound to have its limits. Other cosmological parameters, particularly the cosmic density of matter in the universe, were not likely to be known well enough for even SNAP to untangle the models in which the quintessence varied over time. Worried that the overselling of SNAP could sap astronomers' will to come up with new ideas, he said, ''We should try to make as few pronouncements as possible.''

Dr. Turner refused to be swayed from his ''irrational exuberance.'' Appealing to the astronomers' pride, he urged them to be ambitious. ''We have a chance to do fundamental physics here,'' he said. ''Let's see if we can crack this nut. Maybe we'll fall on our faces. Maybe cranky Paul is right.

''I still have a lot of youthful juices in my body.''

	Photo Gives Weight To Einstein's Thesis Of Negative Gravity


A photograph of a distant exploding star has given astronomers the first direct evidence that a mysterious ''negative gravity'' force swept through and still pervades the universe, scientists announced at a NASA news conference yesterday in Washington.

The Hubble Space Telescope by chance photographed the exploding star, the most distant ever observed, in 1997. Scientists say subsequent detective work on the relative intensity of its light confirms one of Einstein's conjectures about the universe: that all of space is bubbling with an invisible form of energy that creates a mutual repulsion between objects normally attracted to each other by gravity.

Einstein himself thought the force, which he called the cosmological constant, was so strange that he later repudiated his conjecture. But the idea gained theoretical support in 1998 with findings suggesting that the expansion of the universe was accelerating and that the force accelerating the expansion, negative gravity -- the manifestation of the cosmological constant -- overtook the force of gravity in the last few billion years.

The new findings confirm that crucial part of the theory. And they rule out several competing explanations.

Because the amount of negative gravity in any given volume should be minuscule, its effects would not be felt in everyday life. But over vast distances involving huge volumes of space, the effect would be powerful enough to push galaxies and clusters of galaxies apart from one another.

Exploding stars, or supernovas, like the one that turned up unexpectedly on a photograph made by the Hubble telescope, can be excellent probes of those grand forces. The new observation is of a star that exploded about 11 billion years ago, when the universe was a quarter of its present age and when, scientists theorized, the cosmological constant, often called ''dark energy,'' was less powerful than gravity, the opposite of what prevails today.

As a result, the expansion of the universe was slowing at that time. This meant that the star was closer to earth when it exploded than it would have been if dark energy had dominated gravity then -- a fact discernable in its brightness. Astronomers said it was twice as bright as it would have been under competing theories about the universe.

A team led by Dr. Adam G. Riess, an astrophysist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore  analyzed the data. Dr. Riess, who worked with Dr. Peter E. Nugent of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said the measurement ''nails the existence of the dark energy.''

Dr. Michael S. Turner, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago not involved in the work, called the dark energy ''one of the most important discoveries in all of science.''

''If Einstein were around today, he would get another Nobel Prize for his prediction of repulsive gravity,'' Dr. Turner said.

He added that research would now shift to a hunt for the source of the energy and efforts to observe many other distant supernovas to pin down the characteristics of the dark energy.

The universe is expanding as a legacy of its violent birth, which is believed to have occurred in a great explosion or ''big bang'' roughly 14 billion years ago. Until recently, scientists were all but certain that the gravitational attraction among the galaxies would slow the expansion.

But in 1998, two teams began presenting data on supernovas that they had observed as a way to measure the change in the expansion rate over the last few billion years. They used a class of supernovas that explode with nearly the same brightness each time, like bulbs of a known  wattage. This constancy enabled scientists to measure the speed at which the expansion of the universe had swept these supernovas away: the dimmer they appeared from earth, the farther away they were.

Those observations revealed unexpectedly dim supernovas, suggesting that something, perhaps clouds of cosmic dust, was obscuring them or that they were farther away than expected, perhaps driven away by an anti-gravity force.

To find the explanation, astronomers tried to observe objects so distant that their light had been traveling to Earth for billions of years.

''You need things that you can see across to the other side of the universe,'' Dr. Nugent said.

If cosmic dust were dimming this light, they reasoned, the objects would be dimmer the farther they were from Earth. But if Einstein's explanation were correct, extremely distant supernovas should appear to brighten relative to some standard, rather than continuing to dim.

Because they are so faint and are obscured by Earth's atmosphere,  very distant supernova explosions are rarely seen. But a break came in 1997 when teams led by Dr. Ronald L. Gilliland of the space telescope institute and Dr. Mark Phillips of the Carnegie Institution of Washington made long-exposure Hubble photographs of a tiny part of the sky. The pictures revealed a supernova in the distant gloom of space.

A difficult and time-consuming analysis of light from the star showed that it was twice as bright as it would have been if cosmic dust had been obscuring it or, as another hypothesis held, if supernovas had somehow evolved steadily in brightness over the history of the cosmos.

The finding, said Dr. Saul Perlmutter, a physicist and supernova-hunter at the Berkeley laboratory not involved in the work, was ''not very consistent with simple dust or evolution models.''

''That's the standout story here,'' Dr. Perlmutter said.

Cosmologists will have to cope with a universe that seems increasingly filled with mysterious stuff that scientists cannot see and do not fully understand. The dark energy joins dark matter as an invisible constituent of the cosmos. Dark matter's  gravitational effects are known, and  despite its invisibility it is presumed to give the universe much of its mass.

Physicists will try to explain the source and exact nature of the dark energy. Dr. Turner said these questions appeared to lie at the crossroads of several of the most important problems in physics.

''In 'The Graduate,' that guy told young Dustin Hoffman, 'plastics,' '' Dr. Turner said. ''My advice to the next generation of particle physicists and astrophysicists: dark energy.''

	On Autism's Cause, It's Parents vs. Research


Kristen Ehresmann, a Minnesota Department of Health official, had just told a State Senate hearing that vaccines with microscopic amounts of mercury were safe. Libby Rupp, a mother of a 3-year-old girl with autism, was incredulous.

''How did my daughter get so much mercury in her?'' Ms. Rupp asked Ms. Ehresmann after her testimony.

''Fish?'' Ms. Ehresmann suggested.

''She never eats it,'' Ms. Rupp answered.

''Do you drink tap water?''

''It's all filtered.''

''Well, do you breathe the air?'' Ms. Ehresmann asked, with a resigned smile. Several parents looked angrily at Ms. Ehresmann, who left.

Ms. Rupp remained, shaking with anger. That anyone could defend mercury in vaccines, she said, ''makes my blood boil.''

Public health officials like Ms. Ehresmann, who herself has a son with autism, have been trying for years to convince parents like Ms. Rupp that there is no link between thimerosal -- a mercury-containing preservative once used routinely in vaccines -- and autism.

They have failed.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the Institute of Medicine, the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics have all largely dismissed the notion that thimerosal causes or contributes to autism. Five major studies have found no link.

Yet despite all evidence to the contrary, the number of parents who blame thimerosal for their children's autism has only increased. And in recent months, these parents have used their numbers, their passion and their organizing skills to become a potent national force. The issue has become one of the most fractious and divisive in pediatric medicine.

''This is like nothing I've ever seen before,'' Dr. Melinda Wharton, deputy director of the National Immunization Program, told a gathering of immunization officials in Washington in March. ''It's an era where it appears that science isn't enough.''

Parents have filed more than 4,800 lawsuits -- 200 from February to April alone -- pushed for state and federal legislation banning thimerosal and taken out full-page advertisements in major newspapers. They have also gained the support of politicians, including Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, and Representatives Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, and Dave Weldon, Republican of Florida. And Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote an article in the June 16 issue of Rolling Stone magazine arguing that most studies of the issue are flawed and that public health officials are conspiring with drug makers to cover up the damage caused by thimerosal.

''We're not looking like a fringe group anymore,'' said Becky Lourey, a Minnesota state senator and a sponsor of a proposed thimerosal ban. Such a ban passed the New York State Legislature this week.

But scientists and public health officials say they are alarmed by the surge of attention to an idea without scientific merit. The anti-thimerosal campaign, they say, is causing some parents to stay away from vaccines, placing their children at risk for illnesses like measles and polio.

''It's really terrifying, the scientific illiteracy that supports these suspicions,'' said Dr. Marie McCormick, chairwoman of an Institute of Medicine panel that examined the controversy in February 2004.

Experts say they are also concerned about a raft of unproven, costly and potentially harmful treatments -- including strict diets, supplements and a detoxifying technique called chelation -- that are being sold for tens of thousands of dollars to desperate parents of autistic children as a cure for ''mercury poisoning.''

In one case, a doctor forced children to sit in a 160-degree sauna, swallow 60 to 70 supplements a day and have so much blood drawn that one child passed out.

Hundreds of doctors list their names on a Web site endorsing chelation to treat autism, even though experts say that no evidence supports its use with that disorder. The treatment carries risks of liver and kidney damage, skin rashes and nutritional deficiencies, they say.

In recent months, the fight over thimerosal has become even more bitter. In response to a barrage of threatening letters and phone calls, the centers for disease control has increased security and instructed employees on safety issues, including how to respond if pies are thrown in their faces. One vaccine expert at the centers wrote in an internal e-mail message that she felt safer working at a malaria field station in Kenya than she did at the agency's offices in Atlanta.

An Alarm Is Sounded

Thimerosal was for decades the favored preservative for use in vaccines. By weight, it is about 50 percent ethyl mercury, a form of mercury most scientists consider to be less toxic than methyl mercury, the type found in fish. The amount of ethyl mercury included in each childhood vaccine was once roughly equal to the amount of methyl mercury found in the average tuna sandwich.

In 1999, a Food and Drug Administration scientist added up all the mercury that American infants got with a full immunization schedule and concluded that the amount exceeded a government guideline. Some health authorities counseled no action, because there was no evidence that thimerosal at the doses given was harmful and removing it might cause alarm. Others were not so certain that thimerosal was harmless.

In July 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Public Health Service released a joint statement urging vaccine makers to remove thimerosal as quickly as possible. By 2001, no vaccine routinely administered to children in the United States had more than half of a microgram of mercury -- about what is found in an infant's daily supply of breast milk.

Despite the change, government agencies say that vaccines with thimerosal are just as safe as those without, and adult flu vaccines still contain the preservative.

But the 1999 advisory alarmed many parents whose children suffered from autism, a lifelong disorder marked by repetitive, sometimes self-destructive behaviors and an inability to form social relationships. In 10 to 25 percent of cases, autism seems to descend on young children seemingly overnight, sometime between their first and second birthdays.

Diagnoses of autism have risen sharply in recent years, from roughly 1 case for every 10,000 births in the 1980's to 1 in 166 births in 2003.

Most scientists believe that the illness is influenced strongly by genetics but that some unknown environmental factor may also play a role.

Dr. Tom Insel, director of the National Institute for Mental Health, said: ''Is it cellphones? Ultrasound? Diet sodas? Every parent has a theory. At this point, we just don't know.''

In 2000, a group of parents joined together to found SafeMinds, one of several organizations that argue that thimerosal is that environmental culprit. Their cause has been championed by politicians like Mr. Burton.

''My grandson received nine shots in one day, seven of which contained thimerosal, which is 50 percent mercury as you know, and he became autistic a short time later,'' he said in an interview.

In a series of House hearings held from 2000 through 2004, Mr. Burton called the leading experts who assert that vaccines cause autism to testify. They included a chemistry professor at the University of Kentucky who says that dental fillings cause or exacerbate autism and other diseases and a doctor from Baton Rouge, La., who says that God spoke to her through an 87-year-old priest and told her that vaccines caused autism.

Also testifying were Dr. Mark Geier and his son, David Geier, the experts whose work is most frequently cited by parents.

Trying to Build a Case

Dr. Geier has called the use of thimerosal in vaccines the world's ''greatest catastrophe that's ever happened, regardless of cause.''

He and his son live and work in a two-story house in suburban Maryland. Past the kitchen and down the stairs is a room with cast-off, unplugged laboratory equipment, wall-to-wall carpeting and faux wood paneling that Dr. Geier calls ''a world-class lab -- every bit as good as anything at N.I.H.''

Dr. Geier has been examining issues of vaccine safety since at least 1971, when he was a lab assistant at the National Institutes of Health, or N.I.H. His résumé lists scores of publications, many of which suggest that vaccines cause injury or disease.

He has also testified in more than 90 vaccine cases, he said, although a judge in a vaccine case in 2003 ruled that Dr. Geier was ''a professional witness in areas for which he has no training, expertise and experience.''

In other cases, judges have called Dr. Geier's testimony ''intellectually dishonest,'' ''not reliable'' and ''wholly unqualified.''

The six published studies by Dr. Geier and David Geier on the relationship between autism and thimerosal are largely based on complaints sent to the disease control centers by people who suspect that their children were harmed by vaccines.

In the first study, the Geiers compared the number of complaints associated with a thimerosal-containing vaccine, given from 1992 to 2000, with the complaints that resulted from a thimerosal-free version given from 1997 to 2000. The more thimerosal a child received, they concluded, the more likely an autism complaint was filed. Four other studies used similar methods and came to similar conclusions.

Dr. Geier said in an interview that the link between thimerosal and autism was clear.

Public health officials, he said, are '' just trying to cover it up.''

Assessing the Studies

Scientists say that the Geiers' studies are tainted by faulty methodology.

''The problem with the Geiers' research is that they start with the answers and work backwards,'' said Dr. Steven Black, director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in Oakland, Calif. ''They are doing voodoo science.''

Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, the director of the disease control centers, said the agency was not withholding information about any potentially damaging effects of thimerosal.

''There's certainly not a conspiracy here,'' she said. ''And we would never consider not acknowledging information or evidence that would have a bearing on children's health.''

In 2003, spurred by parents' demands, the C.D.C. asked the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences and the nation's most prestigious medical advisory group, to review the evidence on thimerosal and autism.

In a report last year, a panel convened by the institute dismissed the Geiers' work as having such serious flaws that their studies were ''uninterpretable.'' Some of the Geiers' mathematical formulas, the committee found, ''provided no information,'' and the Geiers used basic scientific terms like ''attributable risk'' incorrectly.

In contrast, the committee found five studies that examined hundreds of thousands of health records of children in the United States, Britain, Denmark and Sweden to be persuasive.

A study by the World Health Organization, for example, examined the health records of 109,863 children born in Britain from 1988 to 1997 and found that children who had received the most thimerosal in vaccines had the lowest incidence of developmental problems like autism.

Another study examined the records of 467,450 Danish children born from 1990 to 1996. It found that after 1992, when the country's only thimerosal-containing vaccine was replaced by one free of the preservative, autism rates rose rather than fell.

In one of the most comprehensive studies, a 2003 report by C.D.C. scientists examined the medical records of more than 125,000 children born in the United States from 1991 to 1999. It found no difference in autism rates among children exposed to various amounts of thimerosal.

Parent groups, led by SafeMinds, replied that documents obtained from the disease control centers showed that early versions of the study had found a link between thimerosal and autism.

But C.D.C. researchers said that it was not unusual for studies to evolve as more data and controls were added. The early versions of the study, they said, failed to control for factors like low birth weight, which increases the risk of developmental delays.

The Institute of Medicine said that it saw ''nothing inherently troubling'' with the C.D.C.'s adjustments and concluded that thimerosal did not cause autism. Further studies, the institute said, would not be ''useful.''

Threats and Conspiracy Talk

Since the report's release, scientists and health officials have been bombarded with hostile e-mail messages and phone calls. Dr. McCormick, the chairwoman of the institute's panel, said she had received threatening mail claiming that she was part of a conspiracy. Harvard University has increased security at her office, she said.

An e-mail message to the C.D.C. on Nov. 28 stated, ''Forgiveness is between them and God. It is my job to arrange a meeting,'' according to records obtained by The New York Times after the filing of an open records request.

Another e-mail message, sent to the C.D.C. on Aug. 20, said, ''I'd like to know how you people sleep straight in bed at night knowing all the lies you tell &amp; the lives you know full well you destroy with the poisons you push &amp; protect with your lies.'' Lynn Redwood of SafeMinds said that such e-mail messages did not represent her organization or other advocacy groups.

In response to the threats, C.D.C. officials have contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and heightened security at the disease control centers. Some officials said that the threats had led them to look for other jobs.

In ''Evidence of Harm,'' a book published earlier this year that is sympathetic to the notion that thimerosal causes autism, the author, David Kirby, wrote that the thimerosal theory would stand or fall within the next year or two.

Because autism is usually diagnosed sometime between a child's third and fourth birthdays and thimerosal was largely removed from childhood vaccines in 2001, the incidence of autism should fall this year, he said.

No such decline followed thimerosal's removal from vaccines during the 1990's in Denmark, Sweden or Canada, researchers say.

But the debate over autism and vaccines is not likely to end soon.

''It doesn't seem to matter what the studies and the data show,'' said Ms. Ehresmann, the Minnesota immunization official. ''And that's really scary for us because if science doesn't count, how do we make decisions? How do we communicate with parents?''

Correction:  July 20, 2005, Wednesday  A front-page article on June 25 about a debate over whether autism is caused by thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative once routinely used in vaccines, misattributed a statement that was part of an exchange in which a parent of an autistic child asked officials of the Minnesota Department of Health, ''How did my daughter get so much mercury in her?'' The final statement in the exchange, ''Well, do you breathe the air?,'' was made by Patricia Segal-Freeman of the Health Department, not her colleague Kristen Ehresmann. (When read a transcript before publication, Ms. Ehresmann confirmed that she was the speaker in the exchange; she later acknowledged that the statement was made by Ms. Segal-Freeman.)

Because of an editing error, the article also misspelled the given name of the president of SafeMinds, one of several groups that argue that there is a link between thimerosal and autism. She is Lyn Redwood, not Lynn.

	Federal Panel Hears Testimony on Vaccinations and Autism


Medical experts squared off Monday before a federal panel trying to determine whether a mercury-based preservative once common in routine childhood vaccines was behind the rising rates of autism in the United States.

Most of the epidemiologists who testified said they doubted that the preservative, thimerosal, was responsible. But a few toxicologists said they had become more and more convinced of a potential link.

Since 1999, thimerosal has been gradually removed from vaccines given to infants and toddlers in the United States, though it can still be found in flu shots and others.

While autism is increasing sharply both in the United States and abroad, scientists have been unable to pinpoint a cause. Many suggest that the rise is unlikely to have an environmental cause and can be explained by other factors like rising awareness on the part of parents, doctors and teachers.

Still, some toxicologists told the panel, convened by the Institute of Medicine, that mercury levels were higher in children with autism. They said these children might have biochemical defects that prevented them from processing the metal as efficiently as do normal children.

The idea that thimerosal might be causing autism ''has become more plausible than when your committee first discussed this,'' said Dr. H. Vasken Aposhian, a toxicologist at the University of Arizona.

Another toxicologist, Boyd Haley of the University of Kentucky, told the panel that his studies had shown that testosterone might fuel the toxic effects of mercury. Autism overwhelmingly affects boys.

Epidemiological studies, including a Danish one published last year, have shown no connection between thimerosal exposure and autism.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the American Academy of Pediatrics have said no credible scientific evidence connects thimerosal with autism or other childhood neurological disorders.

The Institute of Medicine panel is collecting data for a report to be issued in June.

At Monday's hearing, the scientists were joined by a vocal group of parents of autistic children who say their children's symptoms, including developmental delays, social inhibition and immune system defects, were caused by a toxic accumulation of mercury from vaccines for pertussis, diphtheria, hepatitis B, and measles, mumps and rubella.

Representative Dave Weldon, Republican of Florida, accused the Centers for Disease Control of ignoring potential links and said it was blocking access by outside researchers to a vaccine database it maintained with a group of managed-care organizations.

''I received numerous complaints that this event is not a further attempt to get at the facts but rather a desire to sweep these issues under the rug,'' said Mr. Weldon, an advocate for parents with autistic children.

Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the disease centers, said the agency's director, Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, had discussed the issue with Mr. Weldon and shared his commitment ''to addressing the importance of autism and vaccine safety with the best possible science and the most effective programs.''

Most of the studies presented to the panel on Monday have been published already, but the hearing gave members a chance to question researchers.

Dr. Frank DeStefano, a researcher at the disease centers, presented a study of schoolchildren in the Atlanta area who were given vaccines that contained thimerosal that found no increased risk of autism. It received widespread attention when it was published last November. But parent groups and Mr. Weldon say the preliminary conclusions of the study, which were circulated among researchers in 2000, suggest a link, and they allege that the data were changed.

Dr. DeStefano said raw data from the study would be made available to other researchers.

Two outsiders who have examined that information, Dr. Mark Geier, a physician, and his son David Geier, who have been expert witnesses for parents seeking payment from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, said they had come to the conclusion that thimerosal was causing autism. ''That database supports every other database that thimerosal is a major contributor to the autism epidemic,'' Mark Geier said.

Correction:  February 26, 2004, Thursday  An article on Feb. 10 about a federal hearing on the relationship between autism and thimerosal, a preservative once common in childhood vaccines, referred incorrectly to a study in the journal Pediatrics that some toxicologists and parent groups have interpreted as suggesting a link. It was published in November, not this month; its subjects were children in several H.M.O.'s in California and Massachusetts, not in the Atlanta area. (A second autism study, carried out in the Atlanta area, appeared in Pediatrics this month.)

	Intriguing Intricacies From the Mars Rocks


Gusev Crater and Meridiani Planum, the exploration sites for NASA's twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity, are on opposite sides of Mars and are as different as New York City and the Illinois prairie. Gusev Crater is rocks, rocks everywhere. Meridiani Planum is flat, almost featureless, almost rockless and blanketed with a fine-grained red soil and dark pebbles.

Mission scientists yesterday presented the 360-degree color panorama of the Opportunity landing site in Meridiani Planum. Because the panoramic camera actually consists of two cameras, it produces three-dimensional images. The camera also has 14 color filters, so it can view a scene from the infrared to the blue.

''It provides us with a real sense of 'You Are There' at the site,'' said Dr. Jeffrey R. Johnson, a member of the science team from the United States Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Ariz.

Before the rovers landed, many scientists expected that the Spirit would land on more interesting terrain in Gusev Crater and that the Opportunity would have to drive quite a distance to find worthy objects of study.

''It's just the opposite,'' said Dr. Ronald Greeley, a professor of geological sciences at Arizona State University who is on the science team.

That reaction may seem odd for a mission trying to unravel the geological history of Mars, specifically whether it was once warm and wet.

Gusev Crater may be an ancient lakebed. With river channels visible at its perimeter, water almost certainly flowed into the 95-mile-wide depression, at least intermittently, and the water would have carried rocks from surrounding regions.

The fun at Gusev, geologists say, will be the chance to examine a wide variety of rocks from many places.

''We see rocks there, but we don't really know where they came from,'' said Dr. Steven W. Squyres, a professor of astronomy at Cornell who is the mission's principal investigator. ''Many were probably carried there by water or lava that flowed up. It's going to be a tough puzzle to sort out.''

But Gusev, it turns out, looks like terrain at the two Viking lander sites in the 1970's and what the Mars Pathfinder encountered in 1997.

Scientists hope to head off soon to a more interesting site, a crater 800 feet away, where they hope that the depression discloses more of the geological history below the surface.

The landing site on Meridiani Planum, by comparison, looked so bland and boring from orbit that mission scientists briefly considered asking that the target be nudged to an area with a few more craters.

Now that the Opportunity has landed, scientists are wondering how long they can linger near the landing site. The surreal surroundings look like nothing else. The soil is considerably darker than the other landing sites.

''I always knew if we went to enough places on Mars we would find something that's truly different,'' Dr. Squyres said at a news conference after the landing.

By luck, the Opportunity overshot its target, ending in a shallow 72-foot-wide crater. The scientists gasped when the first photographs showed an outcrop of bedrock 25 feet away, the first piece of Martian bedrock they will be able to explore closely.

The bedrock contains fine layers, as thin as half an inch, indicating that it is sedimentary or layers of volcanic ash from eruptions.

''The beauty of bedrock is you know this is the home neighborhood of these rocks,'' Dr. Squyres said. ''That's just a tremendously valuable thing. Instead of being busted up into pieces, you've actually got these layers.''

Dr. Squyres said the layers are too thin to be lava flows.

An instrument that measures thermal emissions has identified in the dark pebbly surface an iron oxide that on Earth typically forms in the presence of water. The oxide probably gives the surface its dark color.

Even the dirt fascinates scientists. The panoramas show round bright circles where the air bags that cushioned the landing bounced. The soil even shows the imprints of the seams of the air bags.

''Hopefully,'' Dr. Johnson said, ''over the next few weeks as the rover starts to do its reconnaissance of the outcrop and sample some of the soils, we'll have a better idea of just the type of the geological history we're looking at.''

	Scientists Report Evidence Of Saltwater Pools on Mars


Mars was once a much warmer, wetter place, with pools of saltwater that sometimes flowed across the surface, scientists reported Tuesday.

Analyzing findings from sedimentary rocks explored by the rover Opportunity, the scientists said the rocks now appeared to have formed under a shallow bed of softly flowing water near a shoreline -- not, as formerly seemed possible, through seepage from underground.

It was the first concrete evidence that water might have flowed on the Martian surface, and it provided new hints that life may have existed there.

''We think Opportunity is now parked on what was once the shoreline of a salty sea on Mars,'' Dr. Steven W. Squyres of Cornell University, principal investigator for the science payload on the Opportunity and its twin Mars exploration rover, Spirit, said at a news conference here at NASA headquarters.

''If we are correct in our interpretation, this was a habitable environment,'' Dr. Squyres went on. ''It's a salt flat. These are the kinds of environments that are very suitable for life.''

He said there was still no evidence that life existed at the site, and the Opportunity does not have the instruments to hunt for microscopic fossils. But rock formed from sediments from evaporating standing water, like those at the site, ''offers excellent capability for preserving evidence of any biochemical or biological material that may have been in the water,'' he said.

The rover Opportunity landed on a plain called Meridiani Planum on Jan. 25, three weeks after the Spirit touched down on the opposite side of the planet at a site called Gusev Crater. NASA officials said Tuesday that the two craft were operating so well that their original 90-day missions would very likely extend into the summer.

Dr. Edward Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space science, said that when researchers first announced on March 2 that the Opportunity had found rocks that formed in the presence of water, there was some indication that the water pooled on the surface. But to be sure that they were interpreting the data correctly, Dr. Weiler said, they sent it to several outside experts for review before Tuesday's announcement.

One of those scientists, Dr. David Rubin, a sedimentary expert with the United States Geological Survey in Santa Cruz, Calif., said he was shocked when he received the Mars pictures from NASA. ''I was astonished,'' Dr. Rubin said. ''They looked like sedimentary deposits found at a beach on Earth.''

Dr. Rubin told the news conference that some of the pictures showed rocks that could have been formed by particles deposited by the wind, and others by sediments put down by water. However, he said, there are features in some of the formations that require flowing water, which supports the explanations by the rover scientists.

Dr. John Grotzinger of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a member of the rover science team, said the rocky outcroppings examined by the Opportunity have ripple patterns and salt concentrations that are telltale signs of rock formed in standing water that sometimes flowed. This would be like some salt flats on Earth, which are periodically submerged, Dr. Grotzinger said.

To examine the patterns in the Mars outcroppings, the Opportunity used a microscopic camera on its robot arm to take multiple postage-stamp-sized pictures that were put together into mosaics to examine the layering in the rock.

The close-up pictures revealed that the sediments that bonded to form the rocks were in uneven layers distorted by the ripples of flowing water, patterns called crossbedding and festooning, Dr. Grotzinger said.

Patterns in some of the layered rocks indicate they were shaped by ripples at least two inches deep, and possibly much deeper, flowing at a speed of 4 to 20 inches per second, he said.

The patterns include distinctive, upward-turning curves characteristic of water depositing particles in layers rather than wind, he said.

In further evidence of water formation, Dr. Grotzinger said, the rover found chlorine and bromine salts in the rocks, suggesting that salt concentrations were rising while water was evaporating.

Dr. Weiler said the findings would spur efforts to expand Mars exploration and look for evidence of past or current life. He noted that NASA planned to send the Mars Science Laboratory, a more sophisticated rover that will do detailed life-science testing, to the planet in 2009 and that Meridiani was now a prime site.

To search for further evidence of Martian water, the Opportunity has climbed out of its landing site and will head for a crater named Endurance, 2,300 feet away. That crater, scientists said, may have even deeper rock formations.

	Facing Life With a Lethal Gene


The test, the counselor said, had come back positive.

Katharine Moser inhaled sharply. She thought she was as ready as anyone could be to face her genetic destiny. She had attended a genetic counseling session and visited a psychiatrist, as required by the clinic. She had undergone the recommended neurological exam. And yet, she realized in that moment, she had never expected to hear those words.

''What do I do now?'' Ms. Moser asked.

''What do you want to do?'' the counselor replied.

''Cry,'' she said quietly.

Her best friend, Colleen Elio, seated next to her, had already begun.

Ms. Moser was 23. It had taken her months to convince the clinic at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center in Manhattan that she wanted, at such a young age, to find out whether she carried the gene for Huntington's disease.

Huntington's, the incurable brain disorder that possessed her grandfather's body and ravaged his mind for three decades, typically strikes in middle age. But most young adults who know the disease runs in their family have avoided the DNA test that can tell whether they will get it, preferring the torture -- and hope -- of not knowing.

Ms. Moser is part of a vanguard of people at risk for Huntington's who are choosing to learn early what their future holds. Facing their genetic heritage, they say, will help them decide how to live their lives.

Yet even as a raft of new DNA tests are revealing predispositions to all kinds of conditions, including breast cancer, depression and dementia, little is known about what it is like to live with such knowledge.

''What runs in your own family, and would you want to know?'' said Nancy Wexler, a neuropsychologist at Columbia and the president of the Hereditary Disease Foundation, which has pioneered Huntington's research. ''Soon everyone is going to have an option like this. You make the decision to test, you have to live with the consequences.''

On that drizzly spring morning two years ago, Ms. Moser was feeling her way, with perhaps the most definitive and disturbing verdict genetic testing has to offer. Anyone who carries the gene will inevitably develop Huntington's.

She fought her tears. She tried for humor.

Don't let yourself get too thin, said the clinic's social worker. Not a problem, Ms. Moser responded, gesturing to her curvy frame. No more than two drinks at a time. Perhaps, Ms. Moser suggested to Ms. Elio, she meant one in each hand.

Then came anger.

''Why me?'' she remembers thinking, in a refrain she found hard to shake in the coming months. ''I'm the good one. It's not like I'm sick because I have emphysema from smoking or I did something dangerous.''

The gene that will kill Ms. Moser sits on the short arm of everyone's fourth chromosome, where the letters of the genetic alphabet normally repeat C-A-G as many as 35 times in a row. In people who develop Huntington's, however, there are more than 35 repeats.

No one quite knows why this DNA hiccup causes cell death in the brain, leading Huntington's patients to jerk and twitch uncontrollably and rendering them progressively unable to walk, talk, think and swallow. But the greater the number of repeats, the earlier symptoms tend to appear and the faster they progress.

Ms. Moser's ''CAG number'' was 45, the counselor said. She had more repeats than her grandfather, whose first symptoms -- loss of short-term memory, mood swings and a constant ticking noise he made with his mouth -- surfaced when he turned 50. But it was another year before Ms. Moser would realize that she could have less than 12 years until she showed symptoms.

Immediately after getting her results, Ms. Moser was too busy making plans.

''I'm going to become super-strong and super-balanced,'' she vowed over lunch with Ms. Elio, her straight brown hair pulled into a determined bun. ''So when I start to lose it I'll be a little closer to normal.''

In the tumultuous months that followed, Ms. Moser often found herself unable to remember what normal had once been. She forced herself to renounce the crush she had long nursed on a certain firefighter, sure that marriage was no longer an option for her. She threw herself into fund-raising in the hopes that someone would find a cure. Sometimes, she raged.

She never, she said, regretted being tested. But at night, crying herself to sleep in the dark of her lavender bedroom, she would go over and over it. She was the same, but she was also different. And there was nothing she could do.

A Lesson in Stigma

Ms. Moser grew up in Connecticut, part of a large Irish Catholic family. Like many families affected by Huntington's, Ms. Moser's regarded the disease as a curse, not to be mentioned even as it dominated their lives in the form of her grandfather's writhing body and unpredictable rages.

Once, staying in Ms. Moser's room on a visit, he broke her trundle bed with his violent, involuntary jerking. Another time, he came into the kitchen naked, his underpants on his head. When the children giggled, Ms. Moser's mother defended her father: ''If you don't like it, get out of my house and go.''

But no one explained what had happened to their grandfather, Thomas Dowd, a former New York City police officer who once had dreams of retiring to Florida.

In 1990, Mr. Dowd's older brother, living in a veteran's hospital in an advanced stage of the disease, was strangled in his own restraints. But a year or so later, when Ms. Moser wanted to do her sixth-grade science project on Huntington's, her mother recoiled.

''Why,'' she demanded, ''would you want to do it on this disease that is killing your grandfather?''

Ms. Moser was left to confirm for herself, through library books and a CD-ROM encyclopedia, that she and her brothers, her mother, her aunts, an uncle and cousins could all face the same fate.

Any child who has a parent with Huntington's has a 50 percent chance of having inherited the gene that causes it, Ms. Moser learned.

Her mother, who asked not to be identified by name for fear of discrimination, had not always been so guarded. At one point, she drove around with a ''Cure HD'' sign in the window of her van. She told people that her father had ''Woody Guthrie's disease,'' invoking the folk icon who died of Huntington's in 1967.

But her efforts to raise awareness soon foundered. Huntington's is a rare genetic disease, affecting about 30,000 people in the United States, with about 250,000 more at risk. Few people know what it is. Strangers assumed her father's unsteady walk, a frequent early symptom, meant he was drunk.

''Nobody has compassion,'' Ms. Moser's mother concluded. ''People look at you like you're strange, and 'What's wrong with you?' ''

Shortly after a simple DNA test became available for Huntington's in 1993, one of Ms. Moser's aunts tested positive. Another, driven to find out if her own medical problems were related to Huntington's, tested negative. But when Ms. Moser announced as a teenager that she wanted to get tested one day, her mother insisted that she should not. If her daughter carried the gene, that meant she did, too. And she did not want to know.

''You don't want to know stuff like that,'' Ms. Moser's mother said in an interview. ''You want to enjoy life.''

Ms. Moser's father, who met and married his wife six years before Ms. Moser's grandfather received his Huntington's diagnosis, said he had managed not to think much about her at-risk status.

''So she was at risk,'' he said. ''Everyone's at risk for everything.''

The test, Ms. Moser remembers her mother suggesting, would cost thousands of dollars. Still, in college, Ms. Moser often trolled the Web for information about it. Mostly, she imagined how sweet it would be to know she did not have the gene. But increasingly she was haunted, too, by the suspicion that her mother did.

As awful as it was, she admitted to Ms. Elio, her freshman-year neighbor at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania, she almost hoped it was true. It would explain her mother's strokes of meanness, her unpredictable flashes of anger.

Ms. Moser's mother said she had never considered the conflicts with her daughter out of the ordinary. ''All my friends who had daughters said that was all normal, and when she's 25 she'll be your best friend,'' she said. ''I was waiting for that to happen, but I guess it's not happening.''

When Ms. Moser graduated in 2003 with a degree in occupational therapy, their relationship, never peaceful, was getting worse. She moved to Queens without giving her mother her new address.

Wanting to Know

Out of school, Ms. Moser soon spotted a listing for a job at Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center, a nursing home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She knew it was meant for her.

Her grandfather had died there in 2002 after living for a decade at the home, one of only a handful in the country with a unit devoted entirely to Huntington's.

''I hated visiting him growing up,'' Ms. Moser said. ''It was scary.''

Now, though, she was drawn to see the disease up close.

On breaks from her duties elsewhere, she visited her cousin James Dowd, the son of her grandfather's brother who had come to live in the Huntington's unit several years earlier. It was there, in a conversation with another staff member, that she learned she could be tested for only a few hundred dollars at the Columbia clinic across town. She scheduled an appointment for the next week.

The staff at Columbia urged Ms. Moser to consider the downside of genetic testing. Some people battle depression after they test positive. And the information, she was cautioned, could make it harder for her to get a job or health insurance.

But Ms. Moser bristled at the idea that she should have to remain ignorant about her genetic status to avoid discrimination. ''I didn't do anything wrong,'' she said. ''It's not like telling people I'm a drug addict.''

She also recalls rejecting a counselor's suggestion that she might have asked to be tested as a way of crying for help.

''I'm like, 'No,' '' Ms. Moser recalls replying. '' 'I've come to be tested because I want to know.' ''

No one routinely collects demographic information about who gets tested for Huntington's. At the Huntington's Disease Center at Columbia, staff members say they have seen few young people taking the test.

Ms. Moser is still part of a distinct minority. But some researchers say her attitude is increasingly common among young people who know they may develop Huntington's.

More informed about the genetics of the disease than any previous generation, they are convinced that they would rather know how many healthy years they have left than wake up one day to find the illness upon them. They are confident that new reproductive technologies can allow them to have children without transmitting the disease and are eager to be first in line should a treatment become available.

''We're seeing a shift,'' said Dr. Michael Hayden, a professor of human genetics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who has been providing various tests for Huntington's for 20 years. ''Younger people are coming for testing now, people in their 20s and early 30s; before, that was very rare. I've counseled some of them. They feel it is part of their heritage and that it is possible to lead a life that's not defined by this gene.''

Before the test, Ms. Moser made two lists of life goals. Under ''if negative,'' she wrote married, children and Ireland. Under ''if positive'' was exercise, vitamins and ballroom dancing. Balance, in that case, would be important. Opening a bed-and-breakfast, a goal since childhood, made both lists.

In the weeks before getting the test results, Ms. Moser gave Ms. Elio explicit instructions about acceptable responses. If she was negative, flowers were O.K. If positive, they were not. In either case, drinking was acceptable. Crying was not.

But it was Ms. Elio's husband, Chris Elio, who first broached the subject of taking care of Ms. Moser, whom their young children called ''my Katie,'' as in ''this is my mom, this is my dad, this is my Katie.'' They should address it before the results were in, Mr. Elio told his wife, so that she would not feel, later, that they had done it out of a sense of obligation.

The next day, in an e-mail note that was unusually formal for friends who sent text messages constantly and watched ''Desperate Housewives'' while on the phone together, Ms. Elio told Ms. Moser that she and her husband wanted her to move in with them if she got sick. Ms. Moser set the note aside. She did not expect to need it.

'It's Too Hard to Look'

The results had come a week early, and Ms. Moser assured her friends that the ''Sex and the City'' trivia party she had planned for that night was still on. After all, she was not sick, not dying. And she had already made the dips.

''I'm the same person I've always been,'' she insisted that night as her guests gamely dipped strawberries in her chocolate fountain. ''It's been in me from the beginning.''

But when she went to work the next day, she lingered outside the door of the occupational therapy gym, not wanting to face her colleagues. She avoided the Huntington's floor entirely, choosing to attend to patients ailing of just about anything else. ''It's too hard to look at them,'' she told her friends.

In those first months, Ms. Moser summoned all her strength to pretend that nothing cataclysmic had happened. At times, it seemed easy enough. In the mirror, the same green eyes looked back at her. She was still tall, a devoted Julia Roberts fan, a prolific baker.

She dropped the news of her genetic status into some conversations like small talk, but kept it from her family. She made light of her newfound fate, though often friends were not sure how to take the jokes.

''That's my Huntington's kicking in,'' she told Rachel Markan, a co-worker, after knocking a patient's folder on the floor.

Other times, Ms. Moser abruptly dropped any pretense of routine banter. On a trip to Florida, she and Ms. Elio saw a man in a wheelchair being tube-fed, a method often used to keep Huntington's patients alive for years after they can no longer swallow.

''I don't want a feeding tube,'' she announced flatly.

In those early days, she calculated that she had at least until 50 before symptoms set in. That was enough time to open a bed-and-breakfast, if she acted fast. Enough time to repay $70,000 in student loans under her 30-year term.

Doing the math on the loans, though, could send her into a tailspin.

''I'll be repaying them and then I'll start getting sick,'' she said. ''I mean, there's no time in there.''

Finding New Purpose

At the end of the summer, as the weather grew colder, Ms. Moser forced herself to return to the Huntington's unit.

In each patient, she saw her future: the biophysicist slumped in his wheelchair, the refrigerator repairman inert in his bed, the onetime professional tennis player who floated through the common room, arms undulating in the startlingly graceful movements that had earned the disease its original name, ''Huntington's chorea,'' from the Greek ''to dance.''

Then there was her cousin Jimmy, who had wrapped papers for The New York Post for 19 years until suddenly he could no longer tie the knots. When she greeted him, his bright blue eyes darted to her face, then away. If he knew her, it was impossible to tell.

She did what she could for them. She customized their wheelchairs with padding to fit each one's unique tics. She doled out special silverware, oversized or bent in just the right angles to prolong their ability to feed themselves.

Fending off despair, Ms. Moser was also filled with new purpose. Someone, somewhere, she told friends, had to find a cure.

It has been over a century since the disease was identified by George Huntington, a doctor in Amagansett, N.Y., and over a decade since researchers first found the gene responsible for it.

To raise money for research, Ms. Moser volunteered for walks and dinners and golf outings sponsored by the Huntington's Disease Society of America. She organized a Hula-Hoop-a-thon on the roof of Cardinal Cooke, then a bowl-a-thon at the Port Authority. But at many of the events, attendance was sparse.

It is hard to get people to turn out for Huntington's benefits, she learned from the society's professional fund-raisers. Even families affected by the disease, the most obvious constituents, often will not help publicize events.

''They don't want people to know they're connected to Huntington's,'' Ms. Moser said, with a mix of anger and recognition. ''It's like in my family -- it's not a good thing.''

Her first session with a therapist brought a chilling glimpse of how the disorder is viewed even by some who know plenty about it. ''She told me it was my moral and ethical obligation not to have children,'' Ms. Moser told Ms. Elio by cellphone as soon as she left the office, her voice breaking.

In lulls between fund-raisers, Ms. Moser raced to educate her own world about Huntington's. She added links about the disease to her MySpace page. She plastered her desk at work with ''Cure HD'' stickers and starred in a video about the Huntington's unit for her union's Web site.

Ms. Moser gave blood for one study and spoke into a microphone for researchers trying to detect subtle speech differences in people who have extra CAG repeats before more noticeable disease symptoms emerge.

When researchers found a way to cure mice bred to replicate features of the disease in humans, Ms. Moser sent the news to friends and acquaintances.

But it was hard to celebrate. ''Thank God,'' the joke went around on the Huntington's National Youth Alliance e-mail list Ms. Moser subscribed to, ''at least there won't be any more poor mice wandering around with Huntington's disease.''

In October, one of Ms. Moser's aunts lost her balance while walking and broke her nose. It was the latest in a series of falls. ''The cure needs to be soon for me,'' Ms. Moser said. ''Sooner for everybody else.''

A Confrontation in Court

In the waiting room of the Dutchess County family courthouse on a crisp morning in the fall of 2005, Ms. Moser approached her mother, who turned away.

''I need to tell her something important,'' Ms. Moser told a family member who had accompanied her mother to the hearing.

He conveyed the message and brought one in return: Unless she was dying, her mother did not have anything to say to her.

That Ms. Moser had tested positive meant that her mother would develop Huntington's, if she had not already. A year earlier, Ms. Moser's mother had convinced a judge that her sister, Nora Maldonado, was neglecting her daughter. She was given guardianship of the daughter, 4-year-old Jillian.

Ms. Moser had been skeptical of her mother's accusations that Ms. Maldonado was not feeding or bathing Jillian properly, and she wondered whether her effort to claim Jillian had been induced by the psychological symptoms of the disease.

Her testimony about her mother's genetic status, Ms. Moser knew, could help persuade the judge to return Jillian. Ms. Maldonado had found out years earlier that she did not have the Huntington's gene.

Ms. Moser did not believe that someone in the early stages of Huntington's should automatically be disqualified from taking care of a child. But her own rocky childhood had convinced her that Jillian would be better off with Ms. Maldonado.

She told her aunt's lawyer about her test results and agreed to testify.

In the courtroom, Ms. Moser took the witness stand. Her mother's lawyer jumped up as soon as the topic of Huntington's arose. It was irrelevant, he said. But by the time the judge had sustained his objections, Ms. Moser's mother, stricken, had understood.

The next day, in the bathroom, Ms. Maldonado approached Ms. Moser's mother.

''I'm sorry,'' she said. Ms. Moser's mother said nothing.

The court has continued to let Ms. Moser's mother retain guardianship of Jillian. But she has not spoken to her daughter again.

''It's a horrible illness,'' Ms. Moser's mother said, months later, gesturing to her husband. ''Now he has a wife who has it. Did she think of him? Did she think of me? Who's going to marry her?''

Facing the Future

Before the test, it was as if Ms. Moser had been balanced between parallel universes, one in which she would never get the disease and one in which she would. The test had made her whole.

She began to prepare the Elio children and Jillian for her illness, determined that they would not be scared, as she had been with her grandfather. When Jillian wanted to know how people got Huntington's disease ''in their pants,'' Ms. Moser wrote the text of a children's book that explained what these other kinds of ''genes'' were and why they would make her sick.

But over the winter, Ms. Elio complained gently that her friend had become ''Ms. H.D.'' And an impromptu note that arrived for the children in the early spring convinced her that Ms. Moser was dwelling too much on her own death.

''You all make me so happy, and I am so proud of who you are and who you will be,'' read the note, on rainbow scratch-and-write paper. ''I will always remember the fun things we do together.''

Taking matters into her own hands, Ms. Elio created a profile for Ms. Moser on an online dating service. Ms. Moser was skeptical but supplied a picture. Dating, she said, was the worst thing about knowing she had the Huntington's gene. It was hard to imagine someone falling enough in love with her to take on Huntington's knowingly, or asking it of someone she loved. At the same time, she said, knowing her status could help her find the right person, if he was out there.

''Either way, I was going to get sick,'' she said. ''And I'd want someone who could handle it. If, by some twist of fate, I do get married and have children, at least we know what we're getting into.''

After much debate, the friends settled on the third date as the right time to mention Huntington's. But when the first date came, Ms. Moser wished she could just blurt it out.

''It kind of just lingers there,'' she said. ''I really just want to be able to tell people, 'Someday, I'm going to have Huntington's disease.' ''

'A Part of My Life'

Last May 6, a year to the day after she had received her test results, the subject line ''CAG Count'' caught Ms. Moser's attention as she was scrolling through the online discussion forums of the Huntington's Disease Advocacy Center. She knew she had 45 CAG repeats, but she had never investigated it further.

She clicked on the message.

''My mother's CAG was 43,'' it read. ''She started forgetting the punch line to jokes at 39/40.'' Another woman whose husband's CAG count was 47 had just sold his car. ''He's 39 years old,'' she wrote. ''It was time for him to quit driving.''

Quickly, Ms. Moser scanned a chart that accompanied the messages for her number, 45. The median age of onset to which it corresponded was 37.

Ms. Elio got drunk with her husbandthe night Ms. Moser finally told her.

''That's 12 years away,'' Ms. Moser said.

The statistic, they knew, meant that half of those with her CAG number started showing symptoms after age 37. But it also meant that the other half started showing symptoms earlier.

Ms. Moser, meanwhile, flew to the annual convention of the Huntington's Disease Society, which she had decided at the last minute to attend.

''Mother or father?'' one woman, 23, from Chicago, asked a few minutes after meeting Ms. Moser in the elevator of the Milwaukee Hilton. ''Have you tested? What's your CAG?''

She was close to getting herself tested, the woman confided. How did it feel to know?

''It's hard to think the other way anymore of not knowing,'' Ms. Moser replied. ''It's become a part of my life.''

After years of trying to wring conversation from her family about Huntington's, Ms. Moser suddenly found herself bathing in it. But for the first time in a long time, her mind was on other things. At a youth support group meeting in the hotel hallway, she took her place in the misshapen circle. Later, on the dance floor, the spasms of the symptomatic seemed as natural as the gyrations of the normal.

''I'm not alone in this,'' Ms. Moser remembers thinking. ''This affects other people, too, and we all just have to live our lives.''

Seizing the Day

July 15, the day of Ms. Moser's 25th birthday party, was sunny, with a hint of moisture in the air. At her aunt's house in Long Beach, N.Y., Ms. Moser wore a dress with pictures of cocktails on it. It was, she and Ms. Elio told anyone who would listen, her ''cocktail dress.'' They drew the quotation marks in the air.

A bowl of ''Cure HD'' pins sat on the table. Over burgers from the barbecue, Ms. Moser mentioned to family members from her father's side that she had tested positive for the Huntington's gene.

''What's that?'' one cousin asked.

''It will affect my ability to walk, talk and think,'' Ms. Moser said. ''Sometime before I'm 50.''

''That's soon,'' an uncle said matter-of-factly.

''So do you have to take medication?'' her cousin asked.

''There's nothing really to take,'' Ms. Moser said.

She and the Elios put on bathing suits, loaded the children in a wagon and walked to the beach.

More than anything now, Ms. Moser said, she is filled with a sense of urgency.

''I have a lot to do,'' she said. ''And I don't have a lot of time.''

Over the next months, Ms. Moser took tennis lessons every Sunday morning and went to church in the evening.

When a planned vacation with the Elio family fell through at the last minute, she went anyway, packing Disney World, Universal Studios, Wet 'n Wild and Sea World into 36 hours with a high school friend who lives in Orlando. She was honored at a dinner by the New York chapter of the Huntington's society for her outreach efforts and managed a brief thank-you speech despite her discomfort with public speaking.

Having made a New Year's resolution to learn to ride a unicycle, she bought a used one. ''My legs are tired, my arms are tired, and I definitely need protection,'' she reported to Ms. Elio. On Super Bowl Sunday, she waded into the freezing Atlantic Ocean for a Polar Bear swim to raise money for the Make-a-Wish Foundation.

Ms. Elio complained that she hardly got to see her friend. But one recent weekend, they packed up the Elio children and drove to the house the Elios were renovating in eastern Pennsylvania. The kitchen floor needed grouting, and, rejecting the home improvement gospel that calls for a special tool designed for the purpose, Ms. Moser and Ms. Elio had decided to use pastry bags.

As they turned into the driveway, Ms. Moser studied the semi-attached house next door. Maybe she would move in one day, as the Elios had proposed. Then, when she could no longer care for herself, they could put in a door.

First, though, she wanted to travel. She had heard of a job that would place her in different occupational therapy positions across the country every few months and was planning to apply.

''I'm thinking Hawaii first,'' she said.

Then they donned gloves, mixed grout in a large bucket of water and began the job.

	Boom in Gene Testing Raises Questions on Sharing Results


As genetic testing becomes increasingly common, those who choose to learn their genetic risks, and the health professionals who treat them, are facing difficult decisions about how -- and whether -- to share the results with family members who share their genes.

And the new genetic information is creating new kinds of rifts, when one family member finds out what another family member does not want to know, or when family members react differently to the same knowledge.

''One woman who'd had ovarian cancer was tested for the breast cancer gene mutations mostly for the sake of her two adult daughters,'' said Katherine Schneider, senior genetics counselor at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ''But when she told them she had it, they were so devastated that they didn't talk with her for two years. They didn't want to know.

''I tell that story a lot. There's nothing easy about any of this. But before testing, it's important to talk not only about what the information will mean for you, but what it might mean to your sisters, your children, your cousins.''

Genetic tests are now commonplace, what with prenatal tests diagnosing hundreds of syndromes, midlife tests for mutations linked to breast and ovarian cancer, and -- with the human genome newly mapped -- more and more familial disorders.

The scientific advances have created debate about public policy on genetic discrimination. But the private effects on family dynamics are just as complex, as patients and health professionals adjust to thinking about family not just as flesh and blood, but flesh and blood and genes.

Usually, patients are happy to share health information with family members for whom it may be important, often asking the doctor or genetic counselor for a written explanation to pass along.

But when patients want to keep the information to themselves, health professionals may encounter situations that mix social problem and soap opera, and be  ethically and legally pulled into uncharted waters.

A young man in Washington State called his genetics counselor to confess a guilty conscience: Several months earlier, he told her, he had made a sperm donation. And while he knew his test results had shown that he had an inheritable syndrome that causes heart trouble and, often, early death, he did not mention it to the sperm bank. Troubled, the counselor called the sperm bank and found that there had, indeed, been successful pregnancies with the man's sperm. She offered to counsel those families but does not know whether the sperm bank even passed on the information.

In a New York family with three adult daughters, the two married daughters know that their mother, who had breast cancer as a young woman, has been tested and found to carry a gene mutation associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The mother has forbidden them to tell their unmarried sister, who has always felt herself to be the least attractive, for fear that it might make her less marriageable. They have obeyed, but want the family doctor  to make sure she has frequent mammograms and screenings.

Two sisters who know their mother had genetic testing before she died of ovarian cancer want to find out her test results. But the Pennsylvania medical center that did the testing will not release the results to the young women without the consent of their stepfather, who has a dismal relationship with them. The sisters could, of course, have had their own genetic tests, but they had hoped by learning more about their family's history to avoid the process. The center's ethics committee is now revising its consent forms to require all patients tested to specify which family members should have access to the results after their death.

One California genetics counselor tells of her confusion when a couple who had a child with cystic fibrosis came to discuss their risks for future pregnancies, and in providing a family history, the wife mentioned that her estranged half-sister had a baby who died from a serious congenital defect. It was nothing genetic, she assured the counselor. But the counselor knew otherwise: The sister had been an earlier client.

''It just rang a bell in my head,'' the counselor said. ''I remembered the name, and I remembered telling her it was genetic, and she should tell her relatives. I didn't know what to do. But I didn't want to breach confidentiality for either one of them.''

Eventually, she called the previous client on the pretext of a routine records check. ''I played dumb, saying I just happened to have her file on my desk,'' the counselor said, ''and I'd noticed we'd talked about telling her family the results, and I was just following up for the records, wondering if that conversation had taken place, and she said, why, no, it hadn't.

''So I reminded her why it was important. And a few days later, I had a call from the current client, who said the funniest thing had happened, she'd had a call from her half-sister, and there was a genetic problem.''

Often, the decision to pass on information is a delicate one, depending not only on such factors as the relatives' closeness, ages and emotional health, but also the nature of the disease and the severity of the risk.  Where there is no treatment, or the risk is small, the case for sharing painful knowledge becomes less compelling. And the need to share information may be temporary, experts say, as the era approaches when complete genetic profiles become a routine part of individual health records. Meanwhile, the cost of testing even a single gene can run from several hundred to several thousand dollars.

Still, Josephine Wagner Costalas, a genetic counselor at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, has an unspoken worry whenever she counsels a patient who has tested positive for the breast cancer gene mutations.

''My worst nightmare is the scenario where I might have a patient who tests positive and doesn't tell her relatives,'' Ms. Costalas said, ''and a few years later her sister will discover she has metastatic cancer, with a bad prognosis, and she'll find out that there was this information showing she was at risk. And maybe she'll sue me, saying I should have picked up the phone and told her, 'Your sister's positive, you should get tested.' This is all so new, and there are no clear guidelines, so I worry.''

Still, Ms. Costalas does not pressure her patients to share their results. ''If people aren't sure about sharing the information, I ask them to think about what it would be like if the situation were reversed,'' she said. ''Would they want to know? But I do believe patients need to decide for themselves what they want to do.''

And when several family members come in together, there are other issues. ''What if they have different results?'' Ms. Costalas said. ''Who do you tell first? What if they have different reactions?''

Andrea Shumsky, whom Ms. Costalas counseled recently, never had any doubt about sharing her results. There has been a lot of cancer in Ms. Shumsky's family: Her father had early-onset colon cancer, his sister had breast cancer, three of his other siblings had colon cancer, and her grandfather had melanoma. Ms. Shumsky herself learned she had melanoma last year, on her 40th birthday, and the breast cancer gene mutations she was being tested for carry a higher risk of melanoma.

She listened as Ms. Costalas told her that the test was negative, that there was no sign that the melanoma was genetic, but that it might be worth pursuing further genetic testing for colon cancer. Then Ms. Costalas asked about Ms. Shumsky's plans to share her results.

''My sister knows I'm here, and I'm going to tell her the results as soon as I get home,'' Ms. Shumsky said. ''And I'm going to tell her about the colon cancer. After walking around with a mole for years, and then finding out it was melanoma, I want everyone in my family to watch out for cancer.

''After I got my diagnosis, I called her doctor myself, and told him she needed melanoma screening. I know it's butting into her life, but if she never talks to me again, and I save her life, it's worth the risk.''

Two years ago, the American Society of Human Genetics adopted a position recognizing the conflict between the health professions' duty to maintain confidentiality and the duty to warn about serious health risks. Health professionals should tell patients about potential genetic risks to their relatives, the statement said, and in some cases, they may be allowed to breach confidentiality to warn relatives at risk if the harm is ''serious, imminent and likely'' and prevention or treatment is available.

But there is little consensus on where to draw those lines. Generally, genetic counselors are more concerned about confidentiality and not pressuring patients, while physicians specializing in genetics are more concerned about the duty to warn, according to research by Dorothy C. Wertz, senior scientist at the Shriver Center in Waltham, Mass. As a practical matter, though, most health professionals cannot warn relatives.

''In the end it's up to the patient, because in real life, we don't have relatives' names and phone numbers,'' said Helen Hixon, a genetic counselor in cardiology at Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles. ''We do tell people pretty strongly that they  should warn their relatives, that they may have a legal duty to do so.''

Bioethics lawyers say that while patients may have some moral obligation, they have no legal duty to warn relatives. There have been at least two legal rulings, one in a 1995 Florida case and the other in a 1996 New Jersey case, giving conflicting signals on whether doctors can be held liable for not warning a patient's relatives about their risks of a hereditary form of cancer.

Although the tensions involving  family disclosure of genetic risks are not new, the issue has become more complicated as genetic tests proliferate, and it becomes possible to identify a person's predisposition to common diseases.

''It used to be that most of these issues came up around rare disorders, where there was a recessive gene that became a problem only when it met up with another carrier,'' said Vivian Weinblatt, president elect of the National Society of Genetic Counselors. ''Now we're talking about areas where it's all gray, where it's a gene that predisposes you to some disease you might get anyway in late middle age.''

The breast cancer gene mutations are the latest case in point and the fastest growing area of testing. While most cases of breast and ovarian cancer are not hereditary, women with specific mutations in the BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genes have a lifetime risk of breast or ovarian cancer over 50 percent, odds so high that many women who test positive choose to have their breasts and ovaries removed.

''My mother died of breast cancer when I was 15, and my older sister got it when she was 41,'' said a 43-year old New York woman who had the preventive surgery but told only three people. ''I knew as soon as I tested positive that I would do anything I could to get my odds down. But it's been awkward with my sister, who's against prophylactic surgery. I think she's crazy, she thinks I'm crazy and we don't talk about it anymore. Instead of it being a shared family thing, it's made us less close.''

In some families, particularly Ashkenazi Jewish families, which are more likely to carry the mutations, the testing is a pressure point.

''In one of our early research families, with a serious history of cancer, there was a push from the family matriarch that anyone found to have the mutation should get a mastectomy,'' said Jill Stopfer at the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center. ''The push was so strong that some of the younger women decided they wouldn't get tested, not because they couldn't handle the results, but because they were worried about the family pressure to have surgery.''

	It's Man vs. Pest at the Academy, and the Winner Is


Robert M. Corrigan is one of the nation's foremost experts in rodent control, but it is a different species that riles him up the most.

''Are we very smart?'' he asked his students last month, suggesting that a creature known as Homo sapiens, roughly translated to ''wise man,'' should know better. ''We want the rats to go away, but we keep trash under our desks. We want the city to kill the rats, but we throw McDonald's bags out the car window.''

The students are 70 city and state officials from a broad array of agencies: Sanitation, Parks and Recreation, Housing, Preservation and Development and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. They are taking part in a three-day Rodent Control Academy, which Dr. Corrigan has taught periodically for the last year.

The classes, financed by a federal grant, are perhaps the most visible sign that the city is rethinking its strategy on controlling rats and mice. Dr. Corrigan is a leading proponent of the shift away from extermination and poisons to a new preventative approach called integrated pest management.

A balding, energetic man of 56 whose accent reflects his childhood in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, he said he had a lifelong curiosity about creatures that generally repel. ''I always was interested in insects, rodents, creepy-crawlies that most people find disgusting,'' he said.

For several years in the 1970s, he worked for an extermination company in Manhattan, inspecting restaurants for the city and killing mice and rats for scores of private customers. His love of science led him to Purdue University, where he earned three degrees, including a doctorate in vertebrate pest management. Now he runs a consulting company in Richmond, Ind.

The academy covers everything from the role of rodents in exacerbating allergenic diseases to the proper ways to bait a rat burrow. The lessons are bolstered by dozens of handouts, a field trip and a final exam.

Rats love rotting trash, but they also feed on other creatures -- insects, fish, pigeons and even other rats -- as well as cat food and undigested matter in dog feces. A rat can crawl through a hole as small as half an inch, the diameter of its skull. Rats thrive in burrows, holes in walls, subway tunnels, sewers, empty lots and alleys.

Controlling them requires everything from proper use of garbage bins by restaurants to the right choice of landscaping by managers of apartment buildings. (Dr. Corrigan recommends vase-shaped shrubs rather than dense evergreens, like yew bushes, which cover hiding places on the ground.)

Dr. Corrigan loves dispelling myths like these: there is one rat per person (the number is impossible to estimate); rats grow to the size of adult cats (rats can be up to 18 inches long, from nose to tail); rats live long lives (typical lifespan: five to nine months); and poison is a panacea.

On the last point, Dr. Corrigan returns to his core message again, that humans create the habitats that allow rats to flourish. Poison alone will not work. It takes methodical, coordinated and sustained efforts to control rats.

''This is a big, long, complex problem for which there is no easy, quick solution,'' he said.

	'Oddball Rodent' Found (in Plain View) Is Called New to Science


They live in the forests and limestone outcrops of Laos. With long whiskers, stubby legs and a long, furry tail, they are rodents but unlike any seen before by wildlife scientists. They are definitely not rats or squirrels, and are only vaguely like a guinea pig or a chinchilla. And they often show up in Laotian outdoor markets being sold as food.

It was in such markets that visiting scientists came upon the animals, and after long study, determined that they represented a rare find: an entire new family of wildlife. The discovery was announced yesterday by the Wildlife Conservation Society and described in a report in the journal Systematics and Biodiversity.

The new species in this previously unknown family is called kha-nyou (pronounced ga-nyou) by local people. Scientists found that differences in the skull and bone structure and in the animal's DNA revealed it to be a member of a distinct family that diverged from others of the rodent order millions of years ago. ''To find something so distinct in this day and age is just extraordinary,'' said Dr. Robert J. Timmins of the Wildlife Conservation Society, one of the discoverers. ''For all we know, this could be the last remaining mammal family left to be discovered.''

Naturalists had trouble recalling when a new family of mammals was last identified. It may have been when, in the 1970's, a new family of bats was found in Thailand.

Dr. Timmins, who is based in Madison, Wis., but concentrates on research in Southeast Asia, said in an interview that he first came on the animals laid out on market tables. Local farmers and hunters trapped or snared the animals, which they also referred to as rock rats, slaughtered them and took them to market. As far as he knew, Dr. Timmins said, no Western scientists have ever seen a kha-nyou alive.

Dr. Timmins's encounter occurred in the late 1990's, about the time that another scientist, Dr. Mark F. Robinson, independently collected several of the carcasses as specimens. The adults have bodies about a foot long, with a six-inch tail that is not as bushy as a squirrel's. They knew immediately that this was, as Dr. Timmins said, ''an oddball rodent.''

The specimens were sent for analysis at the Natural History Museum in London by Dr. Paulina D. Jenkins, a zoologist, who compared them with known rodents. Tissue samples were sent to the University of Vermont for DNA studies by Dr. C. William Kilpatrick, a molecular scientist.

Only in the last year were the two scientists, as well as the two discoverers, ready to publish their findings. In the journal article, they wrote that the kha-nyou specimens showed ''a unique combination of external and craniodental features as members of a new family, genus and species.''

The researchers named the animal Laonastes aenigmamus, but recommended that it be referred to by the common name of kha-nyou or Laotian rock rat. The animals were found in the eastern edge of the Khammouan Limestone National Biodiversity Conservation Area.

Dr. Timmins said he was not tempted to feast on a rock rat and never thought to ask what it tasted like. A trip to the market, he said, made it clear that ''in Laos, pretty much everything gets eaten.''

	Key to Strains Of Anthrax Is Discovered


Scientists have discovered why different strains of the bacterium that causes anthrax differ so much in virulence, a finding that in theory could produce more effective vaccines and better tools for distinguishing and tracking the lethal germ.

But the finding could also aid the creation of designer varieties of anthrax that are potentially deadlier to humans. Because of that potential danger, a debate occurred over whether the discovery should be kept secret, scientists said. In the end, it was decided that the benefits of publication outweighed the risks.

The discovery was made by six scientists at Louisiana State University, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, the nation's top center for studying germ defenses. It is published in the current Journal of Clinical Microbiology.

The lead author, Dr. Pamala R. Coker, formerly at L.S.U. and now at the Livermore laboratory in California, spearheaded the research for her Ph.D. dissertation. The Livermore laboratory once pioneered nuclear arms but increasingly studies biology and germ defenses.

The team's finding centers on the anthrax genome, which consists of a single large chromosome and two small circles of DNA, known as plasmids, that carry extra genes. The scientists found that, contrary to common belief, each anthrax bacterium carries not just one set of plasmids but up to 243 copies of the first and up to 32 copies of the second, which is known as pX02. The more copies of this plasmid in a bacterial strain, the more it is capable of causing disease, the scientists said.

The research was conducted in guinea pigs. The scientists found, for example, that an anthrax strain from Mozambique that possessed just one pX02 plasmid killed 25 percent of the test animals. But a strain from Australia with 32 copies of the plasmid left all the guinea pigs dead.

The team of scientists also reported that added factors like subtle features of the bacterium's DNA chromosome appeared to help determine virulence. Thus, the anthrax that killed five Americans in the germ attacks of 2001 -- the so-called Ames strain -- was found to possess just two copies of pX02. But it nonetheless killed 62 percent of the guinea pigs.

The pX02 plasmid carries genes that let the anthrax bacterium fashion an outer protein coat that acts as a defensive shield to thwart the immune system of hosts. The scientists suspect that multiple copies of pX02 thicken that coating, letting the germ escape immune damage and multiply to do extensive harm.

Scientists had previously identified 89 types of anthrax as genetically distinct but had failed to discover what determined their wide differences in virulence. The plasmid findings, they said, opened a new window on that question.

''It's very interesting,'' said Dr. Sam Kaplan, a microbiologist at the University of Texas medical school at Houston. ''But a lot more work needs to be done.''

Dr. Martin E. Hugh-Jones, a team member at L.S.U., said the discovery would help scientists understand why some anthrax vaccines are effective and others weak. ''This will allow us to do some very impressive things in coming on with new vaccines,'' Dr. Hugh-Jones added.

It could also aid investigations of germ attacks. Dr. Coker of the Livermore laboratory said the finding could help forensic scientists track down the country and laboratory from which the weapon arose. That, she said, was possible because the plasmid technique acted as a kind of microscope to reveal finer genetic distinctions among the 89 known varieties of anthrax. A match between the attack germ and a library of detailed fingerprints could help locate the perpetrator.

Dr. Coker conceded that the research in theory could also help a genetic engineer make a more deadly form of anthrax by increasing the number of pX02 plasmids.

Dr. Kaplan of the University of Texas, who heads the publication board of the American Society for Microbiology in Washington, said no reviewer or official of the society raised objections to publication of the plasmid paper, even though the White House has urged scientists to screen their work carefully for possible harm to national security.

Steve Wampler, a spokesman at the California laboratory, said the plasmid research was done before Dr. Coker came to Livermore but the laboratory nonetheless put the paper through a careful security review. ''In the end,'' he said, ''it was decided that it was fine to publish.''

In addition to Dr. Coker of Livermore and Dr. Hugh-Jones of L.S.U., the paper's authors are Dr. Kimothy L. Smith of the Livermore laboratory, Patricia F. Fellows of the Army research institute, and Dr. Galena Rybachuck and Dr. Konstantin G. Kousoulas of L.S.U.

A NATION AT WAR: ANTHRAX RESEARCH


	 === Article B ===
	Scientist's Findings Could Aid Anthrax Inquiry


In what could provide a major break in the hunt for the sender of anthrax-laden letters last fall, a researcher studying the case for the F.B.I. says he has distinguished between stocks of the anthrax strain kept in different laboratories.

The method should help tell which laboratory's stock of anthrax is closest to that used by the attacker. That could narrow the search to people with access to that particular laboratory and its stock of anthrax.

The researcher, Dr. Paul Keim of Northern Arizona University, made the announcement here at a national conference on microbial genomes.

Asked which laboratories had provided the stocks he studied, Dr. Keim said his agreement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation prevented him from discussing the case. The F.B.I., which refused to comment on his remarks, has said it has no firm suspects, but it has focused on insiders who may have had access to anthrax in laboratories.

Many strains of anthrax exist, but the one used in the attacks is called Ames, first isolated from a cow in Texas in 1981. Because of the strain's virulence, it was studied for years by the Army's laboratory for biological warfare defense at Fort Detrick, Md., and was distributed to several laboratories in the United States and abroad to help them test vaccines.

After the anthrax attacks, researchers tried to discriminate between the various stocks of Ames to see whether they could pinpoint the laboratory of origin. But since all the stocks came from a single source, the bacteria were essentially members of a single large clone, as alike genetically as identical twins.

A DNA fingerprinting test for anthrax bacteria, similar to the test used on humans in criminal cases, had been developed by Dr. Keim and colleagues.

Dr. Keim's fingerprinting test, which was based on eight points of difference, could not distinguish between the different stocks of Ames anthrax, and he set about trying to develop more markers, which are sites on the DNA at which some anthrax bacteria have a different sequence of DNA letters from other bacteria.

To help in the search for new markers, the National Science Foundation asked the Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville, Md., to decode the full DNA sequence of the anthrax bacteria recovered from Robert Stevens, the photo editor who died in the Florida attack. The institute was already sequencing the full genome of the Ames strain owned by the Fort Detrick laboratory, so it would be in a position to look for DNA differences throughout the bacterium's genome.

The institute focused on the main chromosome of the bacteria, a large ring of DNA now known to contain 5,167,515 DNA letters holding information for 5,960 genes. The bacterium also contains two small rings of DNA known as plasmids, which carry the genes essential for its virulence. The plasmid's DNA was decoded several years ago by scientists at the Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory.

Dr. Keim's success came from studying a site on the second of these plasmids called a poly-A tract. He found that Ames stocks held in different laboratories varied in the number of A's -- one of the four units of DNA -- they contained in the poly-A tract. The number of A's varied from 8 to 25, the exact number depending on the laboratory that provided the stock.

On the basis of the poly-A test, he said, he has been able to distinguish between the Ames strains of anthrax held in four laboratories, and in a natural Ames isolate taken from a goat in 1997. Because of his agreement with the F.B.I., Dr. Keim would not name the laboratories or say from how many other laboratories he had received samples.

But another anthrax expert at the meeting said that if Dr. Keim had samples from all laboratories having the Ames strain, he should be able to say which one the attack strain most resembled and might have already done so.

A NATION CHALLENGED: TRACKING THE DISEASE  Correction:  February 20, 2002, Wednesday  An article last Wednesday about genetic differences among anthrax samples misstated the name of a laboratory that decoded part of the anthrax DNA. It is the Los Alamos National Laboratory, not Nuclear.

	Planet or Not, Pluto Now Has Far-Out Rival


Add a tenth planet to the solar system -- or possibly subtract one.

Astronomers announced yesterday that they had found a lump of rock and ice that was larger than Pluto and the farthest known object in the solar system. The discovery will probably rekindle debate over the definition of ''planet'' and whether Pluto still merits the designation.

The new object -- as yet unnamed, but temporarily known as 2003 UB313 -- is now 9 billion miles away from the Sun, or 97 times as far away as Earth and about three times Pluto's current distance from the Sun. Its 560-year elliptical orbit brings it as close as 3.3 billion miles. Pluto's orbit ranges from 2.7 billion miles to 4.6 billion.

The astronomers do not have an exact size for the new planet, but its brightness and distance tell them that it is larger than Pluto, the smallest of the nine known planets.

''It is guaranteed bigger than Pluto,'' said Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology and a member of the team that made the discovery. ''Even if it were 100 percent reflective, it would be larger than Pluto. It can't be more than 100 percent reflective.''

The discovery was made Jan. 8 at Palomar Observatory in California. Dr. Brown and the other members of the team -- Chadwick A. Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii and David L. Rabinowitz of Yale University -- then found that they had, unknowingly, taken images of the planet, using the observatory's 48-inch telescope, as far back as 2003.

Last year, the same team announced the discovery of a distant body they named Sedna, which, until the latest discovery, had held the title of farthest known object in the solar system. But Sedna, smaller than Pluto, is on a far stranger, 10,500-year orbit that takes it as far out as 84 billion miles.

Dr. Brown said they had a name they have proposed for the planet, but did not want to disclose it until it had been formally approved by the International Astronomical Union. ''We have a name we really like, and we want it to stick,'' he said.

Informally, the astronomers have been calling it Xena after the television series about a Greek warrior princess, which was popular when the astronomers began their systematic sweep of the sky in 2000. ''Because we always wanted to name something Xena,'' Dr. Brown said.

The astronomers were not able to see 2003 UB313 using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, looking for infrared heat emitted by its minus-405 degree surface. That means the planet is less than 1,800 miles in diameter.

What is most surprising is that the orbit of the planet is sharply skewed to most of the rest of the solar system. The orbits of most planets lie close to the same plane as Earth's, known as the ecliptic plane. The orbit of 2003 UB313 is tilted by 44 degrees.

''That blows my mind,'' said Harold Levison of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., who was not involved in the discovery. ''Getting something up that high is very hard.''

The object is also the third brightest in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy bodies that circles beyond Neptune. The new planet could have been easily discovered much sooner if anyone had looked at that part of the sky.

''It's because no one looks that far off the ecliptic,'' Dr. Brown said. ''No one expects to have an inclination that high.''

Another group of astronomers led by José-Luis Ortiz at the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain announced Thursday that they had found a large Kuiper Belt object, designated 2003 EL61, that they thought could be Pluto-size or larger. Dr. Brown's group had been observing the same body, but had not announced it, and their observations had already pinpointed a moon circling 2003 EL61, which constrained the size of the body to 30 percent the mass of Pluto and about 70 percent the diameter.

On his Web site, Dr. Brown wrote that the Spanish group deserved credit, saying his group had gambled that no one else would find the planet. ''We were wrong!'' he said.

Dr. Brown had still hoped to hold back announcements of 2003 UB313 and another large Kuiper Belt object, 2005 FY9, until October, but his hand was tipped by Brian G. Marsden, director of the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Mass., who urged him to make the announcement as soon as possible.

Dr. Marsden said that it was possible by looking on the Internet at the logs of one of the telescopes Dr. Brown's team had been using to find out where they had been pointed. He had, he said, reason to think someone had done that, ''presumably'' in preparation for their own observations.

''I was shocked to find this kind of information was available on the Web,'' Dr. Marsden said.

He urged Dr. Brown to announce his findings. ''I was suspicious and I warned him,'' he said. ''We try to give credit where credit is due.''

Astronomers suddenly have three large bodies, and with one of them larger than Pluto, they will probably revive their debate over what makes a planet.

Astronomers do not have a formal definition of what a planet is, and many have said that if Pluto had been discovered today, it would not have been called a planet. The first of the smaller Kuiper Belt objects were discovered in 1992, 62 years after Clyde Tombaugh found Pluto.

The Minor Planet Center proposed in 1999 that Pluto, while maintaining its position among the major planets, be given a designation among the Kuiper Belt objects. The center dropped the proposal after outcry from those who saw it as a demotion.

Gareth V. Williams, associate director of the center, said he still supported a dual status for Pluto, but did not think 2003 UB313 should be added to the registry of major planets. Mr. Williams said astronomers should ''leave it as a minor planet permanently.''

Mark V. Sykes, a defender of Pluto's planetary status, said his initial inclination would be to classify 2003 UB313 as a planet. He wondered whether it had an atmosphere and what sort of geological processes generated its apparently bright surface. ''The kinds of questions we would ask about this object would be planetlike questions,'' said Dr. Sykes, director of the Planetary Sciences Institute, a research institution in Tucson.

Astronomers will also have to figure out how the body made it to its current skewed orbit. ''It makes Pluto seem less weird,'' Dr. Sykes said.

Dr. Brown said he used to support Mr. Williams's view of Pluto as a minor planet, but ''I've given up on that.'' If Pluto, for historical reasons, has been grandfathered in as a planet, ''this one, I would say, counts out as the 10th planet,'' Dr. Brown said.

Five and a half years ago, Dr. Brown bet an astronomer friend, Sabine Airieau, five bottles of good Champagne that he would find a Kuiper Belt object larger than Pluto by the end of last year. In December, having failed, he bought the five bottles of Champagne to send to her. Then 2003 UB313 turned up on Jan. 8.

''I lost the bet by eight days,'' Dr. Brown said, but ''she graciously decided she would let that window slide and I would win the bet.''

''That means I get to drink 10 bottles of good Champagne,'' he said, ''and I think I will.''

	SCIENTIST AT WORK/Michael Brown; 10 Planets? Why Not 11?


Between feedings and diaper changes of his newborn daughter, Michael E. Brown may yet find an 11th planet.

Once conducted almost exclusively on cold, lonely nights, observational astronomy these days is often done under bright California sunshine.

When he has a few spare minutes, Dr. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, downloads images taken during a previous night by a robotically driven telescope at Palomar Observatory 100 miles away. Each night, the telescope scans a different swath of sky, photographing each patch three times, spaced an hour and a half apart.

In any one of the photographs, a planet or some other icy body at the edge of the solar system looks just like a star. Unlike a star it moves between the exposures.

Dr. Brown's computer programs flag potential discovery candidates for him to inspect. He quickly dismisses almost all of them -- double images caused by a bumping of the telescope, blurriness from whirls in the atmosphere or random noise.

Sometimes, like last Jan. 5, he spots a moving dot.

Dr. Brown had rewritten his software to look for slower-moving and more distant objects.

On that morning, he was sitting in his Caltech office -- unremarkable university turf sparsely decorated with a not-full bottle of Jack Daniel's, a dragon mobile, a dinosaur toothbrush, a Mr. Potato Head and other toys and knickknacks that long predated parenthood -- and re-examining images from nearly a year and a half earlier, Oct. 21, 2003.

The first several candidates offered by the computer were the usual garbled images.

Then he saw it: a bright, unmistakably round dot moving across the star field.

He did a quick calculation. Even if this new object reflected 100 percent of the sunlight that hit it -- and nothing is perfectly reflective -- it would still be almost as large as Pluto.

That meant, without any additional data, Dr. Brown knew he had discovered what could be the 10th planet.

He noted the time: 11:20 a.m. Dr. Brown knew that astrologers would ask because they had asked after earlier discoveries of smaller Kuiper Belt objects.

He thought about a bet he had made with a friend, for five bottles of Champagne, that he would discover something larger than Pluto by Jan. 1, 2005, five days earlier. He sent her an e-mail message asking for a five-day extension.

Dr. Brown seems destined for future astronomy textbooks, either as the discoverer of the first new planet in 75 years or as the man who pushed Pluto out of the planetary pantheon. Astronomers have long argued over whether Pluto should be a planet and speculated that ice balls larger than Pluto might be hiding in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of debris beyond the orbit of Neptune. Several objects approaching the size of Pluto have been discovered in recent years.

Dr. Brown and two colleagues, David Rabinowitz of Yale and Chad Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, are the first to point to something that is almost certainly larger than Pluto.

''If people want to get rid of Pluto, I'm more than happy to get rid of Pluto and say this one isn't a planet, either,'' Dr. Brown said.

''If culturally we would be willing to accept a scientific definition, that would be great,'' he continued. ''The only thing that would make me unhappy is if Pluto remained a planet, and this one was not one.''

So far, little is known about the new planet, which carries the temporary designation of 2003 UB313. It is currently nine billion miles from Sun, at the farthest point of its 560-year orbit.

A couple of centuries from now, its elliptical trajectory will take it within 3.3 billion miles of the Sun, closer than some of Pluto's orbit. And the orbit is surprisingly askew.

While most of the solar system circles the Sun in a flat disc, the new planet's orbit is tilted about 45 degrees from the disc.

Planet finding was not a career goal for Dr. Brown. Until recently, he was among those who argued that nothing in the Kuiper Belt deserved to be called a planet, not even Pluto.

Dr. Brown, 40, grew up in Alabama, a child of the 1970's, which left a mark in his speech patterns. For things he likes, he inevitably calls them ''cool.''

His father, an engineer at I.B.M., had moved to Huntsville to work on the giant Saturn rockets, which were being designed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center to carry astronauts to the Moon.

When he was finishing up his undergraduate degree in physics at Princeton, he thought he would pursue theoretical work in cosmology, devising ideas about how the universe came together.

Then James Peebles, a physics professor at Princeton, mentioned to him how astronomy needed more observers actually looking at the sky.

''That was it,'' Dr. Brown recalled. ''As soon as he said it, I was like, O.K.''

In graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, he still planned to work on the far, far away -- distant galaxies that blast out loud radio signals. His thesis adviser, Hyron Spinrad, made his graduate students also work on comets, because he was interested in them and could not get help otherwise. Dr. Brown was captivated as well. ''I thought, This stuff is cool,'' he said.

That brought his interests inside the solar system. Later Dr. Brown came across a tiny, little-used 24-inch telescope at the Lick Observatory outside San Jose. ''You find the telescope first and then find your thesis program,'' he said.

His thesis topic turned out to be the volcanoes on Io, one of the moons of Jupiter, and how the gases from the volcanoes are swept up into Jupiter's magnetic fields, accelerated into orbit around Jupiter and then slammed back into Io at 125,000 miles per hour.

He entered the planet-searching business through a chance opportunity. When he arrived at Caltech a decade ago, the 48-inch Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar was just finishing up a large sky survey. While many astronomers clamor for use of Palomar's main 200-inch telescope, Dr. Brown realized he could easily get ample time on the smaller one.

So, just as he did at Lick, he looked for a project to fit the telescope.

The first Kuiper Belt object had been discovered a few years earlier, and Dr. Brown thought it would be useful to do a systematic sweep of the sky to look for them. In past centuries, the trick to discovering a planet was knowing exactly where to look. Now, computers and automated telescopes have allowed a new strategy: look everywhere.

Dr. Brown has a love of code names, so he and his colleagues decided if they ever found something larger than Pluto, they would give it the code name Xena, after the television series starring Lucy Lawless as an ancient Greek warrior.

It was also partly a nod to Planet X, a long-hypothesized massive planet in the outer solar system.

In 2002, Dr. Brown and Dr. Trujillo turned up their first big find: a Kuiper Belt object about 775 miles wide, or about as large as Pluto's moon, Charon. They named it Quaoar, after a god in Native American mythology, and learned their first lesson in astronomical discovery: find a pronounceable name. (Quaoar is pronounced KWAH-o-wahr.)

A year later, Dr. Brown, Dr. Trujillo and Dr. Rabinowitz of Yale found something stranger, an object larger than Quaoar and much father out, eight billion miles. And stranger yet, its 11,000-year orbit carries it out as far as 84 billion miles, far beyond anything else known in the solar system.

Initially, they excitedly thought it might be larger than Pluto and called it Xena for a few days. But further measurements and calculations indicated it was probably, at most, three-quarters the diameter of Pluto. When they announced the discovery last year, they gave it the name of Sedna, after an Inuit goddess.

The name was easily pronounceable, but it peeved some astronomers, especially amateur asteroid searchers, who felt Dr. Brown had again flouted the International Astronomical Union's naming rules. The rules prohibit discoverers from publicly announcing any name, even a tentative one, before the union approves it, a process that takes months to years. The critics wanted the union to rebuke Dr. Brown and reject the name.

One amateur astronomer, Reiner M. Stoss, even proposed Sedna as a name for a small, earlier discovered asteroid, to thwart Dr. Brown.

Dr. Brown admitted, ''I consciously broke the rules,'' but he felt that the preliminary designation, 2003 VB12, was too obscure and confusing for a noteworthy addition to the solar system. ''I thought, This is stupid,'' he said. ''This object needs to have a name before it goes public.''

After Sedna, the astronomers also realized that there could be more discoveries lurking in their photographs.

Dr. Brown finds that betting is an effective way to spur scientific progress. He would have found the planet sooner or later, but late last year he realized that his best hope for winning the Champagne bet was to sift through thousands of candidates in the old images.

On Dec. 20, going through the images from the previous May, he discovered a new bright Kuiper Belt object.

It was big, but not big enough. He gave that one the code name of Santa.

When he later discovered a moon around Santa, he gave the moon the code name Rudolph. (When he discovered yet another Kuiper Belt object in April, he continued in the holiday vein and code named that one Easter Bunny. He even had a code name for his daughter before she was born and he and his wife had not yet settled on a name. The whiteboard in his office had a list of tasks labeled ''TDBP'' -- To Do Before Petunia.)

He spent Christmas through New Year's examining old images.

Nothing turned up.

Then on Jan. 5 -- not Jan. 8 as he had said at his news conference -- he finally found one he could call Xena. ''What if it's the size of Mercury?'' he mused in his notes.

This time, Dr. Brown decided to play by the International Astronomical Union's rules and did not announce his real intended name for 2003 UB313, leading to rumors that he had officially proposed Xena.

Meanwhile, Dr. Brown, on family leave until the end of year, found a new set of data to work with: his daughter Lilah's sleeping and eating patterns.

In the hospital, he and his wife had, like many new parents, written down a record of feeding and sleeping times.

Dr. Brown wrote a computer program to generate colorful charts from the information and put them online at lilahbrown.com.

''Who wouldn't be fascinated?'' Dr. Brown asked. ''Well, I guess, most people.''

Black bars indicate the times that his wife, Diane Binney, is breast-feeding Lilah. Blue bars indicate when Dr. Brown is feeding a bottle to her. Green bars indicate the hours Lilah is awake and content; red bars indicate the fussy times.

Dr. Brown said he hoped to find a pattern in Lilah's sleep cycle -- she has been waking up, on average, every 2.5 hours. If one nap lasted only 1.5 hours, would that mean the next nap would last 3.5 hours, giving her parents a chance to rest?

A chart with cloudlike splatter of data points gave the unfortunate answer. ''There is absolutely no correlation,'' Dr. Brown said.

	A New Kind of New Yorker, One With 82 Legs


Scientists have discovered an altogether new creature in Central Park.

It is a centipede -- which may be the world's smallest -- and is the first new animal species found in Central Park in more than a century, scientists say.

The newly found centipede is so unusual that it makes up a new genus, as well as a species, said Dr. Kefyn M. Catley, a Rutgers University professor and staff scientist for the American Museum of Natural History.

A species is a group of similar organisms that under natural conditions breed only with one another. (Dogs are a species.) A genus, a broader category, may consist of 100 or more species, or, as in the case of the city's new centipede, only one. (The Canis genus includes dogs, wolves and coyotes.) Centipede, like mammal, is a class. (A giraffe is both a genus and a species.)

And Central Park may hold more discoveries. A gnat discovered there was unknown to museum scientists and is now being studied in Germany. Dr. Catley said that it could also turn out to be a new species.

Museum researchers found the new centipede, along with many other tiny beings, in leaf litter -- piles of broken twigs, fungi and decomposing plant and tree leaves mixed with soil. Leaf litter is perhaps the ''richest and most complex community in the woods,'' said Dr. Eleanor Sterling, director of the natural history museum's Center for Biodiversity and Conservation. It is, she said, ''predators, scavengers, vegetarians living together in a very complicated system.''

Leaf litter accumulates very quickly, said Liz Johnson, the director of the museum's biodiversity program for the New York region. In one year, five tons can pile up in two and a half acres of woods. Invertebrates consume it and keep it from burying the forest, and there they are as numerous as litter. There are, for instance, some 50,000 springtails (an insect) in one square yard of litter, and that is only one of the hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of invertebrates found there.

The Central Park Conservancy, which is restoring its woods, asked the museum for help in determining what, precisely, is living there in order to best preserve it, Ms. Johnson said.

To find their leaf litter, museum scientists had only to walk across the street and go to the North Woods and the Ramble.

''We didn't know what was out there,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''We wanted to see who's out there in the spring, who's out there in the fall and the summer.''

Four times -- once a season during 1998 -- they collected piles of leaf litter and carried them back to the museum for the painstaking task of separating the creatures from the soil and plant detritus, and dividing the minute animals into categories like worms, beetles and millipedes and centipedes.

The museum sent a collection of Central Park millipedes and centipedes to Richard L. Hoffman, the curator for invertebrates at the Virginia Museum of Natural History. After he had studied them, Dr. Hoffman sent several he could not identify to scientists in Italy who specialize in centipedes and millipedes. They declared that the centipede was a first and named it after him: Nannarrup hoffmani, or Hoffman's dwarf centipede.

''I was astonished,'' Dr. Hoffman said. The odds against it surviving in a densely populated city -- and, in particular, the constant trampling of millions of Central Park visitors -- were astronomical, he said.

Nannarrup hoffmani is 10.3 millimeters long, or about four-tenths of an inch. Centipedes generally range from 3 centimeters, or 1.2 inches, to as long as 14 inches.

All centipedes are predators with poisonous fangs, and eat any animal they can get their jaws around. The new discovery is no exception. ''They're totally mindless killing machines,'' said Dr. Hoffman, who vastly prefers the more peaceable vegetarian millipedes.

Researchers found 10 specimens of Nannarrup hoffmani in the Ramble and the North Woods. Eight are juveniles, one is just a severed head and scattered body parts and one is an adult female. Like the juveniles, it has 41 pairs of legs, an unusually large number for such a small centipede. It is light yellow, a common centipede coloring, with antennas that are proportionally short. The female's interior contained sperm. ''What's exciting is that it is obviously capable of reproducing,'' Ms. Johnson said.

It resembles centipedes from Asia and China more than native ones, Dr. Hoffman said.

''Probably it was brought in with potted soil,'' he said. ''Nobody in Manhattan is native. Exotics have displaced native North American species, just like we did the Indians.''

New species have been discovered in New York State before. The most recent was a type of sawfly found in 1998 in the pitch pine woods of Albany by Dr. Timothy L. McCabe, curator of entomology at the New York State Museum. He said that he could not remember the last time a new genus was found in the state, but that the last new species found in Central Park was a cutworm moth discovered about 120 years ago.

Most North American animals were classified between 1820 and 1920, the golden age of taxonomy, or biological classification.

The discovery of new species of invertebrates is common in tropical rain forests and wild areas throughout the world, Dr. Hoffman said. So scientists rarely even raise an eyebrow when they hear of a new one.

Only 1.5 million of the estimated 10 million to 50 million invertebrates have been identified, Dr. Hoffman said. There is a poignant side to the finding of Nannarrup hoffmani, as least to Dr. Hoffman. Research money for the study of invertebrates is drying up and science-minded young people are choosing molecular biology instead. At the same time, he said, the destruction of rain forests and the development of wilderness are killing off huge numbers of invertebrate species, which will vanish, unknown.

''When I die,'' he said, ''nobody will replace me.''

Ms. Johnson said the discovery of Nannarrup hoffmani gives new reason to appreciate the virtues of natural mess in parks.

''If they rake all the leaves, remove all the fallen twigs and branches, new species -- and the regular guys -- will not survive,'' she said. ''The whole system will cease to function. We need to appreciate unmanicured nature.''

	A Wild, Fearsome World Under Each Fallen Leaf


Dr. Edward O. Wilson, Pellegrino university research professor and honorary curator in entomology of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, winner of two Pulitzer prizes and scientific honors too numerous to recount, is on his hands and knees, pawing in the leaf litter near Walden Pond.

He eases into a half-sitting, half-reclining position and holds out a handful of humus and dirt. ''This,'' he says, ''is wilderness.''

Just a dozen yards from the site of Thoreau's cabin Dr. Wilson is delving into the ground with a sense of purpose and pleasure that would instantly make any 10-year-old join him. His smile suggests that at age 73, with a troublesome right knee, he still finds the forest floor as much to his liking as a professor's desk.

These woods are not wild; indeed they were not wild in Thoreau's day. Today, the beach and trails of Walden Pond State Reservation draw about 500,000 visitors a year. Few of them hunt ants, however. Underfoot and under the leaf litter there is a world as wild as it was before human beings came to this part of North America.

Dr. Wilson is playing guide to this micro-wilderness -- full of ants, mites, millipedes and springtails in a miniature forest of fungal threads and plant detritus in order to make a point about the value of little creatures and small spaces. If he wrote bumper stickers, rather than books, his next might be ''Save the Microfauna'' or ''Sweat the Small Stuff.''

He begins his most recent book, ''The Future of Life,'' with a ''Dear Henry'' letter, talking to Thoreau about the state of the world and the Walden Pond woods.

''Untrammeled nature exists in the dirt and rotting vegetation beneath our shoes,'' he writes. ''The wilderness of ordinary vision may have vanished -- wolf, puma and wolverine no longer exist in the tamed forests of Massachusetts. But another, even more ancient wilderness lives on.''

In their world, centipedes are predators as fearsome as saber-toothed tigers, ants more numerous than the ungulates of African plains. And, in contrast to the vast preserves required by the world's most revered megafauna -- grizzlies and elephants, jaguars and condors -- maintaining biodiversity among the little creatures, shockingly rich in unexplored behavior and biochemistry, can be done on the cheap, in relatively tiny patches, as small as a few acres, around the world.

Dr. Wilson is by no means turning from the grand plans for conservation. Indeed, he has suggested that 50 percent of the globe ought to be reserved for nonhuman nature. But he is a realist, and, as he describes himself, ''a lover of little things.''

He has been turning over logs and rocks looking into the world of insects and other tiny creatures since he was a boy in Alabama and Florida. And he has not stopped. During the walk, he talks enthusiastically about a coming field trip to the Dominican Republic to investigate ants there, and about the publication this fall of a book-length monograph on the genus Pheidole describing all 625 species of ants, including 341 new to science.

Researchers tend to share a kind of acquisitive passion to see, touch, grasp the world. Nothing passes without comment. As he strolled along the shore of Walden Pond, on the way to the woods, Dr. Wilson spotted a butterfly and interrupted his discussion of the sizes of reserves needed for mammals, reptiles and amphibians, complete with references and citations to scientific studies.

When the butterfly landed on the beach, Dr. Wilson stopped, leaning forward like a heron on the hunt, and peered at it. ''It's hard to identify,'' he said. ''It's a very beat-up little butterfly,'' probably the variety called a question mark, because of the design on its wings.

Having reached the woods and having begun to talk about what lay under the surface of the forest floor, he held the crumbled leaf litter and humus in his hand as if he were savoring what lovers of certain wines call the ''goût de terroir,'' or taste of the soil, a certain earthy specificity that the wine owes to the ground, not the grape.

''When I go on a field trip,'' he said, ''providing you can get me up to the edge of a natural environment, I usually don't go more than a hundred yards or so in, because when I settle down immediately I start finding interesting stuff.''

''This ground,'' he said, ''we see it as two-dimensional because we're gigantic, like Godzilla. When you just go a few centimeters down, then you're in a three-dimensional world where the conditions change dramatically almost millimeter by millimeter. In one square foot of this litter you're looking at into the tens of thousands of small creatures that you can still spot with your naked eye.''

The ground was drier than usual, and Dr. Wilson speculated that the drought might have affected insects. Some he had hoped to see were not there. ''If we looked long enough,'' he said, breaking open several rotting acorns, ''we would find entire colonies of very small ants living in an acorn.''

As he moved on, from log to log, he uncovered relatives of cave crickets, predatory rove beetles, termites, several varieties of ants, spiderlings, beetle larvae -- not quite in the abundance he had hoped for. Still, the small wilderness was teeming.

''The exact perception of wilderness is a matter of scale,'' he writes in ''The Future of Life,'' going on to say that ''microaesthetics'' is ''an unexplored wilderness to the creative mind.'' But he also notes that while microreserves are ''infinitely better than nothing at all, they are no substitute for macro-  and megareserves.'' He continues, ''People can acquire an appreciation for savage carnivorous nematodes and shape-shifting rotifers in a drop of pond water, but they need life on the larger scale to which the human intellect and emotion most naturally respond.''

Dr. Wilson is no sentimentalist, about nematodes or people. His proposals for microreserves are practical and hard-headed. The idea is fairly simple. While areas of nearly 25,000 acres are needed to have a good chance at preserving most large forms of life, plants and insects can sometimes be preserved in plots of 25 or even 2.5 acres.

In the Amazon, for instance, Dr. Wilson said, where the land is being savaged, ''You'll see hanging on the side of a ravine somewhere a patch a farmer hasn't farmed, one hectare, to maybe 10.'' Such a small area may not catch the eye of most conservationists, he said, but, he added, ''The entomologist and the botanist is likely to say, hold on a minute.''

A researcher, he said, may find species not found anywhere else, and such plots can grow, with care and reseeding of the surrounding area. ''You can do this in most parts of the world, in most developing countries, where a farmer or village elders would happily take a thousand bucks for you to set aside 10 or 100 hectares and even hire them to help with the reseeding,'' he said.

But it is not just the developing world where biodiversity can be preserved, bit by bit. City parks may hold small wonders. Even at Walden Pond, in the midst of the Massachusetts suburbs, he said: ''Many of the species you find here are new to science. The basic biology of most of these things is poorly known or not known at all.''

In the Walden woods live two relatively unknown ant species in the genus Myrmica. ''They've been noticed, but not named or described,'' he said. As to the nematodes and mites, he said, lifetimes can be spent and careers can be made studying them.

It is not, of course, entomologists, or even weekend naturalists, who need convincing about the richness of the forest floor. And there are many reasons to try to preserve biological diversity at the near-microscopic level and below. There is always potential economic value in new biochemical discoveries. There is real and present economic value in clean air and water, to which the plants and insects and microbes contribute. In fact, Dr. Wilson points out, the life of the planet is built on a foundation of tiny creatures. In ecological systems it is the giants that stand on the shoulders of mites.

Finally, there is the simplest argument of all, that life itself, in all its variations, is astonishing and mysterious, and that humans have a responsibility to preserve it.

Under one log turned over on our walk, the environment was moist enough to provide a widely varied selections of insects. Dr. Wilson picked up a gooey white worm without a trace of discomfort. ''That is a fly larva, a maggot actually,'' he said. ''I don't know the kind of fly. It's very slimy.''

Asked if he might be demonstrating the very reason many people do not like to turn over logs and dig under leaves, he laughed. ''I'll admit it's an acquired taste,'' he said. ''Don't mistake me, I don't expect legions of people, particularly Americans, going out and seeing how many different kinds of oribatid mites or fly larvae they can find.''

''But,'' he continued, ''they can get a feel, one way or the other, that what's at their feet is not dead leaves and dirt, but a living world with a diversity of creatures, some of which are so strange to the average experience that they beat most of the things you see in Star Wars.''

It is not so hard to imagine. Butterfly fanciers are legion. Dragonflies are now attracting watchers with binoculars. ''But mainly,'' he said, ''there's got to be some sense of the beauty and integrity and the extreme age of these areas.''

At the next and last log, he pointed out a predatory rove beetle, a millipede (a detritovore), a spiderling, a nematode he caught only a glimpse of (''like a very tiny silvery strand''), more ants and a wood cockroach. As he began to describe the thousands of inoffensive species of cockroach throughout the world, a siren went off on a nearby street, a reminder of where he was.

Dr. Wilson looked up from the timeless environment under the log, ''That's sure a sound that Thoreau never heard.''

	One for the Ages: A Prescription That May Extend Life


How depressing, how utterly unjust, to be the one in your social circle who is aging least gracefully.

In a laboratory at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Matthias is learning about time's caprice the hard way. At 28, getting on for a rhesus monkey, Matthias is losing his hair, lugging a paunch and getting a face full of wrinkles.

Yet in the cage next to his, gleefully hooting at strangers, one of Matthias's lab mates, Rudy, is the picture of monkey vitality, although he is slightly older. Thin and feisty, Rudy stops grooming his smooth coat just long enough to pirouette toward a proffered piece of fruit.

Tempted with the same treat, Matthias rises wearily and extends a frail hand. ''You can really see the difference,'' said Dr. Ricki Colman, an associate scientist at the center who cares for the animals.

What a visitor cannot see may be even more interesting. As a result of a simple lifestyle intervention, Rudy and primates like him seem poised to live very long, very vital lives.

This approach, called calorie restriction, involves eating about 30 percent fewer calories than normal while still getting adequate amounts of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. Aside from direct genetic manipulation, calorie restriction is the only strategy known to extend life consistently in a variety of animal species.

How this drastic diet affects the body has been the subject of intense research. Recently, the effort has begun to bear fruit, producing a steady stream of studies indicating that the rate of aging is plastic, not fixed, and that it can be manipulated.

In the last year, calorie-restricted diets have been shown in various animals to affect molecular pathways likely to be involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's disease and cancer. Earlier this year, researchers studying dietary effects on humans went so far as to claim that calorie restriction may be more effective than exercise at preventing age-related diseases.

Monkeys like Rudy seem to be proving the thesis. Recent tests show that the animals on restricted diets, including Canto and Eeyore, two other rhesus monkeys at the primate research center, are in indisputably better health as they near old age than Matthias and other normally fed lab mates like Owen and Johann. The average lifespan for laboratory monkeys is 27.

The findings cast doubt on long-held scientific and cultural beliefs regarding the inevitability of the body's decline. They also suggest that other interventions, which include new drugs, may retard aging even if the diet itself should prove ineffective in humans. One leading candidate, a newly synthesized form of resveratrol -- an antioxidant present in large amounts in red wine -- is already being tested in patients. It may eventually be the first of a new class of anti-aging drugs. Extrapolating from recent animal findings, Dr. Richard A. Miller, a pathologist at the University of Michigan, estimated that a pill mimicking the effects of calorie restriction might increase human life span to about 112 healthy years, with the occasional senior living until 140, though some experts view that projection as overly optimistic.

According to a report by the Rand Corporation, such a drug would be among the most cost-effective breakthroughs possible in medicine, providing Americans more healthy years at less expense (an estimated $8,800 a year) than new cancer vaccines or stroke treatments.

''The effects are global, so calorie restriction has the potential to help us identify anti-aging mechanisms throughout the body,'' said Richard Weindruch, a gerontologist at the University of Wisconsin who directs research on the monkeys.

Many scientists regard the study of life extension, once just a reliable plotline in science fiction, as a national priority. The number of Americans 65 and older will double in the next 25 years to about 72 million, according to government census data. By then, seniors will account for nearly 20 percent of the population, up from just 12 percent in 2003.

Earlier this year, four prominent gerontologists, among them Dr. Miller, published a paper calling for the government to spend $3 billion annually in pursuit of a modest goal: delaying the onset of age-related diseases by seven years.

Doing so, the authors asserted, would lay the foundation for a healthier and wealthier country, a so-called longevity dividend.

''The demographic wave entering their 60s is enormous, and that is likely to greatly increase the prevalence of diseases like diabetes and heart disease,'' said Dr. S. Jay Olshansky, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and one of the paper's authors. ''The simplest way to positively affect them all is to slow down aging.''

Science, of course, is still a long way from doing anything of the sort. Aging is a complicated phenomenon, the intersection of an array of biological processes set in motion by genetics, lifestyle, even evolution itself.

Still, in laboratories around the world, scientists are becoming adept at breeding animal Methuselahs, extraordinarily long lived and healthy worms, fish, mice and flies.

In 1935, Dr. Clive McCay, a nutritionist at Cornell University, discovered that mice that were fed 30 percent fewer calories lived about 40 percent longer than their free-grazing laboratory mates. The dieting mice were also more physically active and far less prone to the diseases of advanced age.

Dr. McCay's experiment has been successfully duplicated in a variety of species. In almost every instance, the subjects on low-calorie diets have proven to be not just longer lived, but also more resistant to age-related ailments.

''In mice, calorie restriction doesn't just extend life span,'' said Leonard P. Guarente, professor of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''It mitigates many diseases of aging: cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease. The gain is just enormous.''

For years, scientists financed by the National Institute on Aging have closely monitored rhesus monkeys on restricted and normal-calorie diets. At the University of Wisconsin, where 50 animals survive from the original group of 76, the differences are just now becoming apparent in the older animals.

Those on normal diets, like Matthias, are beginning to show signs of advancing age similar to those seen in humans. Three of them, for instance, have developed diabetes, and a fourth has died of the disease. Five have died of cancer.

But Rudy and his colleagues on low-calorie meal plans are faring better. None have diabetes, and only three have died of cancer. It is too early to know if they will outlive their lab mates, but the dieters here and at the other labs also have lower blood pressure and lower blood levels of certain dangerous fats, glucose and insulin.

''The preliminary indicators are that we're looking at a robust life extension in the restricted animals,'' Dr. Weindruch said.

Despite widespread scientific enthusiasm, the evidence that calorie restriction works in humans is indirect at best. The practice was popularized in diet books by Dr. Roy Walford, a legendary pathologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who spent much of the last 30 years of his life following a calorie-restricted regimen. He died of Lou Gehrig's disease in 2004 at 79.

Largely as a result of his advocacy, several thousand people are now on calorie-restricted diets in the United States, says Brian M. Delaney, president of the Calorie Restriction Society.

Mike Linksvayer, a 36-year-old chief technology officer at a San Francisco nonprofit group, embarked on just such a diet six years ago. On an average day, he eats an apple or some cereal for breakfast, followed by a small vegan dish at lunch. Dinner is whatever his wife has cooked, excluding bread, rice, sugar and whatever else Mr. Linksvayer deems unhealthy (this often includes the entrée). On weekends, he occasionally fasts.

Mr. Linksvayer, 6 feet tall and 135 pounds, estimated that he gets by on about 2,000 to 2,100 calories a day, a low number for men of his age and activity level, and his blood pressure is a remarkably low 112 over 63. He said he has never been in better health.

''I don't really get sick,'' he said. ''Mostly I do the diet to be healthier, but if it helps me live longer, hey, I'll take that, too.''

Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have been tracking the health of small groups of calorie-restricted dieters. Earlier this year, they reported that the dieters had better-functioning hearts and fewer signs of inflammation, which is a precursor to clogged arteries, than similar subjects on regular diets.

In previous studies, people in calorie-restricted groups were shown to have lower levels of LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, and triglycerides. They also showed higher levels of HDL, the so-called good cholesterol, virtually no arterial blockage and, like Mr. Linksvayer, remarkably low blood pressure.

''Calorie restriction has a powerful, protective effect against diseases associated with aging,'' said Dr. John O. Holloszy, a Washington University professor of medicine. ''We don't know how long each individual will end up living, but they certainly have a longer life expectancy than average.''

Researchers at Louisiana State University reported in April in The Journal of the American Medical Association that patients on an experimental low-calorie diet had lower insulin levels and body temperatures, both possible markers of longevity, and fewer signs of the chromosomal damage typically associated with aging.

These studies and others have led many scientists to believe they have stumbled onto a central determinant of natural life span. Animals on restricted diets seem particularly resistant to environmental stresses like oxidation and heat, perhaps even radiation. ''It is a very deep, very important function,'' Dr. Miller said. Experts theorize that limited access to energy alarms the body, so to speak, activating a cascade of biochemical signals that tell each cell to direct energy away from reproductive functions, toward repair and maintenance. The calorie-restricted organism is stronger, according to this hypothesis, because individual cells are more efficiently repairing mutations, using energy, defending themselves and mopping up harmful byproducts like free radicals.

''The stressed cell is really pulling out all the stops'' to preserve itself, said Dr. Cynthia Kenyon, a molecular biologist at the University of California, San Francisco. ''This system could have evolved as a way of letting animals take a timeout from reproduction when times are harsh.''

But many experts are unsettled by the prospect, however unlikely, of Americans adopting a draconian diet in hopes of living longer. Even the current epidemiological data, they note, do not consistently show that those who are thinnest live longest. After analyzing decades of national mortality statistics, federal researchers reported last year that exceptional thinness, a logical consequence of calorie restriction, was associated with an increased risk of death. This controversial study did not attempt to assess the number of calories the subjects had been consuming, or the quality of their diets, which may have had an effect on mortality rates.

Despite the initially promising results from studies of primates, some scientists doubt that calorie restriction can ever work effectively in humans. A mathematical model published last year by researchers at University of California, Los Angeles, and University of California, Irvine, predicted that the maximum life span gain from calorie restriction for humans would be just 7 percent. A more likely figure, the authors said, was 2 percent.

''Calorie restriction is doomed to fail, and will make people miserable in the process of attempting it,'' said Dr. Jay Phelan, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a co-author of the paper. ''We do see benefits, but not an increase in life span.''

Mice who must scratch for food for a couple of years would be analogous, in terms of natural selection, to humans who must survive 20-year famines, Dr. Phelan said. But nature seldom demands that humans endure such conditions.

Besides, he added, there is virtually no chance Americans will adopt such a severe menu plan in great numbers.

''Have you ever tried to go without food for a day?'' Dr. Phelan asked. ''I did it once, because I was curious about what the mice in my lab experienced, and I couldn't even function at the end of the day.''

Even researchers who believe calorie restriction can extend life in humans concede that few Americans are likely to stick to such a restrained diet over a long period. The aging of the body is the aging of its cells, researchers like to say. While cell death is hardwired into every organism's DNA, much of the infirmity that comes with advancing years is from an accumulation of molecular insults that, experts contend, may to some degree be prevented, even reversed.

''The goal is not just to make people live longer,'' said Dr. David A. Sinclair, a molecular biologist at Harvard. ''It's to see eventually that an 80-year-old feels like a 50-year-old does today.''

In a series of studies, Dr. Kenyon, of the University of California, San Francisco, has created mutant roundworms that live six times longer than normal, largely because of a mutation in a single gene called daf-2. The gene encodes a receptor on the surface of cells similar to a receptor in humans that responds to two important hormones, insulin and the insulin-like growth factor 1 or IGF-1.

Insulin is necessary for the body to transport glucose into cells to fuel their operations. Dr. Kenyon and other researchers suggest that worm cells with mutated receptors may be ''tricked'' into sensing that nutrients are not available, even when they are. With its maintenance machinery thereby turned on high, each worm cell lives far longer -- and so does the worm.

Many experts are now convinced that the energy-signaling pathways that employ insulin and IGF-1 are very involved in fixing an organism's life span. Some researchers have even described Type 2 diabetes, which is marked by insensitivity to the hormone insulin, as simply an accelerated form of aging.

In yeast, scientists have discovered a gene similar to daf-2 called SIR2, that also helps to coordinate the cell's defensive response once activated by calorie restriction or another external stressor. The genes encode proteins called sirtuins, which are found in both plants and animals.

A mammalian version of the SIR2 gene, called SIRT1, has been shown to regulate a number of processes necessary for long-term survival in calorie-restricted mice.

Scientists are now trying to develop synthetic compounds that affect the genes daf-2 and SIRT1.

Several candidate drugs designed to prevent age-related diseases, particularly diabetes, are on the drawing boards at biotech companies. Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, in Boston, already has begun testing a new drug in patients with Type 2 diabetes that acts on SIRT1 to improve the functioning of mitochondria, the cell's energy factories.

While an anti-aging pill may be the next big blockbuster, some ethicists believe that the all-out determination to extend life span is veined with arrogance. As appointments with death are postponed, says Dr. Leon R. Kass, former chairman of the President's Council on Bioethics, human lives may become less engaging, less meaningful, even less beautiful.

''Mortality makes life matter,'' Dr. Kass recently wrote. ''Immortality is a kind of oblivion -- like death itself.''

That man's time on this planet is limited, and rightfully so, is a cultural belief deeply held by many. But whether an increasing life span affords greater opportunity to find meaning or distracts from the pursuit, the prospect has become too great a temptation to ignore -- least of all, for scientists.

''It's a just big waste of talent and wisdom to have people die in their 60s and 70s,'' said Dr. Sinclair of Harvard.

	A Pill to Extend Life? Don't Dismiss the Notion Too Quickly


Offering a sharp insight into the nature of aging, biologists report today that they have shown precisely why a calorically restricted diet prolongs life span, at least in a lower organism. The finding, should it prove true of people too, would open the possibility of developing drugs to mimic the effects and gain the remarkable benefits of the draconian low-calorie diet.

Laboratory rats and mice live up to 40 percent longer than usual when fed a diet that has at least 30 percent fewer calories than they would usually eat though otherwise contains all necessary vitamins and nutrients. The animals are free of age-related disease and appear healthy in every respect except that they are generally less fertile.

Studies with rhesus monkeys, which usually live around 25 years, have not been in progress for long enough to say if caloric restriction is likely to benefit primates like monkeys and people, though initial signs are positive.

Even if caloric restriction does prove to prolong human life, very few people could adhere to such a meager diet. Other means, ideally a simple pill, might capture the benefits. But drugs require a target to act on, and the mechanism by which caloric restriction affects life span has long been a mystery.

The issue now seems to have been settled at least in yeast, a widely studied laboratory organism whose metabolism is similar to that of animals in many fundamental ways.

Dr. Leonard Guarente and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology report in today's issue of Science that caloric restriction extends life span in yeast because it interacts with a gene that controls the activity of DNA, the genetic material.

The gene is known as SIR2, for silent information regulator No. 2, and its product, the SIR2 protein, silences genes by making the material that clads the DNA wrap more tightly, thus denying a cell access to the underlying genes.

The SIR2 gene has a direct effect on the yeast cell's longevity; Dr. Guarente previously found that yeast cells in which the gene had been disrupted lived shorter lives than usual, while those given an extra copy of SIR2 lived longer.

Gene silencing is probably of great importance to the integrity of a cell because to have the wrong genes activated could derange a cell's function. Dr. Guarente believes that inefficient silencing in cells could explain many of the infirmities of age.

He and colleagues have now found that caloric restriction appears to work through the SIR2 gene pathway. Yeast cells grown with very little of their food, sugar in the form of glucose, lived longer than normal, but not if their SIR2 gene was disrupted.

The reason seems to be that both the cell's glucose metabolism system, and the protein made by the SIR2 gene, compete for the same chemical, a substance known as NAD. The SIR2 protein cannot perform its silencing duties unless it has NAD to help it, but when the cell is busily converting glucose to energy, there is less NAD available for the SIR2 protein.

Dr. Guarente's next project is to see if his findings in yeast are also true of higher organisms. Both mice and people have their own versions of the SIR2 gene, and the protein requires NAD to function.

The mechanism makes evolutionary sense, Dr. Guarente said, because when food is scarce an organism's best strategy is to postpone reproduction and wait until conditions improve. So a gene like SIR2 that linked greater longevity to lower calorie intake would be highly favored by the forces of natural selection.

Dr. Tomas A. Prolla, a geneticist who studies aging at the University of Wisconsin, said Dr. Guarente's report was the first to link the life extension effects of caloric restriction to a single gene.

''If the find can be translated to animals, it will be very important,'' Dr. Prolla said, because it would provide ''a starting point in the design of drugs which would have a broad effect on human health, including cancer.''

The 40 percent life extension seen under caloric restriction could be just a hint of what would be possible once the underlying mechanism is understood. ''I don't think a 30-40 percent range should be considered as some kind of maximum,'' Dr. Prolla said.

Dr. George S. Roth of the National Institute of Aging, who has been conducting a calorie restriction study on rhesus monkeys since 1987, said there had been fewer deaths so far among the dieting monkeys, which receive 30 percent fewer calories, than among a comparison group that feeds normally.

The mortality difference is not yet statistically significant, Dr. Roth said, but the restricted monkeys have already developed metabolic patterns suggesting they will prove more resistant to diabetes and heart disease.

There is an interesting difference of opinion on the subject of aging between evolutionary biologists, who believe for strong theoretical reasons that aging must be influenced by many different genes, and molecular biologists who have found they can extend the life of laboratory organisms by altering single genes.

Reflecting this difference, Dr. Michael Rose, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California at Irvine, said that the work with yeast was ''really nice and elegant'' but that Dr. Guarente was mistaken in arguing that gene silencing or any other single mechanism of aging was likely to be universal.

Dr. Guarente acknowledged that many genes might be involved in aging. But there is likely to be a single major genetic pathway, he said, in the form of a mechanism to slow aging in response to food scarcity, because any such mechanism would be heavily favored by the forces of natural selection.

	SCIENTIST AT WORK: Joan Roughgarden; A Theorist With Personal Experience Of the Divide Between the Sexes


Speaking to a standing room only crowd at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America in Snowbird, Utah, Dr. Joan Roughgarden, one of the world's most influential theoretical ecologists, is methodically taking apart the way that biologists think about sex.

Providing details that make some titter and shift nervously in their seats, she is re-thinking orgasms and the architecture of female genitals, making arguments for the existence of more than two genders and presenting evidence for widespread homosexual copulation in the wild.

''What's coming out now is to the rest of the species what the Kinsey Report was to humans,'' she says later, discussing recent research.

Described as a visionary and iconoclast who consistently ignores disciplinary and conceptual boundaries, Dr. Roughgarden always draws a good crowd. But on this August day the room is packed, in part because this is not just more talk about science, but the outgrowth of a personal experience that two years ago riveted this entire community of scientists.

That was when Dr. Roughgarden crossed the most rigidly enforced boundary of all, the divide between the sexes. Born Jonathan Roughgarden, she became Joan in the spring of 1998 -- a profound transformation that has led her not only onto new paths in science but into San Francisco politics as well.

''People are wrapping their minds around this,'' said Dr. Roughgarden of re-meeting colleagues. ''They don't quite know what to say.''

Whatever they may have been thinking about Dr. Roughgarden herself, the ecologists at the meeting seemed to welcome the new work, though it remains to be seen whether her radically different views of sex and mating will take hold, or be dismissed.

''This is the usual sort of mold-breaking creativity that she brings to a problem, not just this problem,'' said Dr. Steve Pacala, an ecologist at Princeton.  ''Just because she broke her own mold it's particularly applicable here, but the kind of thing she always does with a problem is think about it afresh.''

For those who knew Dr. Jonathan Roughgarden well, and the many more who knew him only through his prolific production of scientific papers and books, it came as a much-discussed surprise when this Stanford professor, then 52, announced on his Web site that he was a transsexual, posting pictures of himself as Joan.

''It became clear to me that I wasn't ever going to figure out how to do the guy thing,'' Dr. Roughgarden said. She believes that gender is a matter of cognition, an instinctive ability and desire to learn a certain way of being, she said. ''Imagine as a woman if you'd set out to be a man, to learn how to live as a man. Could you do it? I couldn't. It's like asking a fish to fly.''

She said the light dawned on her one day as she sat in a department faculty meeting. ''There were all these guys around this table, staking out their territories and going at one another,'' she said. ''After a while I said, you know, this is not a battle you want to win. You don't want to be like them.''

But as Jonathan, Dr. Roughgarden, who in her own mind has always identified herself as female, was universally regarded as the quintessential macho academic: aggressive, abrasive and competitive.

''Aggressiveness is the easiest male trait to emulate,'' she explained in a recent interview at her apartment in San Francisco, where she has taken the unusual step for a high-powered academic of running for a public office. ''It's easy to duplicate.''

Such behavior, along with the talent to back it up, can play well in the male-dominated world of theoretical ecology, in which scientists study ecology using mathematical models, and in which Jonathan Roughgarden was at the top of his game.

''I don't think there are a lot of people who have been so influential or sweeping in their approach,'' said Dr. Ted Case, a theoretical ecologist at University of California at San Diego.

The transformation to Joan, Dr. Case said, appears not to have diminished Dr. Roughgarden's status in the field. Her gift, he said, is ''to look at the natural world and convert it to math.'' He added, ''I've looked forward to a new paper by Joan or Jon the way the world looks forward to the next Harry Potter book.''

Known for her itinerant interests, Dr. Roughgarden has boiled down into mathematical expression complex ecological phenomena, including what drives some species to produce many offspring and others to produce just a few, and how predators decide which prey to chase and which to let scramble away.

And, unlike most theoreticians, Dr. Roughgarden has gotten her hands dirty doing field studies, looking, for example, at competition between lizards on the Caribbean islands. Even now, in addition to her work on sex and gender, she continues work on very different projects, including developing a theory on the relationship between economics and ecology.

In many ways, Dr. Roughgarden's transition to life as a woman mirrors that of other transsexuals. Tall, slender and somewhat androgynous looking, she has spent two years preoccupied with her physical appearance as she made the transition from one gender to another. Over the same period, she also settled into a softer, more traditionally feminine demeanor.

Moderating a discussion at the meetings in Snowbird, she operated as colleagues said Jonathan never would have: seeking out consensus, affirming others' opinions, welcoming dialogue.

Other scientists universally describe Joan as friendlier, more nurturing and significantly happier-seeming than Jon.

''I've seen Joan smile more in two years than I saw Jon smile in the last 20,'' said Dr. Paul Ehrlich, an ecologist and longtime colleague of Dr. Roughgarden's at Stanford.

Dr. Roughgarden insists she is in many ways entirely unchanged. She acknowledges, however, that life as a woman is quite different.

''At first I was amused,'' Dr. Roughgarden said, describing how she is now much more frequently interrupted, ignored and condescended to by men, particularly those who did not know her as Jonathan. ''I thought, if women are discriminated against, then I'm darn well going to be discriminated against the same way. Well, the thrill of that's worn off, I can tell you.''

Dr. Roughgarden's transformation is leading toward what she hopes will be a change in how biologists think about gender, courtship and reproduction.

In the world view of nearly all biologists, there are males and there are females and they mate only with one another. Dr. Roughgarden likewise had not questioned these most basic of premises. But that began to change when, seeking to understand what science could tell her about herself as a transsexual, she began reviewing the literature. She presents her results in ''Evolution's Rainbow,'' a book to be published by Princeton University Press.

What she found, she said, was that biologists have been unsuccessfully trying to cram the immense variation in nature -- the rainbows, as she calls them, both in gender and mating -- into overly simple, outdated categories.

''There are two sexes,'' she said, meaning females that produce large reproductive cells like eggs and males that produce small ones, like sperm. ''But how you package those sexes is all over the waterfront.''

Hermaphrodites, for example, which can produce both eggs and sperm, do not fit the standard male or female definitions, yet they are widespread in nature. In some species, male-female lines are blurred where sexual identities are flexible.

In fish known as wrasses, for example, some large females change into males later in life and have harems of females, while small males remain male for life, mating with females under the large males' control. Some females remain female for life.

Curiously, Dr. Roughgarden noted, biologists consider females that turn into large males to be the standard males while the life-long males are considered ''sneakers'' and are described as having an alternative mating strategy.

In Dr. Roughgarden's framework, rather than designate any type as the normal or alternative, scientists would recognize the fundamental difference between these three differently sexed, shaped, sized and behaving fish and designate them as different genders.

Dr. Roughgarden said scientists had also been shockingly blind to same-sex mating.

''There are 303 published examples of species with same-sex courtship,'' she said of behaviors typically discounted as anomalies. ''We know examples are suppressed. No one wants to say the organism they work on is gay.''

Rather than view mating through the conventional lens of sexual selection, in which competing males vie for choosy females and in which same-sex courtship becomes invisible, she suggests biologists think instead in terms of the evolution of courtship and mating in general -- between males, between females as well as between females and males. In fact, Dr. Roughgarden argues that same-sex copulation is so widespread that scientists must test the idea that, rather than being a mistake, homosexual behaviors may have some advantages in an evolutionary sense.

Just as she hopes the work of gay and transsexual scientists will improve the scientific understanding of sex and mating, Dr. Roughgarden said she believed a wide diversity of perspectives would lead to better governance. For that reason, she is running for the half-time, city council-like position of district supervisor for District 6, which includes some of the poorest parts of San Francisco.

''I got tired of people saying we need to convince the politicians,'' she said, referring to the common lament of scientists who feel their perspective is lost or misunderstood by politicians and the public. ''Instead of trying to convince them, let's just do it.''

Walking through the district with Dr. Roughgarden, one sees the beginnings of what is promised to be a upscale new development, called Mission Bay, which includes a new University of California campus. It sits alongside neighborhoods where  homeless people sleep in doorways and others pick through the trash.

''Some ecological thinking could really help,'' said Dr. Roughgarden, who has promised to use her expertise in the analyses of complex systems to rethink the growth of District 6. She has already crunched the numbers.

''The displacement of people will be enormous,'' she said.''And they're not going to go quietly.''

To create more of a sense of community between the new campus and the rest of the district, Dr. Roughgarden is proposing that two large piers extending into the bay near the university be developed as Diversity Plaza, home to a statue celebrating diversity. ''I imagine it as the West Coast's equivalent to the Statue of Liberty,'' she said.

Hank Wilson, a longtime community activist and a friendly competitor running for the same office, said Dr. Roughgarden, a political novice, and Diversity Plaza had captured people's imagination. ''Joan is on people's radar screen,'' he said.

Always mathematically minded, Dr. Roughgarden notes that with 17 candidates vying for the position and no incumbent, everyone theoretically has a chance. Still, considered a dark horse, she remains philosophical about where she has come from and where she is going.

''One thing I've learned is that almost all professional women have had a very nonlinear path to get where they are,'' said Dr. Roughgarden, who said she intended to pursue her science whatever the outcome on Nov. 7. ''It's taken me a while to get here, but we've all got a story.''

	Are Men Necessary?


Well, are they?

A recently separated friend sniffed at the idea of a whole 600 words on the subject.

''Since the answer is 'no,' '' she said, ''I don't quite see what you can do for the other 599.'' In fact, if men are on earth solely to preserve the species, there is already enough DNA in sperm banks to last for ages. Advances in cryogenics and turkey basting have rendered human males largely superfluous.

Other women interviewed defended their own irreplaceability -- an artificial womb is still years off -- but argued that men, though an anachronism, do have some impractical value.

''Geez, I'd miss sex,'' one said.

Another asked, ''If there weren't gay men,'' who would help women check out the jeans-clad courtship displays of breeding males?

But the blunt fact is that human females rarely get to choose to eliminate males. The world is patriarchical because male aggression makes for a winning reproductive strategy, said Dr. Barbara B. Smuts, a feminist sociobiologist.

Male chimps, seeking many partners, dominate females who otherwise, Dr. Smuts argues, would accept sex only with the most qualified male.

In that regard, humans imitate chimps, not our other closest relatives, bonobos, whose females band together to fight off unwanted males.

Among lower animals and insects, as described by the evolutionary biologist Dr. Olivia Judson, the notion of ''choosing'' males is not so prevalent.

Insomniac male brown bats rape their way through hibernating roosts. Male honeybees explode upon climax, leaving their genitals behind in the queen as a chastity belt.

Male green spoon worms live inside a female's reproductive tract to fertilize passing eggs; they reach it by getting close enough to the females, who are 200,000 times their size, to be inhaled.

Male Australian redback spiders not only somersault into their mates' fangs to be eaten while copulating, they also fight for the privilege, pulling rivals from the females' jaws and hogtying them with silk.

The engine behind all this is the Y chromosome, which determines maleness. Scholars have recently mocked it as a genetic cul de sac.

Over the eons, more than 900 of its 1,000 genes have shifted to other chromosomes, and it could theoretically become extinct in 10 million years. ''Man's defining structure is a haven for degenerates,'' Steve Jones, a geneticist at the University College London, writes in his recent book ''Y: The Descent of Men.''

But advancing chromosomal recombination is the point of sex, and advancing sex is the point of pheromones, courtship displays, the taking of female captives in war and romantic love. Consequently, said Dr. David C. Page, a specialist in Y chromosomes at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., without males there would not only be no war, but also ''no poetry, literature, music, advertising or fashion.'' ''A Thousand Clones'' makes lousy drama.

That raises a question: sex, yes, but why separate sexes? Hermaphroditic California sea hares mate happily in chains -- male end to female end to male end to female end -- beneath the waves. Why can't we all?

The answer: no one knows. Above the fish-and-slug level, in reptiles, birds and mammals, hermaphroditism is almost unheard of, except for rare genetic accidents. Sexual dimorphism must convey some huge mysterious advantage. We are stuck with each other.

Party on.

	Transforming the Alchemists


Historians of science are taking a new and lively interest in alchemy, the often mystical investigation into the hidden mysteries of nature that reached its heyday in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries and has been an embarrassment to modern scientists ever since.

There was no place in the annals of empirical science, beginning mainly in the 18th century, for the occult practices of obsessed dreamers who sought most famously and impossibly to transform base metals into pure gold. So alchemy fell into disrepute.

But in the revival of scholarship on the field, historians are finding reasons to give at least some alchemists their due. Even though they were secretive and self-deluded and their practices closer to magic than modern scientific methods, historians say, alchemists contributed to the emergence of modern chemistry as a science and an agent of commerce.

''Experimentalism was one of alchemy's hallmarks,'' said Lawrence M. Principe, a historian of science at Johns Hopkins University and a trained chemist. ''You have to get your hands dirty, and in this way alchemists forged some early ideas about matter.''

Bent over boiling crucibles in their shadowy laboratories, squeezing bellows before transformative flames and poring over obscure formulas, some alchemists stumbled on techniques and reactions of great value to later chemists. It was experimentation by trial and error, historians say, but it led to new chemicals and healing elixirs and laid the foundations of procedures like separating and refining, distilling and fermenting.

''What do chemists do? They like to make stuff,'' Dr. Principe said. ''Most chemists are interested not so much in theory as in making substances with particular properties. The emphasis on products was the same with some alchemists in the 17th century.''

Pamela H. Smith, a history professor at Columbia, said alchemy ''was the matter theory of its day'' and was ''incredibly multilayered and therefore a powerful way of viewing nature.''

Yet on the whole, historians say, the widespread practice of alchemy impeded the rise of modern chemistry. While physics and astronomy marched slowly but inexorably from Galileo to Kepler to Newton and the Scientific Revolution, chemistry slumbered under alchemy's influence through what historians call its ''postponed scientific revolution.''

The new research and revised interpretations concerning the role of alchemy in the history of chemistry as well as pharmacology and medicine were discussed at a three-day conference late last month at the Chemical Heritage Foundation in Philadelphia. The meeting, attended by more than 80 scientists and historians, was organized by Dr. Principe, who said, ''Only in the last 15 or 20 years have we learned how crucial alchemy was to the emergence of modern science.''

No one at the meeting tried to turn lead into gold. But the historians conjured up quite a lode of pyrite, fool's gold, in the colorful characters they had found buried in previously neglected archives.

A few practicing alchemists, it seems, may have been certifiably mad -- probably, like mad hatters, from sniffing the mercury they worked with.

One notable alchemist of the 16th century, a Swiss named Paracelsus, was not mad, but cantankerous and iconoclastic. ''He was equal parts metallurgist, pharmacist, physician and crackpot,'' Dr. Principe said.

Historians have found that Paracelsus made some advances in the detection of disorders by analyzing urine and claimed marvelous cures through alchemy.

In his chemical cosmology, he saw the world as a great distillation vessel and its changes as parallel to the operations carried out in a laboratory. But he recorded his material and spiritual ideas in the deliberately opaque writing typical of many alchemists, who expressed themselves in codes, symbols and emblems to conceal their findings from the uninitiated.

From his study, Dane Thor Daniel of Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, concluded that Paracelsus's unwavering objective was to find a Christian alternative to pagan natural philosophy -- science.

Other alchemists were outright charlatans or fools, ridiculed in contemporary art and literature. On display in a gallery at the conference hall were several 17th-century paintings by Flemish and Dutch artists, who depicted alchemists toiling in the disorder of dark workshops and the poverty of futile quests. The paintings were said to be popular among Dutch burghers as a caution to anyone contemplating a life in alchemy instead of steady trade.

But many an alchemist drew support from royal courts where visions of newfound wealth and power danced in crowned heads. It was not always a happy alliance.

In 1601, Hans Heinrich Nüschler signed a contract with his patron, Duke Friedrich of Württemberg in Stuttgart, to demonstrate his process for extracting a substantial amount of gold from a sample of silver. The duke, keen on mining technology, promised a generous reward. Nüschler agreed to conduct the experiments at his own expense.

After several months of failure and mounting debt, the desperate alchemist resorted to fraud. He asked his brother to help by surreptitiously adding gold to the alchemical sample. His ploy exposed, Nüschler was tried, convicted and hanged.

''Only a handful of alchemists actually ended their careers on the gallows,'' said Tara E. Nummedal, a historian at Brown. ''But this underscored that alchemy was very serious business in the Holy Roman Empire.''

In her report, Dr. Nummedal concluded that the relationships of patrons and alchemists showed that ''alchemy was a direct engagement with the political, economic, religious and intellectual realities of the early modern world.''

At the turn of the 17th century, King Henry IV of France surrounded himself with alchemists who sought to resurrect plants from their ashes and experimented with ways to extend the monarch's life. Even the diplomats had orders to seek out the cryptic methods of alchemists in other countries.

An alchemist in the court of a German prince scored a profitable success quite by accident. Looking for materials for creating precious metals, Johann Friedrich Böttger analyzed a ''white earth'' that duplicated the ingredients for imported Chinese porcelain. The discovery was the beginning of the Dresden china industry.

Even geniuses of the first order, like Isaac Newton, found alchemy irresistible. It was an accepted method of seeking knowledge -- or confirmation of received truth -- in early modern history.

Newton, whose laws of gravity and optics ushered in modern physics, also delved into alchemy with relentless energy. His notebooks contain thousands of pages on alchemic thoughts and experiments over 30 years.

William R. Newman, a professor of the history and philosophy of science at Indiana University, said many manuscripts had not received the scrutiny they deserved. He reported on a text in the Smithsonian Institution that he called ''an overlooked gem.''

In these notebook entries, Newton cited the ideas of German alchemists for imitating the processes by which metals were generated in nature, deep inside the earth. These involved the familiar alchemical theory of metallic generation through interactions of sulfur and mercury.

But Newton, expanding on the theory, wrote: ''These two spirits above all wander over the earth and bestow life on animals and vegetables. And they makes stones, salts and so forth.''

As Dr. Newman noted, ''Thus we have passed from a theory of mere metallic generation to one that is intended to explain the totality of life on earth, as well as the production of all mineral materials, not just metallic ones.''

In this sense, Dr. Newman continued, Newton's repeated experiments for the rest of his life were aimed at fulfilling the words of the Emerald Tablet of Hermes, considered the founding text of alchemy in ancient Egypt. Newton expected to achieve what the tablet said was the una res, ''the one thing'' by which ''the world was created'' and with which one could ''perform miracles.''

So it seems that Newton was no ordinary alchemist interested in making gold. He apparently aspired to a theory of alchemy more comprehensive than even his laws of gravity. But it could be said, in a paraphrase of Newton's famous expression of modesty, that the giants on whose shoulders he stood in this endeavor did not measure up to his antecedents in physics and astronomy.

Newton's alchemical bent was not out of character, Dr. Smith of Columbia said. ''He was drawn to the occult,'' she said. ''Gravity for him was an occult force, and so was alchemy as an explanation of how things transform into other things.''

The British chemist Robert Boyle, a Newton contemporary, also had a foot on each side of the alchemy-modern science divide. He dabbled for years in an alchemical obsession, the search for the philosopher's stone -- the long-sought agent for transmuting lead to gold and unlocking other material and spiritual secrets. The stone was the unified theory of everything in that time.

Boyle wrote enviously in 1680 that ''there exists conceal'd in the world'' a group of chemists ''of a much higher order able to transmute baser Metalls into perfect ones.''

At the same time, Boyle hurled harsh criticism at alchemists, particularly Paracelsians and the obscurity of their language and concepts. His purpose, he wrote, was to draw ''the Chymists Doctrine out of their Dark and Smoakie Laboratories into open light'' and to engage in ''better Experiments and Arguments.''

Citing Boyle's ''swinging critique'' and even earlier attacks on alchemical practices, Stephen Clucas, a University of London historian, raised questions that he said require deeper research by historians: Why did a ''scientific revolution'' in experimental chemistry not occur earlier in the 17th century? Why was a clear separation of alchemy and exact chemistry delayed until the 18th century?

Bruce T. Moran, a historian at the University of Nevada at Reno and the University College London, said it was not all that unreasonable at the time to be attracted to alchemy. ''For a variety of practical and intellectual reasons,'' Professor Moran said, ''the idea of transforming one thing into another was to be expected.''

In everyday life, grapes were turned to wine and wheat to bread. A sour green apple grew into a sweet red one. It was in the nature of things to change, even metals. Miners and refiners already knew that lead ore almost always contains some silver, and silver ore almost always contains some gold. This implied that the metals changed one into the other over time.

In the booklet ''Transmutations: Alchemy in Art,'' written with Lloyd DeWitt, an art historian, Dr. Principe noted that in 1600, chemists knew of just seven metals -- gold, silver, iron, copper, tin, lead and mercury. (Since then scientists have discovered another 60.) The original seven known metals had properties in common. They were shiny and, except for the liquid mercury, could be hammered, shaped and cast.

''The commonality of properties implied to early thinkers a commonality of composition,'' Dr. Principe wrote., ''And thus it was theorized that all the metals were composed of the same essential ingredients in different proportions and degrees of purity.''

''Even if in the modern view alchemy is all nonsense or very spiritual,'' Dr. Moran said, ''many people drawn to it for whatever reasons were actually creating very useful, practical chemistry and bringing to it an artisan know-how.''

The conference on the history of alchemy opened with a program of chamber music called ''The Philosophers' Tone.'' The scholars delighted in Handel's transmutation of Ben Jonson's ''The Alchemist'' into pure gold. Over coffee between sessions, they pondered new directions of research and topics for dissertations. They said, for example, that more attention should be paid to alchemy's role in the history of medicine.

They also remarked, somewhat conspiratorially, over parallels between the misguided certainties and self-delusion of alchemy and today's political and religious attacks on modern science. Of Boyle's efforts to replicate experiments from alchemical writings, Joseph E. Early, a retired Georgetown University professor who studies the philosophy of chemistry, said, ''He couldn't do it any more than we could find the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.''

Then the scholars departed Philadelphia, leaving the city's lead-to-gold ratio unchanged.

	The Web as Dictator Of Scientific Fashion


If the endlessly accelerating pace of scientific research is riding the telecommunications revolution, then why did  physicists, historians and philosophers meet here recently at an isolated lodge where cell phones generally do not work and many of the rooms have no phones at all, let alone speedy Internet connections?

The answer is that a few scientists -- including some of those who attended the annual Seven Pines Symposium here -- are now saying what would have sounded not only retrograde but also deeply uncool just a few years ago: The World Wide Web and cheap satellite communications have brought trouble as well as opportunity to the scientific enterprise.

For starters, instead of fostering many independent approaches to cracking each difficult problem, the Web, by offering scientists a place to  post their new results immediately, can create a global bandwagon in which once-isolated scientists rush to become part of the latest trend.

In the resulting stampede, all but a few promising avenues are quickly abandoned. The pressure to conform can be especially intense for young scientists, who may find prospective employers trying to stock their ranks with specialists in fashionable areas.

Some scientists say the idiosyncratic, brow-furrowing, brooding kind of research that has often produced answers to basic questions is the most threatened.

''The problems fundamental physics is facing right now very much require stepping back, sitting down and taking off the shoes and talking by the fire,'' said Prof. Carlo Rovelli, a physicist from the University of Marseille in France who was at the symposium, which was designed for just this kind of leisurely reflection.

The pervasiveness of the Internet, he said, does increase the technical sophistication of that search for basic laws as new methods are rapidly passed around. ''But it raises the level of background noise,'' Professor Rovelli said. ''Discussions, 'Are we going in the right direction,' are much lower.''

Another Seven Pines participant, Prof. Jeffrey Harvey, a physicist at the University of Chicago, said that ''scorekeeping'' Web sites, which automatically track the number of times a paper is cited by others, create another kind of social pressure against marching to a different drummer. ''I think something has been lost,'' he said.

Exactly what has been lost may have been identified by Sir Roger Penrose, a physicist at Oxford University, when he spoke last week at a separate conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

''Fashionable ideas sometimes have a much greater hold on modern science than they did before communication was so easy,'' Sir Roger said. He added that changes should be made ''in a way that increases the chances of having more variety.''

Though not specifically intended to counter the Internet, the Seven Pines Symposium, which began five years ago, was designed to fill a niche that neither electronic communications nor garden-variety scientific meetings were filling, said Prof. Roger Stuewer, a historian of science at the University of Minnesota and one of the symposium's organizers.

The symposium was created and financed by Lee Gohlike, a Minnesota entrepreneur with a taste for philosophy and physics who attends the scientific presentations, spends hours conversing with participants and owns the lodge where the symposium is held. Seven Pines generally focuses on the big questions of science rather than technical minutiae.

This year, for example, the theme was the frustrating attempt to bring  together quantum theory and gravity, as embodied in relativity theory. Though there were a few major talks each day, they were followed by lengthy discussion periods, long breaks and leisurely meals during which the scientists, historians and philosophers were expected to engage each other intellectually while enjoying themselves around the lodge and its extensive grounds.

With the midwifery of the philosophers and historians, unusual exchanges did take place, especially between two competing factions within the physics community, the string theorists and the relativists, who are attempting that unification of physics.

''I was surprised how well the group did manage to communicate,'' said Prof. John Earman, who is in the history and philosophy of science department at the University of Pittsburgh. ''I didn't get the sense that either of them is going to be deflected from their chosen research program, but I did get a sense that each did get a better understanding of what the others are doing.''

In some ways the approach harks back to the way science has been done throughout most of its history.

From the Greek philosopher-scientists to Galileo, Copernicus, Newton and even many 19th-century scientists like Michael Faraday, who discovered laws governing electricity and magnetism, great advances have often emerged from relative isolation or communications with just a few trusted colleagues, said Prof. Noel Swerdlow, a science historian in the astronomy and astrophysics department at the University of Chicago. ''We're so used to thinking of community that we've lost sight of the complete isolation in which these guys were working,'' Professor Swerdlow said.

At one extreme, he said, when Ptolemy, the second-century astronomer, wrote up his work, he found it necessary to include just one ''citation'': of Hipparchus, a Greek astronomer who had lived three centuries earlier. All of that began to change rapidly with the rise of scientific journals in the 17th century, Professor Swerdlow said.

By the 20th century the tempo of scientific communication had increased considerably, but the benefits of at least sporadic isolation were still apparent in some of the great work by Einstein himself, said Prof. John Norton of the history and philosophy of science department at the University of Pittsburgh. ''Isolation was important for Einstein,'' Professor Norton said.

As recently as the early 1970's, said Prof. Rafael Sorkin, a physicist at Syracuse University, the lack of communication between the Soviet Union and the West paid big scientific dividends when an approach to particle physics called field theory was largely abandoned by United States scientists in favor of an approach they found more promising.

Not long after, Professor Sorkin said, field theory turned out to be the correct approach, and its revival was spurred partly by the Soviet work. Quantum field theory dominates particle physics today.

Professor Sorkin is not sure how to preserve some of those benefits in the age of the Internet, although he suggests that perhaps scientists could somehow agree to work in ''relatively disconnected groups'' -- which, considering the professional stakes involved, could be as difficult a proposition as asking investors not to read the stock ticker.

For all their worries about the Web, in fact, participants have no intention of giving it up. During his own talk, Dr. Norton unveiled a new electronic archive for philosophers of science (philsci-archive.pitt.edu), that emulates similar services invented by physicists.

According to its Web site, the archive's goal is to ''promote communication in the field by the rapid dissemination of new work.''

	Going at the Changes In, Ya Know, English


On Dec. 8, 1941, the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Representative Charles A. Eaton, Republican of New Jersey, made his case in the House for why the nation should enter the Second World War.

''Mr. Speaker,'' his speech began, ''yesterday against the roar of Japanese cannon in Hawaii our American people heard a trumpet call; a call to unity; a call to courage; a call to determination once and for all to wipe off of the earth this accursed monster of tyranny and slavery which is casting its black shadow over the hearts and homes of every land.''

Last year, Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, made the case for war in Iraq this way:

''And if we don't go at Iraq, that our effort in the war on terrorism dwindles down into an intelligence operation,'' he said. ''We go at Iraq and it says to countries that support terrorists, there remain six in the world that are as our definition state sponsors of terrorists, you say to those countries: we are serious about terrorism, we're serious about you not supporting terrorism on your own soil.''

The linguist and cultural critic John McWhorter cites these excerpts in his new book, ''Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We Should, Like, Care'' (Gotham Books). They not only are typical of speeches made in Congress on both occasions, he argues, but also provide a vivid illustration of just how much the language of public discourse has deteriorated.

Riddled with sentence fragments, run-ons and colloquialisms like ''go at,'' Senator Brownback's speech is still intelligible, but in Mr. McWhorter's view, it is emblematic of a creeping casualness that is largely to the nation's detriment.

''We in America now are an anomaly,'' Mr. McWhorter said over lunch at a restaurant in Midtown Manhattan this week. ''We have very little sense of English as something to be dressed up. It's just this thing that comes out of our mouths. We just talk.''

Mr. McWhorter, 38, a professor of linguistics at the University of California at Berkeley and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a policy research group in New York City, is hardly the first to complain about Americans' brazen disregard for their native tongue. But unlike many others, he says the problem is not an epidemic of bad grammar.

As a linguist, he says, he knows that grammatical rules are arbitrary and that in casual conversation people have never abided by them. Rather, he argues, the fault lies with the collapse of the distinction between the written and the oral. Where formal, well-honed English was once de rigueur in public life, he argues, it has all but disappeared, supplanted by the indifferent cadences of speech and ultimately impairing our ability to think.

This bleak assessment notwithstanding, Mr. McWhorter, an intense, confident and -- perhaps not surprisingly -- loquacious man, is not a curmudgeon or a fuddy-duddy. Nor, for that matter, a nerd, despite a résumé that bristles with intellectual precociousness.

Self-taught in 12 languages -- including Russian, Swedish, Swahili, Arabic and Hebrew, which he initially took up as a Philadelphia preschooler when he was 4 -- he is a respected expert in Creole languages. (In his spare time, he is compiling the first written grammar of Saramaccan, a Creole language spoken by descendants of former slaves in Suriname.)

A college graduate at 19 and a tenured professor at 33, he has published seven previous books, including the controversial best seller, ''Losing the Race: Self-Sabotage in Black America'' (The Free Press, 2000), in which he accused middle-class blacks of embracing anti-intellectualism and a cult of victimology. An African-American who is an outspoken critic of affirmative action, welfare and reparations, he has aroused the ire of many liberals and earned a reputation as a conservative.

But none of these exploits, he is at pains to show, should be taken to mean that he is not hip. His conversation is peppered with knowing allusions to pop culture -- Britney Spears, Tori Amos, television sitcoms, rap and Broadway. (''I'm the world's only straight musical-theater cast-album fanatic,'' he joked.) An experienced bass-baritone who plays cocktail piano and has performed in amateur theatrics, he illustrated a point about contemporary English usage by singing two lines from Stephen Sondheim's new musical, ''Bounce.'' In many ways, he insists, he is a typical product of America after the 1960's, the decade to which he dates the beginning of the nation's linguistic decline.

''I cannot recite a single poem,'' he said. ''You can take a Russian teenager and say recite some poetry, and they will give you strophes of Pushkin. We can't do it. The only equivalent for an American under a certain age is literally Dr. Seuss or theme songs.''

Until the 1960's, he maintains, informal cultural expression -- like the experimental prose of Beatnik writers -- was relegated to outsider status. But by the end of the decade, he insists, that had changed: the counterculture went mainstream, ushering in the laid-back new linguistic regime.

Over lunch, he ticked off the evidence: the Beatles and other rock 'n' roll bands became national obsessions; ''Bell Telephone Hour,'' a prime-time television show featuring classical music, was canceled; Hollywood began to make movies like ''Easy Rider'' that captured the mumbling diction of everyday speech; participants at a Dartmouth College education conference declared that creative classroom learning should be streseed over grammar rules and formal essays.

At the same time, Mr. McWhorter argued, the Free Speech Movement was spreading on college campuses -- along with expletive-laden posters, sit-ins and skimpy clothes. And black English, a language traditionally spoken, not written, was becoming increasingly popular among young people.

''During a counterculture era, when we've been taught not to trust anyone over 30 and that our leaders are corrupt, naturally the speech of the oppressed becomes more attractive,'' he said. ''It's in this era that most pop music begins to be sung in a black accent even by white people who grew up in Connecticut.''

Mr. McWhorter paints an elaborate picture of a culture in linguistic upheaval, but some scholars caution against singling out the 1960's as a time of unprecedented change.

''There has always been pop culture, or low culture, alongside the high,'' said Robin Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at the University of California at Berkeley who studies the effects of language on shaping social attitudes. ''But because low culture has traditionally been nonliterate and unattended to by the higher punditry, it tends to vanish without much of a trace. So people like John compare an imaginary golden age of only high culture products with what we have today, when low culture's products exist for posterity on tape.''

She might have cited Mr. McWhorter's book as an example of low and high culture co-existing side by side. Despite its high-minded content, it is written in a breezy, colloquial style that seems paradoxically to embody some of the linguistic traits that he deplores. Sentences like ''Back in the day, rhetoric was how we sang our language to the skies'' and ''Linguistically, America eats with its face now'' are common along with conversational locutions like ''however that rubs you'' or ''the times were a-changin'.''

The book's free-wheeling prose and unorthodox usage -- Mr. McWhorter frequently combines a plural subject with a singular verb -- has put off at least one critic, Jonathan Yardley in The Washington Post, who ended his review with the words: ''Physician, heal thyself.''

Yet Mr. McWhorter, who defends his writing style in the book, says it was a deliberate choice on his part. ''I wrote the book in a style that channels speech in a way I certainly could not have gotten away with 40 years ago,'' he admitted. In part, he said, his goal was not to sound like a scold. But his prose is also, he insisted, a reflection of the era in which he was brought up.

''I'm very much a part of this,'' he said.

	The Nation: Parts of Speech; The Bloody Crossroads of Grammar and Politics


IS there a grammatical error in the following sentence? ''Toni Morrison's genius enables her to create novels that arise from and express the injustices African Americans have endured.''

The answer is no, according to the Educational Testing Service, which included the item on the preliminary College Board exams given on Oct. 15 of last year. But Kevin Keegan, a high-school journalism teacher from Silver Spring, Md., protested that a number of grammar books assert that it is incorrect to use a pronoun with a possessive antecedent like ''Tony Morrison's'' -- that is, unless the pronoun is itself a possessive, as in ''Toni Morrison's fans adore her books.''

After months of exchanges with the tenacious Mr. Keegan, the College Board finally agreed to adjust the scores of students who had marked the underlined pronoun ''her'' as incorrect.

That's only fair. When you're asking students to pick out errors of grammar, you ought to make sure you haven't included anything that might bring the grammarati out of the woodwork.

But some read the test item as the token of a wider malaise. ''Talk about standards,'' wrote David Skinner, a columnist at the conservative Weekly Standard. Not only had the example sentence been ''proven to contain an error of grammar,'' but the sentence's celebration of Ms. Morrison, a ''mediocre contemporary author,'' betrayed the ''faddish, racialist, wishful thinking that our educational institutions should be guarding against.''

It was revealing how easily Mr. Skinner's indignation encompassed both the grammatical and cultural implications of the sentence. In recent decades, the defense of usage standards has become a flagship issue for the cultural right: the people who are most vociferous about grammatical correctness tend to be those most dismissive of the political variety. Along the way, though, grammatical correctness itself is becoming a strangely arbitrary notion.

Take the rule about pronouns and possessives that Mr. Keegan cited in his challenge to the testing service. Unlike the hoary shibboleths about the split infinitive or beginning sentences with ''but,'' this one is a relative newcomer, which seems to have surfaced in grammar books only in the 1960's. Wilson Follett endorsed it in his 1966 Modern American Usage, and it was then picked up by a number of other usage writers, including Jacques Barzun and John Simon.

The assumption behind the rule is that a pronoun has to be of the same part of speech as its antecedent. Since possessives are adjectives, the reasoning goes, they can't be followed by pronouns, even if the resulting sentence is perfectly clear.

If you accept that logic, you'll eschew sentences like ''Napoleon's fame preceded him'' (rewrite as ''His fame preceded Napoleon''). In fact you'll have to take a red pencil to just about all of the great works of English literature, starting with Shakespeare and the King James Bible (''And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison''). The construction shows up in Dickens and Thackeray, not to mention H. W. Fowler's ''Modern English Usage'' and Strunk and White's ''Elements of Style.'' (''The writer's colleagues . . . have greatly helped him in the preparation of his manuscript.'') And it's pervasive not just in The New York Times and The New Yorker, but in the pages of The Weekly Standard, not excluding Mr. Skinner's own column. (''It may be Bush's utter lack of self-doubt that his detractors hate most about him.'')

The ubiquity of those examples ought to put us on our guard -- maybe the English language knows something that the usage writers don't. In fact the rule in question is a perfect example of muddy grammatical thinking. For one thing, possessives like ''Mary's'' aren't adjectives; they're what linguists call determiner phrases. (If you doubt that, try substituting ''Mary's'' for the adjective ''happy'' in sentences like ''The child looks happy'' or ''We saw only healthy and happy children.'')

And if a nonpossessive pronoun can't have a possessive antecedent, logic should dictate that things can't work the other way around, either -- if you're going to throw out ''Hamlet's mother loved him,'' then why accept ''Hamlet loved his mother''? That's an awful lot to throw over the side in the name of consistency.

But that's what ''correct grammar'' often comes down to nowadays. It has been taken over by cultists who learned everything they needed to know about grammar in ninth grade, and who have turned the enterprise into an insider's game of gotcha! For those purposes, the more obscure and unintuitive the rule, the better.

Pity the poor writer who comes at grammar armed only with common sense and a knowledge of what English writers have done in the past -- they're liable to be busted for violating ordinances they couldn't possibly have been aware of.

Not all modern usage writers take doctrinaire views of grammar, whatever their politics. But the politicization of usage contributes to its trivialization, and tends to vitiate it as an exercise in intellectual discrimination. The more vehemently people insist on upholding standards in general, the less need there is to justify them in the particular. For many, usage standards boil down to the unquestioned truths of ''traditional grammar,'' even if some of the traditions turn out to be only a few decades old.

Take the way Mr. Skinner asserted that the College Board examination sentence was ''proven to contain an error of grammar'' in the way you might talk about a document being proven to be a forgery -- it's as if the rules of grammar were mysterious dicta handed down from long-forgotten sages.

The English conservative writer Roger Scruton has described the controversies over usage as merely a special case of the debate between conservative and liberal views of politics. But until 50 years ago, nobody talked about ''conservative'' and ''liberal'' positions on usage, and usage writers were drawn from both sides of the aisle.

Even today, it would be silly to claim that conservatives actually care more deeply about usage standards than liberals do, much less that they write more clearly or correctly. In language as elsewhere, it isn't as if vices are less prevalent among the people who denounce them most energetically.

But people who have reservations about the program of the cultural right often find themselves in an uneasy position when the discussion turns to usage. How do you defend the distinction between ''disinterested'' and ''uninterested'' without suggesting that its disappearance is a harbinger of the decline of the West?

Not that the cultural left is blameless in this. Some of the usage reforms they championed have been widely adopted, and society is the better for it. There aren't a lot of male executives around who still refer to their secretaries as ''my girl.''

But many of the locutions and usage rules that have recently been proposed in the name of social justice are as much insider codes as the arcane strictures of the grammar cultists. They're exercises in moral fastidiousness that no one really expects will catch on generally.

To younger writers, today's discussions of usage often may seem to be less about winning consensus than about winning, or scoring, points. It's no wonder they tend to regard the whole business with a weary indifference. What-ever -- will this be on the test?

	DNA of Deadbeat Voles May Hint at Why Some Fathers Turn Out to Be Rats


Some male prairie voles are devoted fathers and faithful partners, while others are less satisfactory on both counts. The spectrum of behavior is shaped by a genetic mechanism that allows for quick evolutionary changes, two researchers from Emory University report in today's issue of Science.

The mechanism depends on a highly variable section of DNA involved in controlling a gene. The Emory researchers who found it, Elizabeth A.D. Hammock and Larry J. Young, say they have detected the same mechanism embedded in the sequence of human DNA but do not yet know how it may influence people's behavior.

Voles, not to be confused with the burrowing, hill-making mole, are mouselike rodents with darker coats and fatter tails. The control section of their DNA expands and contracts in the course of evolution so that members of a wild population of voles, the Emory researchers have found, will carry sections of many different lengths. Male voles with a long version of the control section are monogamous and devoted to their pups, whereas those with shorter versions are less so.

People have the same variability in their DNA, with a control section that comes in at least 17 lengths detected so far, Dr. Young said.

So should women seek men with the longest possible DNA control region in the hope that, like the researchers' voles, they will display ''increased probability of preferences for a familiar-partner female over a novel-stranger female''?

Dr. Young said he expected that any such genetic effect in men would be influenced by culture, and thus hard to predict on an individual basis.

The control mechanism is also present in humans' two closest cousins, the chimpanzee and the bonobo, and bears on a controversy as to which of the two species humans more closely resemble.

Chimpanzees operate territorially based societies controlled by males who conduct often-lethal raids on neighboring groups. Bonobos, which look much like chimps, are governed by female hierarchies and facilitate almost every social interaction with copious sex.

The DNA sequence of humans, chimps and bonobos is generally very similar, but in the section that controls response to the hormone vasopressin, the Emory researchers have found the human and bonobo versions differ significantly from that of the chimp. Though not too much can be deduced from a single gene, the result shows that bonobos should be taken very seriously as a guide to human behavior and that the chimp is not the only model, said Dr. Frans de Waal of the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta.

Dr. de Waal, who is writing a book, ''The Inner Ape,'' said the last common ancestor of all three species presumably possessed the elements of both chimp and bonobo behavior, and that humans also ''unite all these aspects.''

The effects of vasopressin on the behavior of the three higher primates is not well understood, but has been studied in voles for many years. The hormone, generated by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain, makes male prairie voles form monogamous pair bonds, but has no similar effect in the determinedly polygamous montane vole.

The Emory researchers recently noticed that in their prairie vole colony, some fathers spent more time with their pups and some less. They traced the source of this variability to its molecular roots, a variation in the length of the DNA region that controls a certain gene.

This is the gene for the vasopressin receptor, the device used by neurons to respond to vasopressin. Voles with long and short DNA segments had different patterns of vasopressin receptors in their brains, which presumably changed their response to the hormone.

The long and short DNA segments differ by only 19 DNA units, mostly the same two units repeated over and over. The repeats are notorious for confusing the DNA copying apparatus, which every few generations or so may insert an extra repeat or delete one. The random changes have generated a spectrum of lengths in the voles that in turn underlies the variability in behavior, the Emory researchers say.

They proved the point by separating voles with the shortest length and longest length of DNA and showing that their progeny differed in behavior.

Dr. Young said he suspected that many other genes that influenced behavior, in voles and other species, might have fallen under similar control systems. Because the DNA repeats are so variable, they generate diversity more quickly than most other types of mutation. And a population whose individuals show a range of behavior is more likely to include some who can better adapt to a new situation.

Dr. Gene Robinson, an expert in social behavior at the University of Illinois, said the new finding was ''a significant advance in sociogenomics,'' the attempt to explain social life in terms of DNA, because it showed how easily behavior could be changed just by altering a gene's activity, not the gene itself.

For a long time, researchers have assumed the genetic control of behavior would be too complex a problem to address. ''The nice thing about this story is that it tells you it's not complex,'' Dr. Young said.

	Is War Our Biological Destiny?


In these days of hidebound militarism and round-robin carnage, when even that beloved ambassador of peace, the Dalai Lama, says it may be necessary to counter terrorism with violence, it's fair to ask: Is humanity doomed? Are we born for the battlefield -- congenitally, hormonally incapable of putting war behind us? Is there no alternative to the bullet-riddled trapdoor, short of mass sedation or a Marshall Plan for our DNA?

Was Plato right that ''Only the dead have seen the end of war''?

In the heartening if admittedly provisional opinion of a number of researchers who study warfare, aggression, and the evolutionary roots of conflict, the great philosopher was, for once, whistling in a cave. As they see it, blood lust and the desire to wage war are by no means innate. To the contrary, recent studies in the field of game theory show just how readily human beings establish cooperative networks with one another, and how quickly a cooperative strategy reaches a point of so-called fixation. Researchers argue that one need not be a Pollyanna, or even an aging hippie, to imagine a human future in which war is rare and universally condemned.

They point out that slavery was long an accepted fact of life; if your side lost the battle, tough break, the wife and kids were shipped off as slaves to the victors. Now, when cases of slavery arise in the news, they are considered perverse and unseemly.

The incentive to make war similarly anachronistic is enormous, say the researchers, though they worry that it may take the dropping of another nuclear bomb in the middle of a battlefield before everybody gets the message. ''I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought,'' Albert Einstein said, ''but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.''

Admittedly, war making will be a hard habit to shake. ''There have been very few times in the history of civilization when there hasn't been a war going on somewhere,'' said Victor Davis Hanson, a military historian and classicist at California State University in Fresno. He cites a brief period between A.D. 100 and A.D. 200 as perhaps the only time of world peace, the result of the Roman Empire's having everyone, fleetingly, in its thrall.

Archaeologists and anthropologists have found evidence of militarism in perhaps 95 percent of the cultures they have examined or unearthed. Time and again groups initially lauded as gentle and peace-loving -- the Mayas, the !Kung of the Kalahari, Margaret Mead's Samoans, -- eventually were outed as being no less bestial than the rest of us. A few isolated cultures have managed to avoid war for long stretches. The ancient Minoans, for example, who populated Crete and the surrounding Aegean Islands, went 1,500 years battle-free; it didn't hurt that they had a strong navy to deter would-be conquerors.

Warriors have often been the most esteemed of their group, the most coveted mates. And if they weren't loved for themselves, their spears were good courtship accessories. This year, geneticists found evidence that Genghis Khan, the 13th century Mongol emperor, fathered so many offspring as he slashed through Asia that 16 million men, or half a percent of the world's male population, could be his descendants.

Wars are romanticized, subjects of an endless, cross-temporal, transcultural spool of poems, songs, plays, paintings, novels, films. The battlefield is mythologized as the furnace in which character and nobility are forged; and, oh, what a thrill it can be. ''The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction,'' writes Chris Hedges, a reporter for The New York Times who has covered wars, in ''War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning.'' Even with its destruction and carnage, he adds, war ''can give us what we long for in life.''

''It can give us purpose, meaning, a reason for living,'' he continues.

Nor are humans the only great apes to indulge in the elixir. Common chimpanzees, which share about 98 percent of their genes with humans, also wage war: gangs of neighboring males meet at the borderline of their territories with the express purpose of exterminating their opponents. So many males are lost to battle that the sex ratio among adult chimpanzees is two females for every male.

And yet there are other drugs on the market, other behaviors to sate the savage beast. Dr. Frans de Waal, a primatologist and professor of psychology at Emory University, points out that a different species of chimpanzee, the bonobo, chooses love over war, using a tantric array of sexual acts to resolve any social problems that arise. Serious bonobo combat is rare, and the male-to-female ratio is, accordingly, 1:1. Bonobos are as closely related to humans as are common chimpanzees, so take your pick of which might offer deeper insight into the primal ''roots'' of human behavior.

Or how about hamadryas baboons? They're surly, but not silly. If you throw a peanut in front of a male, Dr. de Waal said, it will pick it up happily and eat it. Throw the same peanut in front of two male baboons, and they'll ignore it. ''They'll act as if it doesn't exist,'' he said. ''It's not worth a fight between two fully grown males.''

Even the ubiquitousness of warfare in human history doesn't impress researchers. ''When you consider it was only about 13,000 years ago that we discovered agriculture, and that most of what we're calling human history occurred since then,'' said Dr. David Sloan Wilson, a biology and anthropology professor at Binghamton University in New York, ''you see what a short amount of time we've had to work toward global peace.''

In that brief time span, the size of cooperative groups has grown steadily, and by many measures more pacific. Maybe 100 million people died in the world wars of the 20th century. Yet Dr. Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has estimated that if the proportion of casualties in the modern era were to equal that seen in many conflicts among preindustrial groups, then perhaps two billion people would have died.

Indeed, national temperaments seem capable of rapid, radical change. The Vikings slaughtered and plundered; their descendants in Sweden haven't fought a war in nearly 200 years, while the Danes reserve their fighting spirit for negotiating better vacation packages. The tribes of highland New Guinea were famous for small-scale warfare, said Dr. Peter J. Richerson, an expert in cultural evolution at the University of California at Davis. ''But when, after World War II, the Australian police patrols went around and told people they couldn't fight anymore, the New Guineans thought that was wonderful,'' Dr. Richerson said. ''They were glad to have an excuse.''

Dr. Wilson cites the results of game theory experiments: participants can adopt a cheating strategy to try to earn more for themselves, but at the risk of everybody's losing, or a cooperative strategy with all earning a smaller but more reliable reward. In laboratories around the world, researchers have found that participants implement the mutually beneficial strategy, in which cooperators are rewarded and noncooperators are punished. ''It shows in a very simple and powerful way that it's easy to get cooperation to evolve to fixation, for it to be the successful strategy,'' he said. There is no such quantifiable evidence or theoretical underpinning in favor of Man the Warrior, he added.

As Dr. de Waal and many others see it, the way to foment peace is to encourage interdependency among nations, as in the European Union. ''Imagine if France were to invade Germany now,'' he said. ''That would upset every aspect of their economic world,'' not the least one being France's reliance on the influx of German tourists. ''It's not as if Europeans all love each other,'' Dr. de Waal said. ''But you're not promoting love, you're promoting economic calculations.''

It's not just the money. Who can put a price tag on the pleasures to be had from that wholesome, venerable sport -- making fun of the tourists?

	Robert L. Forward, 70, Physicist and Novelist


Robert L. Forward, a science fiction writer, physicist and inventor whose 11 novels were inspired by his research into gravitational physics and advanced space propulsion, died at his home in Seattle last Saturday. He was 70.

The cause of death was cancer, his son-in-law, Ben Mattlin, said.

With his first book, ''Dragon's Egg'' (1980), Dr. Forward established a reputation as a creator of fantastic worlds that were solidly based on scientific principles. He set ''Dragon's Egg'' and its sequel, ''Starquake'' (1985), on a neutron star, a highly compressed remnant of an exploding star where gravity is 67 billion times stronger than Earth's. The star's inhabitants, whom he called cheelas, lived the equivalent of about 45 minutes.

In his final book, ''Saturn Rukh'' (Tor/Tom Doherty, 1997), his attention to accuracy led him to include an appendix of mathematical tables and astronomical diagrams for readers interested in verifying the maneuvers of the book's spacecraft.

He also wrote ''The Flight of the Dragonfly'' (1984), which he renamed ''Rocheworld'' and followed with four sequels.

Dr. Forward, who held a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Maryland, began his literary career while working as a senior scientist at the Hughes Aircraft Company's laboratory in Malibu, Calif. He often explained that he had advised so many science fiction writers on the technical details of space flight and other scientific issues that he decided to take up writing himself.

At Hughes and later at companies he founded, Forward Unlimited (in 1987) and Tethers Unlimited (in 1994), Dr. Forward devoted his research efforts to propulsion systems for space travel. He studied the potential for antimatter propulsion (similar to the system that powers the Starship Enterprise on ''Star Trek'') for the Air Force and NASA.

For epic interstellar journeys, he envisioned a rocketless vehicle that would be manufactured in space and equipped with an ultrathin sail as big as Texas. The ship would be propelled by a laser beam or high-energy particles shot from Earth; traveling at 55,000 miles per second, it would reach the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, in less than 50 years.

Dr. Forward applied this concept of heavenly sailing ships to a somewhat more practical purpose when he designed a satellite, called a statite, that could hover 200,000 miles above one of the poles, held in place by sails filled by solar winds. In 1993 his design won a patent, one of the 20 that he received.

Robert Lull Forward was born in Geneva, N.Y., on Aug. 15, 1932. He served in the Air Force, reaching the rank of captain. He received his bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Maryland and a master's in applied physics from the University of California at Los Angeles. For his doctorate he built and operated the world's first bar antenna for the detection of gravitational radiation, which is now at the Smithsonian Institution.

He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Martha; three daughters, Julie Fuller, of Ramona, Calif.; Mary Lois Mattlin, of Los Angeles; and Eve Forward-Rollins, of Seattle; his son, Robert, of Los Angeles; and seven grandchildren.

Dr. Forward received much praise for his science fiction novels, although it was sometimes qualified. In The New York Times Book Review in 1993, Gerald Jonas wrote that in ''Camelot 30K'' Dr. Forward wasted ''no time on frills like plot and character development.'' Still, Mr. Jonas concluded, ''he has fashioned an intellectual puzzle, pure and simple, with a wonderfully clever solution that blew my own tentative hypotheses sky-high.''

	Scientists Reach Out to Distant Worlds


Nobody knows why our early ancestors decided to get off their knuckles and stand upright. Maybe they just wanted a better view of the stars.

And when sky gazers finally realized that the heavenly lights were not the footprints of the gods, but rather millions of blazing stars like our Sun writ far, they began to wonder, How do we get there? How can we leave this world and travel, not merely the 238,000 miles to the Moon, or 35 million miles to Mars, but through the vast dark silk of interstellar space, across trillions and trillions of miles, to encounter other stars, other solar systems, even other civilizations?

According to a group of scientists for whom the term ''wildly optimistic dreamers'' is virtually a job description, it will indeed be very difficult to travel to other stars, and nobody in either the public or private sector is about to try it any time soon. But as the researchers see it, the challenge is not insurmountable, it requires no defiance of the laws of physics, so why not have fun and start thinking about it now?

At the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of  Science, held last month in Boston, scientists discussed how humans might pull off a real-life version of ''Star Trek,'' minus the space Lycra and perpetual syndication rights.

They talked about propulsion at a reasonable fraction of the speed of light, a velocity that is orders of magnitude greater than any space ship can fly today, but that would be necessary if the light-years of space between the Sun and even the nearest star are ever to be crossed.

They talked about the possibility of multigenerational space travel, and what it might be like for people who board a space ship knowing that they, their children, grandchildren and descendants through 6, 8 or 10 generations would live and die knowing nothing but life in an enclosed and entirely artificial environment, hurtling year upon year through the near-featureless expanse of interstellar space.

They talked about how big the founding crew would have to be to prevent long-term risks of inbreeding and so-called genetic drift. They talked about how the crew's chain of command would be structured, what language people would most likely speak, and what sort of marital and family policies might be put in place.

And they talked about food, all of which would have to be grown, cultivated and synthesized on board.

''One thing is almost certain,'' said Dr. Jean B. Hunter, an associate professor of biological and environmental engineering at Cornell. ''You'll have to leave the steak, cheesecake and artichokes with hollandaise sauce behind.''

Many of the subjects raised during the session were so fanciful that at times it felt like a discussion of how to clone a unicorn, and indeed half the presenters moonlight as science fiction writers.

Nevertheless, the researchers argued, human beings have shown themselves to be implacable itinerants, capable of colonizing the most hostile environments.

Dr. John H. Moore, a research professor of anthropology at the University of Florida, compared a theoretical crew of spacefaring pioneers to groups of Polynesians setting out tens of thousands of years ago in search of new islands to populate.

''Young people with food and tools would set out in large flotillas of canoes,'' he said. ''Nobody knew if they would ever come back, the trade winds went in only one direction, and many of them perished in the ocean.''

Yet over time, the Polynesians managed to colonize New Zealand, Easter Island and Hawaii.

Still, no human migration in history would compare in difficulty with reaching another star. The nearest, Alpha Centauri, is about 4.4 light-years from the Sun, and a light-year is equal to almost six trillion miles. The next nearest star, Sirius, is 8.7 light-years from home. To give a graphic sense of what these distances mean, Dr. Geoffrey A. Landis of the NASA John Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, pointed out that the fastest objects humans have ever dispatched into space are the Voyager interplanetary probes, which travel at about 9.3 miles per second.

''If a caveman had launched one of those during the last ice age, 11,000 years ago,'' Dr. Landis said, ''it would now be only a fifth of the way toward the nearest star.''

Dr. Robert L. Forward, owner and chief scientist of Forward Unlimited, a consulting company that describes itself as ''specializing in exotic physics and advanced space propulsion,'' argued that rockets and their fuel would be so heavy that they would prevent a starship from reaching the necessary velocity to go anywhere in a sane amount of time. He envisions a rocketless spacecraft that would be manufactured in space and equipped with an ultrathin, ultralarge sail, its span as big as Texas but using no more material than a small bridge. A beam of laser light or high-energy particles from a source on Earth, in space or perhaps on the Sun-drenched planet of Mercury would be aimed at the sail, propelling it and its attached module to as much as 30 percent the speed of light -- or about 55,000 miles per second.

At that pace, said Dr. Forward, a crew would reach Alpha Centauri in under 50 years.

''You could get a bunch of 16-year-olds, train them and then send them out at the age of 20,'' he said. ''They'd have a long, boring trip, reach Alpha Centauri when they're in their 60's or 70's, do some exploring, and send everything they learned back home.''

Admittedly, the astronauts would not make it home themselves. ''It's a lifetime job,'' Dr. Forward said.  ''But it could be done in a single generation.''

For longer journeys, designed with multigenerational crews in mind, an onboard engine and fuel source would be required, perhaps something powered by nuclear bombs, or the combining of matter and antimatter in a reaction that converts both substances into pure energy.

However the ship is propulsed, the researchers agree that it must be  comfortable for long-distance travel.  That means creating artificial gravity by gently rotating the craft; a spin no greater than one or two revolutions per minute would suffice.

It might also mean calling upon architects with Disney-esque sensibilities.

''The inside of one of these long-duration space habitats might feel like the inside of a shopping mall,'' Dr. Landis said. ''Malls are carefully designed to use space efficiently, yet to give you the feeling that they're more spacious than they are.''

And malls, of course, are a great place to bring the family. In Dr. Moore's view, the good old-fashioned family is the key to success in space.

''Over the past several decades, space scientists and writers of science fiction have speculated at length about the optimum size and composition'' of an interstellar crew, he said. They have imagined platoons of Chuck Yeager-type stalwarts grimly enduring all hardships, or teams of bionic and vaguely asexual crew members overseeing freezers of embryos that can be defrosted and gestated as needed.

''Some of the scenarios proposed so far are downright alarming from a social science perspective,'' Dr. Moore said, ''since they require bizarre social structures and an intensity of social relationships which are quite beyond the experience of any known human communities.''

In deciding how to organize a star mission, Dr. Moore looks to the most ''familiar, ubiquitous, well-ordered and well-understood'' of social forms, the human family. ''Virtually every human society in history has been structured along kinship lines,'' he said, ''from small-scale foraging societies to empires comprising millions of people.''

Lines of authority and seniority in a family are reasonably clear, and when they're not, well, there's always the time-out chamber.

In Dr. Moore's rendition, all recruits for an interstellar odyssey would be guaranteed the opportunity, though not the requirement, to marry and have children. Mate choice would be part of the bargain as well, with the population cannily structured so that each cohort of individuals, on reaching sexual maturity, would have about 10 potential partners of a similar age to select from.

Dr. Moore and his colleagues have developed a computer simulation called Ethnopop, in which they asked how large the crew must be in order to maintain genetic variability over time while still allowing crew members a choice of sex partners. They determined that a founding crew could be as small as 80 to 100 people and stay viable for more than a thousand years, assuming that two rules were followed: women waited  until they were in their mid-30's or so before having children, and they had only a couple each. Counterintuitive though it may seem, said Dr. Moore, delayed childbearing and small families are known to help maintain genetic variability in a closed population.

Genetic diversity may be essential, but Dr. Sarah G. Thomason, a professor of linguistics at the University of Michigan, argued that the same could not be said for language. ''You want everyone to be able to talk to each other as soon as they're on board,'' she said.

As Dr. Thomason sees it, the likeliest lingua franca for a starship will be -- gracias a Dios -- English. After all, she said, English is the language of the international air traffic control system, the scientific community and the educated class generally.  English is the official language of 51 of the 195 nations of the world, and it is the second language of many others.

Yet, while crew members will be expected to speak English, their accents are likely to be quite diverse, and the English that their children and grandchildren end up speaking will have a rhythm and texture of its own -- Space English. And though Dr. Thomason believes that the basic structure of Space English is not likely to change much from that of the mother tongue, teenagers will, of course, invent words of their own and drop words of scant use. ''I can imagine the loss of words like snow, rivers, winter, mosquitoes, if they're lucky,'' she said.

Another arena that will test the limits of human ingenuity is space  cuisine. Without livestock on board or supply ships to restock the pantry, crew members will have to be entirely self-sufficient. Dr. Hunter of Cornell envisions crops grown in hydroponic gardens, in which plants are suspended in troughs like rain gutters, and water and fertilizer are trickled slowly over their roots.  Among the possible food groups are wheat, rice, sweet potatoes, beans, soy, corn, herbs and spices.

In addition, space-minded agronomists are exploring the marvels of microbes. Plants take weeks to grow, but yeastlike micro-organisms replicating in vats can be used to churn out significant quantities of carbohydrates, sugars, proteins and fats in a matter of hours. Of benefit to a community in which recycling is not just a personal virtue but a public necessity, micro-organisms can live on the carboniferous waste products of plants and people.

''There's a protein product called quorn, which is made from filamentous mold,'' Dr. Hunter said. ''Not to make a joke of it, but it does taste like chicken.''

Some clichés, it seems, are truly universal.

Correction:  March 9, 2002, Saturday  An article in Science Times on Tuesday about the challenges of interstellar travel referred imprecisely to the stars nearest Earth's. While Alpha Centauri is the nearest star system, it has three stars; the nearest is Proxima Centauri, 4.2 light-years away. The next nearest is Barnard's star, at 6 light-years -- not the double star Sirius, 8.7 light-years away.

	Science's Elusive Realm: Life's Little Mysteries


Physicists observe the natural world and extract from it laws and principles that reliably explain everyday phenomena. At the smallest scale, they use quantum mechanics to predict the behavior of subatomic particles and small molecules. At larger scales, they devise theories to explain magnetism, the conduction of heat and electricity and other phenomena that occur the same way in a wide variety of materials.

Scientists boast that these principles predict how most matter will behave in physical and chemical experiments.

But there is one region that eludes them. That is the region containing matter on a scale of 10 to 1,000 angstroms (an angstrom being one billionth of a meter) -- bigger than a simple molecule but smaller than a living cell. This is the realm in which the constituents of cells interact with one another.

It is where proteins fold, charged ions move through cell membranes and messenger molecules read DNA instructions in the cell nucleus. Even the most advanced microscopes can only glimpse this activity, because the energies they use tend to destroy living tissue, said Dr. David Pines, a physicist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

At this level, things do not act according to well-described theories of chemistry and physics. Rather, systems this size seem to obey a unique set of rules that cannot be deduced from studying their individual components.

There are too many atoms in the systems to be described by electromagnetism and quantum theories but too few to handle statistically.

This is the realm of ''the mesoscale,'' and scientists like Dr. Pines and Dr. Robert Laughlin, the Nobel laureate from Stanford, are attacking its mysteries.

''I think we'll see some answers,  but it will take a generation or two,'' Dr. Laughlin said in a recent interview. ''It won't happen tomorrow.''

Work has begun under the auspices of the Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter or ICAM, a new and independent unit of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of California at Berkeley,  which administers the lab. Led by Dr. Pines and Dr. Laughlin, the physicists, chemists and biologists of ICAM met here this year to discuss how scientists might try to understand and maybe even design matter that organizes itself into living systems.

Unlike the Santa Fe Institute and other centers that study complexity, ICAM scientists tend to shun computer models and the jargon of complex systems. Nor do they have much faith in efforts to understand life by sequencing genes and looking for similar patterns in different organisms.

Without deeper organizing principles, they say, the mere accumulation and organization of genetic data will not shed light on how life works.

Research on the mesoscale must be based on experiments, Dr. Laughlin said. ''It's about making stuff, putting matter into new situations so you may discover something new. Then you do your best to disprove your theory. Physics teaches us that rules dreamt up without the benefit of physical insight are nearly always wrong. Correct rules must be discovered, not invented.''

As an example, he cites 19th century physicists who believed light needed some kind of medium, called ether, to spread through the universe. But this wholly fabricated invention was overturned when Albert Einstein accepted at face value experiments that found light travels at a constant speed and ''went on to make his astonishing predictions about the dilation of time and the equivalence of mass and energy, both of which have now been verified in countless experiments,'' Dr. Laughlin said.

Nanotechnology is exploring matter at the mesoscale and holds promise for discovering new principles, Dr. Laughlin said. But until it develops some theories, it will not be able to test new ideas about how living systems are organized. Mathematicians are beginning to make important contributions that help model and understand biological systems, he said, but laboratory experiments still need to guide their thinking.

To start with, ICAM researchers are focusing on one beguiling fact: complex systems can arise out of simple constituents that interact with each other in ways not necessarily obvious.

In Dr. Laughlin's view, life is constructed according to engineering principles or laws that do not change, though they are observed at different scales under different conditions, Dr. Laughlin said. For example, the laws of hydrodynamics -- the science that deals with the motions of fluids and the forces acting on solid bodies immersed in fluids -- are the same in a wide variety of materials. Do these so-called ''protected'' laws exist at the mesoscale? No one attending the ICAM meeting claimed to have the answer. But they discussed a variety of ways to find out.

One approach involves studying the way small molecules called amino acids fold themselves up to make functional proteins. When a gene directs messenger RNA to make a protein, it activates machinery that produces a linear chain of amino acids that code for the protein. Scientists used to think that the same linear sequence of amino acids always led to the same protein, said Dr. Peter Wolynes, a chemist at the University of California at San Diego. They also thought that proteins followed more or less the same course when they folded.

But now, Dr. Wolynes said, scientists know that a huge variety of amino acid sequences can fold up to form the same protein. Moreover, the same string of amino acids fol ded differently creates a protein that acts differently in the body. These findings have turned protein folding into one of the most intractable problems in biology. For example, a big protein like myoglobin, the iron-bearing pigment in muscles, can be made by any one of many millions of different amino acid sequences.

What makes a protein follow one of these many folding possibilities to achieve its functional shape? The answer, Dr. Wolynes said, lies in what he and other researchers call ''funnels'' in the multidimensional landscape of folding possibilities.  Like real funnels that force material to flow in one direction, protein funnels are produced when amino acids try many different configurations and are drawn by an interplay of positive and negative forces to flow or fold in one direction.

But the detailed physical interactions that may create these funnels are not well understood.

Dr. James Shapiro, a professor of microbiology at the University of Chicago and an ICAM researcher, said that interactions among components in a system were the keys to understanding the emergence of complex systems.

These interactions include dynamic properties like feedback and checkpoints, at which the system checks to make sure everything is all right, which are seen everywhere in living cells, he said. All kinds of signals inform cells where they are at a given time, where their neighbors are, what they are supposed to do next and how and when to stop, Dr. Shapiro said.

Feedback and control are processes that lead to protected states in the mesoscale, which need to be explored experimentally. Dr. M. Reza  Ghadiri, a chemist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego has in his laboratory created small systems of organic molecules that faithfully make copies of themselves and use feedback to change their dynamics.

These molecular ecosystems are not life, he said, but they do show emergent properties like the ability to reproduce, form parasites, correct errors and engage in symbiosis.

Dr. Laughlin challenged biologists to double-check some of their classic experiments used to explain how DNA works at a molecular level. For example, many details of accepted theories of how DNA actually makes proteins are ''appallingly bad,'' he said.

''I've just written a paper on this subject, which is considered nutty by many experts and visionary by others,'' he said. He said it would be published soon in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and added that he welcomed vigorous debate about it.

At Harvard, Dr. George Whitesides is experimenting with magnetite and iron beads to explore how forces of repulsion, attraction and energy dissipation interact to form unpredictable complex patterns. As these simple systems evolve, Dr. Whitesides said, it should be possible to explore the dynamics of interacting particles and perhaps model biological principles.

''We are letting nature tell us what it likes to do,'' he said. Such experiments have extraordinary implications, Dr. Pines said. Unlike vitalism -- a doctrine that says the processes of life are not explicable by the laws of physics and chemistry alone and that life is in some way self-determining -- the research into complex adaptive matter says that life is the consequence of molecular interactions.

''If we can discover organizing principles in biology other than evolution, it means we will be able to make living systems in the laboratory,'' Dr. Pines said. ''We can understand how life began.''

Correction:  April 25, 2001, Wednesday  An article in Science Times yesterday about a new effort to understand the behavior of matter bigger than a simple molecule but smaller than a living cell -- at the mesoscale, the scale of 10 to 1,000 angstroms -- defined an angstrom incorrectly. It is one ten-billionth of a meter, not a billionth of a meter.

	Of Mice and Elephants: a Matter of Scale


Scientists, intent on categorizing everything around them, sometimes divide themselves into the lumpers and the splitters. The lumpers, many of whom flock to the unifying field of theoretical physics, search for hidden laws uniting the most seemingly diverse phenomena: Blur your vision a little and lightning bolts and static cling are really the same thing. The splitters, often drawn to the biological sciences, are more taken with diversity, reveling in the 34,000 variations on the theme spider, or the 550 species of coniferous trees.

But there are exceptions to the rule. When two biologists and a physicist, all three of the lumper persuasion, recently joined forces at the Santa Fe Institute, an interdisciplinary research center in northern New Mexico, the result was an advance in a problem that has bothered scientists for decades: the origin of biological scaling. How is one to explain the subtle ways in which various characteristics of living creatures -- their life spans, their pulse rates, how fast they burn energy -- change according to their body size?

As animals get bigger, from tiny shrew to huge blue whale, pulse rates slow down and life spans stretch out longer, conspiring so that the number of heartbeats during an average stay on Earth tends to be roughly  the same, around a billion. A mouse just uses them up more quickly than an elephant.

Mysteriously, these and a large variety of other phenomena change with body size according to a precise mathematical principle called quarter-power scaling. A cat, 100 times more massive than a mouse, lives 100 to the one-quarter power, or about three times, longer. (To calculate this number, take the square root of 100, which is 10, and then take the square root of 10, which is 3.2.) Heartbeat scales to mass to the minus one-quarter power. A cat's heart thus beats a third as fast as a mouse's.

The Santa Fe Institute collaborators -- Dr. Geoffrey West, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and two biologists at the University of New Mexico, Dr. Jim Brown and Dr. Brian Enquist -- have drawn on their different kinds of expertise to propose a model for what causes certain kinds of quarter-power scaling, which they have extended to the plant kingdom as well.

In their theory, scaling emerges from the geometrical properties of the internal networks animals and plants use to distribute nutrients. But almost as interesting as the details of the model is the collaboration itself. It is rare enough for scientists of such different persuasions to come together, rarer still that the result is hailed as an important development.

''Scaling is interesting because, aside from natural selection, it is one of the few laws we really have in biology,'' said Dr. John Gittleman, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Virginia. ''What is so elegant is that the work makes very clear predictions about causal mechanisms. That's what had been missing in the field.''

Dr. Brown said: ''None of us could have done it by himself. It is one of the most exciting things I've been involved in.''

It might seem that because a cat is a hundred times more massive than a mouse, its metabolic rate, the intensity with which it burns energy, would be a hundred times greater -- what mathematicians call a linear relationship. After all, the cat has a hundred times more cells to feed.

But if this were so, the animal would quickly be consumed by a fit of spontaneous feline combustion, or at least a very bad fever. The reason: the surface area a creature uses to dissipate the heat of the metabolic fires does not grow as fast as its body mass. To see this, consider (like a good lumper) a mouse as an approximation of a small sphere. As the sphere grows larger, to cat size, the surface area increases along two dimensions but the volume increases along three dimensions. The size of the biological radiator cannot possibly keep up with the size of the metabolic engine.

If this was the only factor involved, metabolic rate would scale to body mass to the two-thirds power, more slowly than in a simple one-to-one relationship. The cat's metabolic rate would be not 100 times greater than the mouse's but 100 to the power of two-thirds, or about 21.5 times greater.

But biologists, beginning with Max Kleiber in the early 1930's, found that the situation was much more complex. For an amazing range of creatures, spanning in size from bacteria to blue whales, metabolic rate scales with body mass not to the two-thirds power but slightly faster -- to the three-quarter power [explanatory box, page 2]. Evolution seems to have found a way to overcome in part the limitations imposed by pure geometric scaling, the fact that surface area grows more slowly than size. For decades no one could plausibly say why.

Kleiber's law means that a cat's metabolic rate is not a hundred or 21.5 times greater than a mouse's,  but about 31.6 -- 100 to the three-quarter power. This relationship  seems to hold across the animal kingdom, from shrew to blue whale, and it has since been extended all the way down to single-celled organisms,  and possibly within the cells themselves to the internal structures  called mitochondria that turn nutrients into energy.

The Scientists  Common Simplicity Starts to Emerge

Long before meeting Dr. Brown and Dr. Enquist, Dr. West was interested in how scaling manifests itself in the world of subatomic particles. The strong nuclear force, which binds quarks into neutrons, protons and other particles, is weaker, paradoxically, when the quarks are closer  together, but stronger as they are pulled farther apart -- the opposite  of what happens with gravity or electromagnetism. Scaling also shows up in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: the more finely you measure the position of a particle, viewing it on a smaller and smaller scale, the more uncertain its momentum becomes.

''Everything around us is scale dependent,'' Dr. West said. ''It's woven into the fabric of the universe.''

The lesson he took away from this was that you cannot just naively scale things up. He liked to illustrate the idea with Superman. In two panels labeled ''A Scientific Explanation of Clark Kent's Amazing Strength,'' from Superman's first comic book adventure in 1938, the artists invoked a scaling law: ''The lowly ant can support weights hundreds of times its own. The grasshopper leaps what to man would be the space of several city blocks.'' The implication was that on the planet Krypton, Superman's home, strength scaled to body mass in a simple linear manner: If an ant could carry a twig, a Superman or Superwoman could carry a giant ponderosa pine.

But in the rest of the universe, the scaling is actually much slower. Body mass increases along three dimensions, but the strength of legs  and arms, which is proportional to their cross-sectional area, increases along just two dimensions. If a man is a million times more massive than an ant, he will be only 1,000,000 to the two-thirds power stronger: about 10,000 times, allowing him to lift objects weighing up to a hundred pounds, not thousands.

Things behave differently at different scales, but there are orderly  ways -- scaling laws -- that connect one realm to another. ''I found this enormously exciting,'' Dr. West said. ''That's what got me thinking about scaling in biology.''

At some point he ran across Kleiber's law. ''It is truly amazing because life is easily the most complex of complex systems,'' Dr. West said. ''But in spite of this, it has this absurdly simple scaling law. Something universal is going on.''

Brian Enquist became hooked on scaling as a student at Colorado College in Colorado Springs in 1988. When he was looking for a graduate school to study ecology, he chose the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque partly because a professor there, Dr. Jim Brown, specialized in how scaling occurred in ecosystems.

There are obviously very few large species, like elephants and whales,  and a countless number of small species. But who would have expected, as Dr. Enquist learned in one of Dr. Brown's classes, that if one drew a graph with the size of animals on one axis and the number of species on the other axis, the slope of the resulting line would reveal another quarter-power scaling law? Population density, the average number of offspring, the time until reproduction -- all are dependent on body size scaled to quarter-powers.

''As an ecologist you are used to dealing with complexity -- you're  essentially embedded in it,'' Dr. Enquist said. ''But all these quarter-power scaling laws hinted that something very general and simple was going on.''

The examples Dr. Brown had given all involved mammals. ''Has anyone found similar laws with plants?'' Dr. Enquist asked. Dr. Brown said: ''I have no idea. Why don't you find out?''

After sifting through piles of data compiled over the years in agricultural and forestry reports, Dr. Enquist found that the same kinds of quarter-power scaling happened in the plant world. He even uncovered  an equivalent to Kleiber's law.

It was surprising enough that these laws held among all kinds of  animals. That they seemed to apply to plants as well was astonishing.  What was the common mechanism involved? ''I asked Jim whether or not we could figure it out,'' Dr. Enquist recalled. ''He kind of rubbed his head and said, 'Do you know how long this is going to take?' ''

They assumed that Kleiber's law, and maybe the other scaling relationships, arose because of the mathematical nature of the networks both animals and trees used to transport nutrients to all their cells and carry away the wastes. A silhouette of the human circulatory system and of the roots and branches of a tree look remarkably similar. But they knew that precisely modeling the systems would require some very difficult mathematics and physics. And they wanted to talk to someone who was used to trafficking in the idea of general laws.

''Physicists tend to look for universals and invariants whereas biologists often get preoccupied with all the variations in nature,'' Dr. Brown said. He knew that the Santa Fe Institute had been established to encourage broad-ranging collaborations. He asked Mike Simmons, then an institute administrator, whether he knew of a physicist interested in  tackling biological scaling laws.

The Collaboration  Learning to Speak New Languages

Dr. West liked to joke that if Galileo had been a biologist, he would  have written volumes cataloging how objects of different shapes fall  from the Leaning Tower of Pisa at slightly different velocities. He  would not have seen through the distracting details to the underlying  truth: if you ignore air resistance, all objects fall at the same rate regardless of their weight.

But at their first meeting in Santa Fe, he was impressed that Dr. Brown  and Dr. Enquist were interested in big, all-embracing theories. And they  were impressed that Dr. West seemed like a biologist at heart. He wanted to know how life worked.

It took them a while to learn each other's languages, but before long  they were meeting every week at the Santa Fe Institute. Dr. West would  show the biologists how to translate the qualitative ideas of biology into precise equations. And Dr. Brown and Dr. Enquist would make sure Dr. West was true to the biology. Sometimes he would show up with a neat model, a physicist's dream. No, Dr. Brown and Dr. Enquist would tell him, real organisms do not work that way.

''When collaborating across that wide a gulf of disciplines, you're never going to learn everything the collaborator knows,'' Dr. Brown said. ''You have to develop an implicit trust in the quality of their science. On the other hand, you learn enough to be sure there are not miscommunications.''

They started by assuming that the nutrient supply networks in both animals and plants worked according to three basic principles: the networks  branched to reach every part of the organism and the ends of the  branches (the capillaries and their botanical equivalent) were all about  the same size. After all, whatever the species, the sizes of cells being fed were all roughly equivalent. Finally, they assumed that evolution would  have tuned the systems to work in the most efficient possible manner.

What emerged closely approximated a so-called fractal network, in which each tiny part is a replica of the whole. Magnify the network of blood vessels in a hand and the image resembles one of an entire circulatory system. And to be as efficient as possible, the network also had to be ''area-preserving.'' If a branch split into three daughter branches, their cross-sectional areas had to add up to that of the parent branch. This would insure that blood or sap  would continue to move at the same speed throughout the organism.

The scientists were delighted to see that the model gave rise to three-quarter-power scaling between metabolic rate and body mass. But the system worked only for plants. ''We worked through the model and made clear predictions about mammals,'' Dr. Brown said, ''every single one of which was wrong.''

In making the model as simple as possible, the scientists had hoped they could ignore the fact that blood is pumped by the heart in pulses and treat mammals as though they were trees. After studying hydrodynamics, they realized they needed a way to slow the pulsing blood as the vessels got tinier and tinier. These finer parts of the network would not be area-preserving but area-increasing: the cross sections of the daughter branches would add up to a sum greater than the parent branch, spreading the blood over a larger area.

After adding these and other complications, they found that the model also predicted three-quarter-power scaling in mammals. Other quarter-power scaling laws also emerged naturally from the equations. Evolution, it seemed, has overcome the natural limitations of simple geometric scaling by developing these very efficient fractal-like webs.

The Model  Strange Prediction Comes to Pass

Sometimes it all seemed too good to be true. One Friday night, Dr. West was at home playing with the equations when he realized to his chagrin that the model predicted that all mammals must have about the same blood pressure. That could not be right, he thought. After a restless weekend, he called Dr. Brown, who told him that indeed this was so.

The model was revealed, about two years after the collaboration began, on April 4, 1997, in an article in Science. A follow-up last fall in Nature extended the ideas further into the plant world.

More recently the three collaborators have been puzzling over the fact  that a version of Kleiber's law also seems to apply to single cells and  even to the energy-burning mitochondria inside cells. They assume this is because the mitochondria inside the cytoplasm and even the respiratory components inside the mitochondria are arranged in fractal-like networks.

For all the excitement the model has caused, there are still skeptics. A  paper published last year in American Naturalist by two scientists in Poland, Dr. Jan Kozlowski and Dr. January Weiner, suggests the possibility that quarter-power scaling across species could be nothing more than a statistical illusion. And biologists persist in confronting the collaborators with single species in which quarter-power scaling laws do not seem to hold.

Dr. West is not too bothered by these seeming exceptions. The history of physics is replete with cases where an elegant model came up against some recalcitrant data, and the model eventually won. He is now working with other collaborators to see whether river systems, which look remarkably like circulatory systems, and even the hierarchical structure of corporations obey the same kind of scaling laws.

The overarching lesson, Dr. West says, is that as organisms grow in size they become more efficient. ''That is why nature has evolved  large animals,'' he said. ''It's a much better way of utilizing energy. This might also explain the drive for corporations to merge. Small may be beautiful, but it is more efficient to be big.''

Size, by the Numbers

It might seem that since a cat is 100 times bigger than a mouse, its metabolism (the rate at which it burns energy) would be 100 times faster. But under Kleiber's law, metabolism scales to body mass to the three-quarter power. To calculate this, take 100 to the third power: 100 x 100 x 100 = 1,000,000. Then take the square root of this number twice. The answer is about 31.6.

	AIDS Fungus Drug Offered to Poor Nations


The Pfizer pharmaceutical company announced today that it will offer the governments of more than 50 of the world's poorest nations an unlimited free supply of a powerful drug to combat fungal infections associated with AIDS.

The company began providing the drug, which it markets under the brand name Diflucan, to South Africa early this year under a program that company officials said will cost $50 million over two years. At a news conference here today, Henry McKinnell, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive officer, said that the project will now be extended to five other countries in the region -- Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia and Swaziland.

Pfizer said that it was inviting the governments of all 50 countries that the United Nations considers to be the world's poorest and most affected by AIDS to participate in the project.

''There is no time or dollar limit set on this program,'' Dr. McKinnell  said. ''We are ready to begin providing Diflucan immediately.'' Governments would be expected to sign an agreement assuring Pfizer that the drug would be distributed free.

Dr. McKinnell said that Pfizer would also provide ''medical training and patient education.'' Next week, the company is expected to announce its participation in the establishment of an AIDS medical training center in Uganda.

Pfizer's plan to provide a leading drug free of charge to governments follows a round of price reductions by pharmaceutical companies on antiretroviral treatments that can prolong the lives of people infected with the virus that causes AIDS.

Diflucan is used to treat cryptococcal meningitis, an infection of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord that occurs in one of every 10 AIDS patients and kills more than 20 percent of those affected. The drug is also used to treat a condition known as esophageal candidiasis, a fungal infection of the esophagus found in 20 percent to 40 percent of AIDS patients. It can cause chest pain, nausea and vomiting as well as impair the ability to swallow, which leads to weight loss and fatigue.

The announcement by Pfizer was welcomed guardedly by groups for greater generosity from pharmaceutical companies in the fight against AIDS. American drug manufacturers have been widely criticized for pricing products out of the reach of most nations, then opposing efforts by foreign companies to make and sell the same or similar medicines at considerably lower prices.

Joel B. Pressley, executive director of the New York AIDS Coalition, who shared the platform with Dr. McKinnell at the news conference today, said that he ''truly applauds'' Pfizer's decision. He added: ''Crypto meningitis is but one of the numerous serious issues that have to be addressed in a comprehensive public health approach in dealing with the H.I.V.-AIDS epidemic. Pfizer has made a step in the right direction, a major step. However, it and other pharmaceuticals along with policymakers near and far must make giant strides to find proactive, creative and comprehensive solutions to stem and stop the tide of despair and misery.''

Pfizer has been under pressure for several years from the makers of generic copies of Diflucan. The leading competitors are three Thai companies, a Bangladeshi firm and Cipla in India, which admits that under Indian law it can produce knock-offs of all Pfizer drugs.

Pfizer patented Diflucan in 1982 and it remains patented until 2004 in the United States and many other countries. The drug is used in the United States to treat toenail fungus, and several kinds of thrush as well as cryptococcal meningitis.

Dr. McKinnell acknowledged today that the company was intent on keeping its market share even after patents expire. The provision of free supplies of the leading drug in its field can boost the image of the company, critics say.

Paul S. Zeitz, a physician and epidemiologist with 12 years of work on AIDS in Africa, described Pfizer's move today as ''a strategy to block access to generically manufactured drugs.'' Dr. Zeitz earlier this year founded the Global AIDS Alliance, based in Philadelphia, to campaign on many fronts for faster and more effective help for poor countries caught in the AIDS crisis.

He said that the agreements Pfizer concludes with poor nations should be scrutinized carefully. ''We don't know the details of the written deal,'' he said. ''What kind of influence are they buying with this? Are there unwritten ways that the pharmaceutical companies are influencing the governments? We think there should be open, fair competitive bidding between generics and competitive brands. A free donor program effectively blocks the demand for the generically manufactured drugs.''

The Pfizer announcement was welcomed by Peter Piot, the director of Unaids, the joint program of the World Health Organization and other United Nations agencies involved in dealing with the epidemic. He said it would have ''a significant impact.''

South Africa's ambassador to the United States, Sheila V.M. Sisulu, also endorsed the project today at the news conference.

In the United States, Pfizer officials say, Diflucan costs about $10 a daily dose, and must be taken for life in cases of cryptococcal meningitis.

	COMPANIES TO CUT COST OF AIDS DRUGS FOR POOR NATIONS


Five pharmaceutical companies offered today to negotiate steep cuts in the price of AIDS drugs for Africa and other poor regions afflicted by the disease.

The announcement of negotiations, to be held with the World Health Organization and other international aid groups, was made in Geneva. It followed mounting pressure on the companies -- including a personal appeal from the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, at a special session on AIDS in December -- to make their therapies more accessible in Africa, Asia and other regions devastated by the epidemic.

Dr. Peter Piot, the executive director of Unaids, a joint United Nations agency, said, ''This is a promising step in a long-term process.'' He added, ''Lowering the price of medicines, however, is only one critical factor in what must become a much broader and more urgent effort.''

In many parts of Africa, government health budgets can be as little as $10 a person a year, and treatment programs are hard to carry out, even among people who acknowledge having the disease.

Some 50 million poor people in developing nations are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. The participants in today's accord emphasized that they were at the beginning of a process and did not predict how many people might be helped soon.

Though only one company, Glaxo Wellcome, spoke of any specific prices, the companies were expected to agree to cuts of 80 percent and more below their American prices. Drug treatments used in the United States, most commonly the triple-therapy ''cocktails'' that suppress the replication of H.I.V., can cost up to $15,000 a year.

Dr. Rolf Krebs, vice chairman of one of the five companies, Boehringer Ingelheim, which is based in Germany, said, ''This is the first time that both the public and private sector are joining forces to implement a major change in the care of H.I.V./AIDS in the developing world.''

Besides Boehringer, the other companies in today's agreement are Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck &amp; Company, both of the United States; Glaxo Wellcome of Britain, and Hoffmann-La Roche of Switzerland.

Ben Plumley, an official of Glaxo Wellcome, said the company would sell its Combivir, a blend of AZT and 3TC that sells at a global average price of $16, for $2 in poor countries.

The announcement of the agreements, first reported in The Wall Street Journal, followed several weeks of negotiations. Officials said the companies negotiated separately to avoid falling afoul of American price-fixing laws.

The five companies will work with five international agencies, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, Unaids, the United Nations Children's Fund and the United Nations Population Fund.

At world trade conferences like the one in Seattle in December that attracted many protesters, drug companies have been portrayed as racking up record profits by concentrating on drugs to cure relatively minor problems like obesity, baldness and impotence among rich Americans, Western Europeans and Japanese, who make up 80 percent of the world drug market, while ignoring dire suffering in places like Africa, which buys 1 percent of the world's drugs.

Gro Harlem Brundtland, the director general of the World Health Organization, said in an interview today that big pharmaceutical companies had ''analyzed their roles more broadly recently.''

''The reality of poverty and the affordability of medical technology has led companies to think about their policies and postures,'' she said.

But officials in Geneva and elsewhere cautioned that cheaper drugs would not provide a quick fix for the epidemic.

They stressed that controlling AIDS also required a developed health-care system, which many third world countries lack, and that even slashed prices might be too high for many patients. They also said they feared that the cheap drugs could find their way into black markets in richer countries.

By some estimates, sub-Saharan Africa has 80 percent of the world population of people infected by H.I.V., though few of those people have ever had an AIDS test.

In much of Africa, the disease is treated as a badge of shame. And the anti-retrovirals, protease inhibitors and other drugs involved are toxic and difficult to monitor even in patients in Manhattan.

In many poor countries, distributing the drugs, teaching people to take them and monitoring levels of virus, T-cells and drug residues in the blood amount to a mammoth task.

''To be realistic, this is not going to fix the problem, but I'm cautiously optimistic,'' said Dr. Piot, of Unaids.  While the agencies involved in today's accord emphasized the hope of lower prices, the drug companies focused on joint principles for tackling the epidemic. These include stronger government efforts, better drug-distribution systems and more financing from donors, all matters outside the corporate world. Who would pay to create such standards remains unclear.

Most of the drugs scheduled to come under discussion are those used to control replication of H.I.V. But the poor also need other medicines, like strong antibiotic and anti-fungal drugs for the infections that arise with AIDS.

Cutting prices is in some ways a risky concession by the companies. Soaring prescription prices in the United States have led some lawmakers to call for European-style price controls. If the drug companies in effect admit that they can sell a drug at an 80 percent discount, they risk Congressional pressure to lower Medicare prices. But over time, the industry argues, skimpy prices would strangle their immense research budgets, and the flow of valuable new drugs would stop.

Some AIDS activists argue that the companies are lowering prices simply to forestall the seizure of their patents by third world nations desperate for the drugs. Thailand and South Africa have recently passed laws allowing such seizure; India, Bangladesh and Brazil have drug industries that ignore patent treaties.

On Wednesday, the Clinton administration angered the industry by issuing an executive order saying the government would not interfere with African countries that violate American patent law to obtain cheaper AIDS drugs.

The companies denied that they had asked for any quid pro quo, like demanding that countries pass tough patent laws or that the United Nations agencies endorse them. ''No, we're not asking for a ban on parallel imports or compulsory licensing,'' said Jacqueline Wallace, a Roche press spokeswoman. ''That would be illegal.''

The fear of all five companies is that corruption in poor countries is so rampant that millions of their cut-rate pills will disappear and be sent to rich countries to cannibalize their full-price sales.

''That's precisely one of the things that's worried us,'' said Jeffrey Sturchio of Merck &amp; Company. ''That's something we hope this initiative will be able to address.''

Today's announcement was greeted with skepticism by Doctors Without Borders, the Nobel Prize-winning medical agency. The opening of discussions ''is a victory, but a small one, much like an elephant giving birth to a mouse,'' said Dr. Bernard Pecoul, who cited the lack of any concrete commitments.

A Clinton administration official said the administration had not played much of a role in events that led to the agreement.

Poor people in the United States, unlike those in poor countries, have several ways of obtaining AIDS drugs. Medicaid generally covers the costs of such drugs. Low-income people who do not qualify for Medicaid may be able to obtain drug therapy through AIDS drug assistance programs run by the states with substantial federal money.

In addition, drug manufacturers have programs to provide drugs free, as a last resort, to patients who have no health insurance.

But Daniel Zingale, former executive director of AIDS Action, a lobby for people affected by the disease, said: ''There are still some people in the United States who cannot get the drugs they need because the price is prohibitive. It costs $15,000 to $17,000 a year just for H.I.V. drugs.''

Glaxo's Combivir, a combination of retrovir and epivir anti-viral drugs, generated $454 million in 1999 sales, but only 10 percent came from outside the United States and Europe.

''They don't have a great deal to lose,'' James Culverwell, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London, told Reuters. ''I don't imagine the financial effect is that significant.''

	How Islam Won, and Lost, the Lead in Science


Nasir al-Din al-Tusi was still a young man when the Assassins made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

His hometown had been devastated by Mongol armies, and so, early in the 13th century, al-Tusi, a promising astronomer and philosopher, came to dwell in the legendary fortress city of Alamut in the mountains of northern Persia.

He lived among a heretical and secretive sect of Shiite Muslims, whose members practiced political murder as a tactic and were dubbed hashishinn, legend has it, because of their use of hashish.

Although al-Tusi later said he had been held in Alamut against his will, the library there was renowned for its excellence, and al-Tusi thrived there, publishing works on astronomy, ethics, mathematics and philosophy that marked him as one of the great intellectuals of his age.

But when the armies of Halagu, the grandson of Genghis Khan, massed outside the city in 1256, al-Tusi had little trouble deciding where his loyalties lay. He joined Halagu and accompanied him to Baghdad, which fell in 1258. The grateful Halagu built him an observatory at Maragha, in what is now northwestern Iran.

Al-Tusi's deftness and ideological flexibility in pursuit of the resources to do science paid off. The road to modern astronomy, scholars say, leads through the work that he and his followers performed at Maragha and Alamut in the 13th and 14th centuries. It is a road that winds from Athens to Alexandria, Baghdad, Damascus and Córdoba, through the palaces of caliphs and the basement laboratories of alchemists, and it was traveled not just by astronomy but by all science.

Commanded by the Koran to seek knowledge and read nature for signs of the Creator, and inspired by a treasure trove of ancient Greek learning, Muslims created a society that in the Middle Ages was the scientific center of the world. The Arabic language was synonymous with learning and science for 500 hundred years, a golden age that can count among its credits the precursors to modern universities, algebra, the names of the stars and even the notion of science as an empirical inquiry.

''Nothing in Europe could hold a candle to what was going on in the Islamic world until about 1600,'' said Dr. Jamil Ragep, a professor of the history of science at the University of Oklahoma.

It was the infusion of this knowledge into Western Europe, historians say, that fueled the Renaissance and the scientific revolution.

''Civilizations don't just clash,'' said Dr. Abdelhamid Sabra, a retired professor of the history of Arabic science who taught at Harvard. ''They can learn from each other. Islam is a good example of that.'' The intellectual meeting of Arabia and Greece was one of the greatest events in history, he said. ''Its scale and consequences are enormous, not just for Islam but for Europe and the world.''

But historians say they still know very little about this golden age. Few of the major scientific works from that era have been translated from Arabic, and thousands of manuscripts have never even been read by modern scholars. Dr. Sabra characterizes the history of Islamic science as a field that ''hasn't even begun yet.''

Islam's rich intellectual history, scholars are at pains and seem saddened and embarrassed to point out, belies the image cast by recent world events. Traditionally, Islam has encouraged science and learning. ''There is no conflict between Islam and science,'' said Dr. Osman Bakar of the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown.

''Knowledge is part of the creed,'' added Dr. Farouk El-Baz, a geologist at Boston University, who was science adviser to President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt. ''When you know more, you see more evidence of God.''

So the notion that modern Islamic science is now considered ''abysmal,'' as Abdus Salam, the first Muslim to win a Nobel Prize in Physics, once put it, haunts Eastern scholars.  ''Muslims have a kind of nostalgia for the past, when they could contend that they were the dominant cultivators of science,'' Dr. Bakar said. The relation between science and religion has generated much debate in the Islamic world, he and other scholars said. Some scientists and historians call for an ''Islamic science'' informed by spiritual values they say Western science ignores, but others argue that a religious conservatism in the East has dampened the skeptical spirit necessary for good science.

The Golden Age

When Muhammad's armies swept out from the Arabian peninsula in the seventh and eighth centuries, annexing territory from Spain to Persia, they also annexed the works of Plato, Aristotle, Democritus, Pythagoras, Archimedes, Hippocrates and other Greek thinkers.

Hellenistic culture had been spread eastward by the armies of Alexander the Great and by religious minorities, including various Christian sects, according to Dr. David Lindberg, a medieval science historian at the University of Wisconsin.

The largely illiterate Muslim conquerors turned to the local intelligentsia to help them govern, Dr. Lindberg said. In the process, he said, they absorbed Greek learning that had yet to be transmitted to the West in a serious way, or even translated into Latin. ''The West had a thin version of Greek knowledge,'' Dr. Lindberg said. ''The East had it all.''

In ninth-century Baghdad the Caliph Abu al-Abbas al-Mamun set up an institute, the House of Wisdom, to translate manuscripts. Among the first works rendered into Arabic was the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy's ''Great Work,'' which described a universe in which the Sun, Moon, planets and stars revolved around Earth; Al-Magest, as the work was known to Arabic scholars, became the basis for cosmology for the next 500 years.

Jews, Christians and Muslims all participated in this flowering of science, art, medicine and philosophy, which endured for at least 500 years and spread from Spain to Persia. Its height, historians say, was in the 10th and 11th centuries when three great thinkers strode the East: Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham, also known as Alhazen; Abu Rayham Muhammad al-Biruni; and Abu Ali al-Hussein Ibn Sina, also known as Avicenna.

Al-Haytham, born in Iraq in 965, experimented with light and vision, laying the foundation for modern optics and for the notion that science should be based on experiment as well as on philosophical arguments. ''He ranks with Archimedes, Kepler and Newton as a great mathematical scientist,'' said Dr. Lindberg.

The mathematician, astronomer and geographer al-Biruni, born in what is now part of Uzbekistan in 973, wrote some 146 works totaling 13,000 pages, including a vast sociological and geographical study of India.

Ibn Sina was a physician and philosopher born near Bukhara (now in Uzbekistan) in 981. He compiled a million-word medical encyclopedia, the Canons of Medicine, that was used as a textbook in parts of the West until the 17th century.

Scholars say science found such favor in medieval Islam for several reasons. Part of the allure was mystical; it was another way to experience the unity of creation that was the central message of Islam.

''Anyone who studies anatomy will increase his faith in the omnipotence and oneness of God the Almighty,'' goes a saying often attributed to Abul-Walid Muhammad Ibn Rushd, also known as Averroes, a 13th-century anatomist and philosopher.

Knocking on Heaven's Door

Another reason is that Islam is one of the few religions in human history in which scientific procedures are necessary for religious ritual, Dr. David King, a historian of science at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt, pointed out in his book ''Astronomy in the Service of Islam,'' published in 1993. Arabs had always been knowledgeable about the stars and used them to navigate the desert, but Islam raised the stakes for astronomy.

The requirement that Muslims face in the direction of Mecca when they pray, for example, required knowledge of the size and shape of the Earth. The best astronomical minds of the Muslim world tackled the job of producing tables or diagrams by which the qibla, or sacred directions, could be found from any point in the Islamic world. Their efforts rose to a precision far beyond the needs of the peasants who would use them, noted Dr. King.

Astronomers at the Samarkand observatory, which was founded about 1420 by the ruler Ulugh Beg, measured star positions to a fraction of a degree, said Dr. El-Baz.

Islamic astronomy reached its zenith, at least from the Western perspective, in the 13th and 14th centuries, when al-Tusi and his successors pushed against the limits of the Ptolemaic world view that had ruled for a millennium.

According to the philosophers, celestial bodies were supposed to move in circles at uniform speeds. But the beauty of Ptolemy's attempt to explain the very ununiform motions of planets and the Sun as seen from Earth was marred by corrections like orbits within orbits, known as epicycles, and geometrical modifications.

Al-Tusi found a way to restore most of the symmetry to Ptolemy's  model by adding pairs of cleverly designed epicycles to each orbit. Following in al-Tusi's footsteps, the 14th-century astronomer Ala al-Din Abul-Hasan ibn al-Shatir had managed to go further and construct a completely symmetrical model.

Copernicus, who overturned the Ptolemaic universe in 1530 by proposing that the planets revolved around the Sun, expressed ideas similar to the Muslim astronomers in his early writings. This has led some historians to suggest that there is a previously unknown link between Copernicus and the Islamic astronomers, even though neither ibn al-Shatir's nor al-Tusi's work is known to have ever been translated into Latin, and therefore was presumably unknown in the West.

Dr. Owen Gingerich, an astronomer and historian of astronomy at Harvard, said he believed that Copernicus could have developed the ideas independently, but wrote in Scientific American that the whole idea of criticizing Ptolemy and reforming his model was part of ''the climate of opinion inherited by the Latin West from Islam.''

The Decline of the East

Despite their awareness of Ptolemy's flaws, Islamic astronomers were a long ways from throwing out his model: dismissing it would have required a philosophical as well as cosmological revolution. ''In some ways it was beginning to happen,'' said Dr. Ragep of the University of Oklahoma. But the East had no need of heliocentric models of the universe, said Dr. King of Frankfurt. All motion being relative, he said, it was irrelevant for the purposes of Muslim rituals whether the sun went around the Earth or vice versa.

From the 10th to the 13th century Europeans, especially in Spain, were translating Arabic works into Hebrew and Latin ''as fast as they could,'' said Dr. King. The result was a rebirth of learning that ultimately transformed Western civilization.

Why didn't Eastern science go forward as well? ''Nobody has answered that question satisfactorily,'' said Dr. Sabra of Harvard. Pressed, historians offer up a constellation of reasons. Among other things, the Islamic empire began to be whittled away in the 13th century by Crusaders from the West and Mongols from the East.

Christians reconquered Spain and its magnificent libraries in Córdoba and Toledo, full of Arab learning. As a result, Islamic centers of learning began to lose touch with one another and with the West, leading to a gradual erosion in two of the main pillars of science -- communication and financial support.

In the West, science was able to pay for itself in new technology like the steam engine and to attract financing from industry, but in the East it remained dependent on the patronage and curiosity of sultans and caliphs. Further, the Ottomans, who took over the Arabic lands in the 16th century, were builders and conquerors, not thinkers, said Dr. El-Baz of Boston University, and support waned. ''You cannot expect the science to be excellent while the society is not,'' he said.

Others argue, however, that Islamic science seems to decline only when viewed through Western, secular eyes. ''It's possible to live without an industrial revolution if you have enough camels and food,'' Dr. King said.

''Why did Muslim science decline?'' he said. ''That's a very Western question. It flourished for a thousand years -- no civilization on Earth has flourished that long in that way.''

Islamic Science Wars

Humiliating encounters with Western colonial powers in the 19th century produced a hunger for Western science and technology, or at least the economic and military power they could produce, scholars say. Reformers bent on modernizing Eastern educational systems to include Western science could argue that Muslims would only be reclaiming their own, since the West had inherited science from the Islamic world to begin with.

In some ways these efforts have been very successful. ''In particular countries the science syllabus is quite modern,'' said Dr. Bakar of Georgetown, citing Malaysia, Jordan and Pakistan, in particular. Even in Saudi Arabia, one of the most conservative Muslim states, science classes are conducted in English, Dr. Sabra said.

Nevertheless, science still lags in the Muslim world, according to Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy, a Pakistani physicist and professor at Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad, who has written on Islam and science. According to his own informal survey, included in his 1991 book ''Islam and Science, Religious Orthodoxy and the Battle for Rationality,'' Muslims are seriously underrepresented in science, accounting for fewer than 1 percent of the world's scientists while they account for almost a fifth of the world's population. Israel, he reports, has almost twice as many scientists as the Muslim countries put together.

Among other sociological and economic factors, like the lack of a middle class, Dr. Hoodbhoy attributes the malaise of Muslim science to an increasing emphasis over the last millennium on rote learning based on the Koran.

''The notion that all knowledge is in the Great Text is a great disincentive to learning,'' he said. ''It's destructive if we want to create a thinking person, someone who can analyze, question and create.'' Dr. Bruno Guideroni, a Muslim who is an astrophysicist at the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris, said, ''The fundamentalists criticize science simply because it is Western.''

Other scholars said the attitude of conservative Muslims to science was not so much hostile as schizophrenic, wanting its benefits but not its world view. ''They may use modern technology, but they don't deal with issues of religion and science.'' said Dr. Bakar.

One response to the invasion of Western science, said the scientists, has been an effort to ''Islamicize'' science by portraying the Koran as a source of scientific knowledge.

Dr. Hoodbhoy said such groups had criticized the concept of cause and effect. Educational guidelines once issued by the Institute for Policy Studies in Pakistan, for example,  included the recommendation that physical effects not be related to causes.

For example, it was not Islamic to say that combining hydrogen and oxygen makes water. ''You were supposed to say,'' Dr. Hoodbhoy recounted, ''that when you bring hydrogen and oxygen together then by the will of Allah water was created.''

Even Muslims who reject fundamentalism, however, have expressed doubts about the desirability of following the Western style of science, saying that it subverts traditional spiritual values and promotes materialism and alienation.

''No science is created in a vacuum,'' said Dr. Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a science historian, author, philosopher and professor of Islamic studies at George Washington University, during a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology a few years ago. ''Science arose under particular circumstances in the West with certain philosophical presumptions about the nature of reality.''

Dr. Muzaffar Iqbal, a chemist and the president and founder of the Center for Islam and Science in Alberta, Canada, explained: ''Modern science doesn't claim to address the purpose of life; that is outside the domain. In the Islamic world, purpose is integral, part of that life.''

Most working scientists tend to scoff at the notion that science can be divided into ethnic, religious or any other kind of flavor. There is only one universe. The process of asking and answering questions about nature, they say, eventually erases the particular circumstances from which those questions arise.

In his book, Dr. Hoodbhoy recounts how Dr. Salam, Dr. Steven Weinberg, now at the University of Texas, and Dr. Sheldon Glashow at Harvard, shared the Nobel Prize for showing that electromagnetism and the so-called weak nuclear force are different manifestations of a single force.

Dr. Salam and Dr. Weinberg had devised the same contribution to that theory independently, he wrote, despite the fact that Dr. Weinberg is an atheist while Dr. Salam was a Muslim who prayed regularly and quoted from the Koran. Dr. Salam confirmed the account in his introduction to the book, describing himself as ''geographically and ideologically remote'' from Dr. Weinberg.

''Science is international,'' said Dr. El-Baz. ''There is no such thing as Islamic science. Science is like building a big building, a pyramid. Each person puts up a block. These blocks have never had a religion. It's irrelevant, the color of the guy who put up the block.''

	Scholars Are Quietly Offering New Theories of the Koran


To Muslims the Koran is the very word of God, who spoke through the Angel Gabriel to Muhammad: ''This book is not to be doubted,'' the Koran declares unequivocally at its beginning. Scholars and writers in Islamic countries who have ignored that warning have sometimes found themselves the target of death threats and violence, sending a chill through universities around the world.

Yet despite the fear, a handful of experts have been quietly investigating the origins of the Koran, offering radically new theories about the text's meaning and the rise of Islam.

Christoph Luxenberg, a scholar of ancient Semitic languages in Germany, argues that the Koran has been misread and mistranslated for centuries. His work, based on the earliest copies of the Koran, maintains that parts of Islam's holy book are derived from pre-existing Christian Aramaic texts that were misinterpreted by later Islamic scholars who prepared the editions of the Koran commonly read today.

So, for example, the virgins who are supposedly awaiting good Islamic martyrs as their reward in paradise are in reality ''white raisins'' of crystal clarity rather than fair maidens.

Christoph Luxenberg, however, is a pseudonym, and his scholarly tome ''''The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran'' had trouble finding a publisher, although it is considered a major new work by several leading scholars in the field. Verlag Das Arabische Buch in Berlin ultimately published the book.

The caution is not surprising. Salman Rushdie's ''Satanic Verses'' received a fatwa because it appeared to mock Muhammad. The Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was stabbed because one of his books was thought to be irreligious. And when the Arab scholar Suliman Bashear argued that Islam developed as a religion gradually rather than emerging fully formed from the mouth of the Prophet, he was injured after being thrown from a second-story window by his students at the University of Nablus in the West Bank. Even many broad-minded liberal Muslims become upset when the historical veracity and authenticity of the Koran is questioned.

The reverberations have affected non-Muslim scholars in Western countries. ''Between fear and political correctness, it's not possible to say anything other than sugary nonsense about Islam,'' said one scholar at an American university who asked not to be named, referring to the threatened violence as well as the widespread reluctance on United States college campuses to criticize other cultures.

While scriptural interpretation may seem like a remote and innocuous activity, close textual study of Jewish and Christian scripture played no small role in loosening the Church's domination on the intellectual and cultural life of Europe, and paving the way for unfettered secular thought. ''The Muslims have the benefit of hindsight of the European experience, and they know very well that once you start questioning the holy scriptures, you don't know where it will stop,'' the scholar explained.

The touchiness about questioning the Koran predates the latest rise of Islamic militancy. As long ago as 1977, John Wansbrough of the School of Oriental and African Studies in London wrote that subjecting the Koran to ''analysis by the instruments and techniques of biblical criticism is virtually unknown.''

Mr. Wansbrough insisted that the text of the Koran appeared to be a composite of different voices or texts compiled over dozens if not hundreds of years. After all, scholars agree that there is no evidence of the Koran until 691 -- 59 years after Muhammad's death -- when the Dome of the Rock mosque in Jerusalem was built, carrying several Koranic inscriptions.

These inscriptions differ to some degree from the version of the Koran that has been handed down through the centuries, suggesting, scholars say, that the Koran may have still been evolving in the last decade of the seventh century. Moreover, much of what we know as Islam -- the lives and sayings of the Prophet -- is based on texts from between 130 and 300 years after Muhammad's death.

In 1977 two other scholars from the School for Oriental and African Studies at London University -- Patricia Crone (a professor of history at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton) and Michael Cook (a professor of Near Eastern history at Princeton University) -- suggested a radically new approach in their book ''Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World.''

Since there are no Arabic chronicles from the first century of Islam, the two looked at several non-Muslim, seventh-century accounts that suggested Muhammad was perceived not as the founder of a new religion but as a preacher in the Old Testament tradition, hailing the coming of a Messiah. Many of the early documents refer to the followers of Muhammad as ''hagarenes,'' and the ''tribe of Ishmael,'' in other words as descendants of Hagar, the servant girl that the Jewish patriarch Abraham used to father his son Ishmael.

In its earliest form, Ms. Crone and Mr. Cook argued, the followers of Muhammad may have seen themselves as retaking their place in the Holy Land alongside their Jewish cousins. (And many Jews appear to have welcomed the Arabs as liberators when they entered Jerusalem in 638.)

The idea that Jewish messianism animated the early followers of the Prophet is not widely accepted in the field, but ''Hagarism'' is credited with opening up the field. ''Crone and Cook came up with some very interesting revisionist ideas,'' says Fred M. Donner of the University of Chicago and author of the recent book ''Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing.'' ''I think in trying to reconstruct what happened, they went off the deep end, but they were asking the right questions.''

The revisionist school of early Islam  has quietly picked up momentum in the last few years as historians began to apply rational standards of proof to this material.

Mr. Cook and Ms. Crone have revised some of their early hypotheses while sticking to others. ''We were certainly wrong about quite a lot of things,'' Ms. Crone said. ''But I stick to the basic point we made: that Islamic history did not arise as the classic tradition says it does.''

Ms. Crone insists that the Koran and the Islamic tradition present a fundamental paradox. The Koran is a text soaked in monotheistic thinking, filled with stories and references to Abraham, Isaac, Joseph and Jesus, and yet the official history insists that Muhammad, an illiterate camel merchant, received the revelation in Mecca, a remote, sparsely populated part of Arabia, far from the centers of monotheistic thought, in an environment of idol-worshiping Arab Bedouins. Unless one accepts the idea of the angel Gabriel, Ms. Crone says, historians must somehow explain how all these monotheistic stories and ideas found their way into the Koran.

''There are only two possibilities,'' Ms. Crone said. ''Either there had to be substantial numbers of Jews and Christians in Mecca or the Koran had to have been composed somewhere else.''

Indeed, many scholars who are not revisionists agree that Islam must be placed back into the wider historical context of the religions of the Middle East rather than seeing it as the spontaneous product of the pristine Arabian desert. ''I think there is increasing acceptance, even on the part of many Muslims, that Islam emerged out of the wider monotheistic soup of the Middle East,'' says Roy Mottahedeh, a professor of Islamic history at Harvard University.

Scholars like Mr. Luxenberg and Gerd-R. Puin, who teaches at Saarland University in Germany, have returned to the earliest known copies of the Koran in order to grasp what it says about the document's origins and composition. Mr. Luxenberg explains these copies are written without vowels and diacritical dots that modern Arabic uses to make it clear what letter is intended. In the eighth and ninth centuries, more than a century after the death of Muhammad, Islamic commentators added diacritical marks to clear up the ambiguities of the text, giving precise meanings to passages based on what they considered to be their proper context. Mr. Luxenberg's radical theory is that many of the text's difficulties can be clarified when it is seen as closely related to Aramaic, the language group of most Middle Eastern Jews and Christians at the time.

For example, the famous passage about the virgins is based on the word hur, which is an adjective in the feminine plural meaning simply ''white.'' Islamic tradition insists the term hur stands for ''houri,'' which means virgin, but Mr. Luxenberg insists that this is a forced misreading of the text. In both ancient Aramaic and in at least one respected dictionary of early Arabic, hur means ''white raisin.''

Mr. Luxenberg has traced the passages dealing with paradise to a Christian text called Hymns of Paradise by a fourth-century author. Mr. Luxenberg said the word paradise was derived from the Aramaic word for garden and all the descriptions of paradise described it as a garden of flowing waters, abundant fruits and white raisins, a prized delicacy in the ancient Near East. In this context, white raisins, mentioned often as hur, Mr. Luxenberg said, makes more sense than a reward of sexual favors.

In many cases, the differences can be quite significant. Mr. Puin points out that in the early archaic copies of the Koran, it is impossible to distinguish between the words ''to fight'' and ''to kill.'' In many cases, he said, Islamic exegetes added diacritical marks that yielded the harsher meaning, perhaps reflecting a period in which the Islamic Empire was often at war.

A return to the earliest Koran, Mr. Puin and others suggest, might lead to a more tolerant brand of Islam, as well as one that is more conscious of its close ties to both Judaism and Christianity.

''It is serious and exciting work,'' Ms. Crone said of Mr. Luxenberg's work. Jane McAuliffe, a professor of Islamic studies at Georgetown University, has asked Mr. Luxenberg to contribute an essay to the Encyclopedia of the Koran, which she is editing.

Mr. Puin would love to see a ''critical edition'' of the Koran produced, one based on recent philological work, but, he says, ''the word critical is misunderstood in the Islamic world -- it is seen as criticizing or attacking the text.''

Some Muslim authors have begun to publish skeptical, revisionist work on the Koran as well. Several new volumes of revisionist scholarship, ''The Origins of the Koran,'' and ''The Quest for the Historical Muhammad,'' have been edited by a former Muslim who writes under the pen name Ibn Warraq. Mr. Warraq, who heads a group called the Institute for the Secularization of Islamic Society, makes no bones about having a political agenda. ''Biblical scholarship has made people less dogmatic, more open,'' he said, ''and I hope that happens to Muslim society as well.''

But many Muslims find the tone and claims of revisionism offensive. ''I think the broader implications of some of the revisionist scholarship is to say that the Koran is not an authentic book, that it was fabricated 150 years later,'' says Ebrahim Moosa, a professor of religious studies at Duke University, as well as a Muslim cleric whose liberal theological leanings earned him the animosity of fundamentalists in South Africa, which he left after his house was firebombed.

Andrew Rippin, an Islamicist at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada, says that freedom of speech in the Islamic world is more likely to evolve from within the Islamic interpretative tradition than from outside attacks on it. Approaches to the Koran that are now branded as heretical -- interpreting the text metaphorically rather than literally -- were widely practiced in mainstream Islam a thousand years ago.

''When I teach the history of the interpretation it is eye-opening to students the amount of independent thought and diversity of interpretation that existed in the early centuries of Islam,'' Mr. Rippin says. ''It was only in more recent centuries that there was a need for limiting interpretation.''
